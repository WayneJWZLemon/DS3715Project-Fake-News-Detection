How this fruit became the star of Italian cooking,"(CNN) — Paolo Gramaglia loves tomatoes. The owner and chef of the Michelin-starred President restaurant in Pompeii, his link with the fruit is so strong, he says, that he and it are intrinsically entwined.

Not that he thinks he's special -- he thinks all Italians have the same relationship with the pomodoro.

""Tomatoes are in our DNA,"" he says. ""We grow up with tomato in our recipes. They've become the symbol of our gastronomy.""

And he's right. Whether it's a scarlet-slicked pizza or a red-sauced spaghetti al pomodoro, Italy's most instantly recognizable dishes both include tomato. Even the emoji for pasta isn't just pasta -- it's a steaming plate of spaghetti heaped with tomato sauce on top.

But while today we think of tomatoes as inextricably linked to Italian food, that hasn't always been the case. In fact, it was only during the 19th century that tomatoes really hit the tables of the Bel Paese. Before that, it was widely thought they were poisonous.

The ingredient that makes a pizza pizza and pasta pasta -- how could tomatoes not be native to Italy?

""People tend to think Italian food was always as it is now -- that Dante was eating pizza,"" says Dr Eva Del Soldato , associate professor of romance languages at the University of Pennsylvania, who leads courses on Italian food history.

In fact, she says, Italy's complex history -- it wasn't unified until 1861 -- means that what we think of Italian food is, for the most part, a relatively modern concept. Until recently, individual regions kept rigorously to their own cuisines, and today, even though many dishes have broken through, I talian cooking is still region-based

""I'm from Tuscany and was fascinated by the explosion in popularity of kale in the US, because in Tuscany it's historically been considered 'poor food,' certainly not the expensive millennial ingredient I see people eating here,"" she says.

""Many times we don't think of food in historical terms, but history and political relationships have had an impact on the way we eat -- not just society and changes in diet,"" she says.

The political tomato

The tomato, it turns out, has always been political. Brought to Europe by the Spanish when they colonized the Americas -- it's an Aztec plant, as we can tell by its original name, ""tomatl"" -- by the mid-1500s, it had made its way to Italy.

Nobody quite knows how -- some think the Sephardic Jews, expelled from Spain in 1492, could have brought it with them. Or maybe it made its way over with Eleanor of Toledo, who came to Florence when she married the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo I de' Medici, in 1539.

Either way, by 1548, the tomato was to be found in Cosimo's botanical gardens in Pisa. But it wasn't yet on tables.

""There was a lot of bias against the tomato,"" says Del Soldato.

""Tomato was perceived as a cold fruit, and coldness was considered a bad quality for a food because of the supremacy of Galenic medicine [following the ancient Greek doctor Galen.]

""It was associated with eggplant -- another vegetable with a bad rap. It was cultivated close to the dirt -- another factor that didn't make it palatable.

""Today we have the sense that if something is new it is good, but for a long time in history, being a novelty was mostly regarded with suspicion.""

Diego Zancani, emeritus professor of medieval and modern languages at Oxford University and author of ""How We Fell in Love with Italian Food,"" agrees.

""It was seen as an interesting fruit but potentially dangerous, so they didn't dream of using it as a food,"" he says.

""Not until medics discoved that if you had a skin ailment and took an unripe tomato and passed it over your skin, the ailment improved -- presumably the effect of vitamin C.""

The earliest recipe for tomato sauce was published in 1694, by Neapolitan chef Antonio Latini in his book ""Lo Scalco alla Moderna"" -- ""The Modern Steward.""

""It mentions that if you mix onions, tomatoes and some herbs you get a very interesting sauce that can be used in all sorts of things on meat, especially boiled meat -- and things that aren't so tasty become more interesting with the acidity of the tomato,"" says Zancani.

Not that it was considered a luxury.

""It was something for the rich as long as it was a botanical curiosity,"" says Del Soldato.

""It was something to admire, to brag about because you're one of the few people to display this rare plant from overseas, but tomatoes weren't part of the diet of the rich.

""On the contrary, rich people's diets were mostly meat- and protein-based, and there was an association between eating fruit and vegetables, and being poor.

""In many ways, people would have started eating tomatoes because there was nothing else available."" Tomato was a great food for poor people because they could not only eat all of it, but could preserve and store it, she says.

So how did it take over the world? From Naples, tomato-eating gradually spread over the Spanish-dominant parts of Italy, and then beyond says Del Soldato -- although you'll still find less tomato in northern regions.

By the 19th century, says Zancani, people were teaming them with pasta -- maccheroni with tomato sauce probably came in the middle of the 19th century, he reckons -- as well as mixing them with beans and other foods.

Del Soldato says that people in her region, Tuscany, took quickly to tomato and adapted it to their ""cucina povera"" (poor people's food).

""Tuscan cuisine is based on not wasting anything, so if you have leftover meat, you cook it the following day with tomato -- giving it more flavor with the tomato sauce. I think this obsession with not wasting food is very typical of Italian culture,"" she says, pointing out braciole rifatte -- breaded meat stewed in a tomato sauce -- as the perfect example.

And as agriculture became a science, the Italians started creating different varieties of tomato.

Today, where in many countries ""tomatoes"" just means ""tomatoes,"" go to Italy and you'll be assailed by a choice of myriad varieties. Some are best in salads, and some best used in cooking. That's where the San Marzano variety comes in -- that long, easy-peeling plum tomato, hailing from the sunny Naples and Salerno area of Campania, that top pizzerias shout from the rooftops.

Mechanization saw Italy's tomato scene go global. Dino Fracchia/Alamy

It's mechanization and modernization that catapulted the tomato into the global consciousness. When canning goods came into fashion across the world, tomatoes really took off.

Zancani says that in the 1800s, American entrepreneurs were tinning tomatoes and exporting them back to Europe. But it was only after World War II that they were produced on a mass scale. The marshy land around the Po Valley, in the north, was quickly judged suitable for tomato-growing, he says, adding that the area around Parma, Modena and Piacenza is still Italy's tomato hub today.

The Italian obsession

Of course, other nations make major use of the tomato -- it's a staple of Mediterranean diets, for starters -- but Italy's obsession is particular.

Ask an Italian, and they'll immediately tell you their favorite type of tomato. For Zancani, it's the cuore di bue (""ox's heart"") -- an enormous, meaty salad tomato known for its lack of water.

For Del Soldato -- who goes out of her way in Philadelphia to buy canned tomatoes and passata from Italy -- it's the squished, multiple-folded pomodoro fiorentino, which Tuscans use with onions, eggs and basil in a dish called fricassea. Luckily, she says, Delaware grows ""brandywine"" tomatoes which remind her of the fiorentino.

And for Paolo Gramaglia it is, of course, the San Marzano, which he claims has a rare umami taste.

""The secret of a great spaghetti al pomodoro is to look at it for 10 to 15 seconds,"" he says. ""That way, it goes first to your brain, then your soul, and then your mouth. And it has a calming effect.""

A good spaghetti al pomodoro, he says, sees ""the tomato making love to the spaghetti."" Simple as it is, he loves the dish so much that he says, he ""can't not serve it"" -- even in his Michelin-starred restaurant, and has turned the dish into an amuse bouche -- ""a forkful of spaghetti impregnated with tomato.""",
Labuan Bajo and beyond: Exploring the beauty of Indonesia's dragon archipelago,"Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy

(CNN) — Manta rays hover, wings pulsing, on the fast currents of the Flores Sea. Komodo dragons, earth's largest lizard, skulk in the scrubby forests of Komodo and Rinca. A peachy sunrise illuminates the rugged flanks and slender spine of Padar Island.

It's little surprise to anyone who has visited Komodo National Park, a flurry of volcanically upthrust islands and coral reef off the coast of Indonesia's Flores island, that it holds UNESCO World Heritage status.

Labuan Bajo, a bustling port town on Flores' northwestern tip, is best known as the jump off for Komodo National Park. It's where travelers will find Komodo Airport, which opened a new, modern terminal in 2015.

Set to host the G20 gathering of world leaders in 2022 and the ASEAN Summit in 2023, this region most associated with liveaboard dive boats and leisurely cruises on phinisi sailing ships is further developing in preparation for the global spotlight.

Here's a look at what travelers heading to Labuan Bajo and beyond can experience when the country reopens to international tourism.

Labuan Bajo: More than a port

The name ""Labuan Bajo"" means ""Place Where the Sea Gypsies Stop Over"", but the town is more than just a stopping place to book a cruise or stock up on pearls and abalone shells.

Labuan Bajo has accommodation for all budgets, ranging from private island beach bungalows to branded beachfront hotels, homestays and boutiques, with a wealth of hotels now under construction ahead of 2022.

While seafood feasts await and a couple of beach clubs deck the shores, the town's main attractions are natural, says Sebastian Pandang, head of the local branch of the Indonesian Tourist Guides Association.

""When I do city tours, I take travelers to Bukit Cinta, Batu Cermin, Gua Rangko and Cunca Wulang,"" he says.

Around the middle of the day, when light floods through the hillside entrance and illuminates the turquoise waters below, Gua Rangko, a marine cave accessible by boat near Labuan Bajo, is as stunning as Capri's famous Blue Grotto.

Meanwhile, about an hour away from Labuan Bajo, Cunca Wulang's cascades and natural water slides are photogenic fun for adults and kids alike.

Bukit Cinta offers sunset island views, while Batu Cermin cave -- just a 15-minute drive from the town -- features shining walls that reflect the sunlight.

Further afield on Flores

For travelers with time on their hands, it's worth exploring further afield in Flores. More than twice the size of Bali, this long, slender island is a place where rich tribal cultures occupy lush volcanic landscapes.

Perched in the sky, the conical thatched huts of the tribal village of Wae Rebo can be accessed only on foot. In Luba and Bena, an ancient matrilineal culture persists amid megalithic tombs and the skulls of sacrificed buffalo.

Traditional rituals and sports such as armed boxing endure throughout the island's lush green highlands, where women still weave ikat cloths and Flores coffee flourishes.

Further east, the volcano Kelimutu beckons, its summit capped with three dramatic crater lakes that gleam like slicks of oil paint in vivid mineral colors that change with the composition of the waters.

Each August, the local Lio people descend to the lakeside to leave offerings to their ancestors and honor them with dance.

Komodo Island: Here be dragons

Komodo dragons can reach lengths of 10 feet. Shutterstock

The island of Komodo is about a two-hour boat ride from Labuan Bajo. Its most popular attraction is its large population of Komodo dragons.

""In local legend, we believe that the Komodo dragon is born together with humans, from one mother,"" says Ishak, a ranger at the national park station on Komodo island who, like many Indonesians, uses just one name.

Over the centuries, the villagers of Komodo and nearby Rinca islands, where the bulk of the park's 5,000-odd lizards reside, have reached an equilibrium with these scaly predators -- although they typically graze their goats on islands out of the dragons' reach.

Despite their drooping jowls and lazy manner, Komodo dragons are powerful predators. Male dragons can reach a length of up to three meters (close to 10 feet) and take down prey as large as buffaloes with their strong jaws and potent venom.

Yet rangers escort visitors into their hunting grounds armed with nothing more dramatic than a forked stick, which they use in extremis to pinion the lizards' tails.

""The dragons haven't attacked a human being for (more than) two years,"" Ishak explains. ""And that was a Singaporean tourist who went for a walk without a ranger.""

Treks on Komodo island span the gamut from short strolls to nearby buildings where lazy lizards hang out in search of food, to half-day hikes into the surrounding forests where their more active cousins hunt deer, wild boar and more amid the calls of rare birds.

The heart of the Coral Triangle

Scuba aficionados have long prized Komodo National Park as one of Indonesia's standout diving destinations. It's set at the heart of the Coral Triangle , the world's epicenter of marine biodiversity, and is washed by turbulent currents that seed lush corals and draw large ocean-going creatures from sharks to mantas and even dolphins.

Liveaboard dive boats flock to sites like Batu Bolong, an oceanic pinnacle so rich in life that it's possible to see a turtle on one side of you and a reef shark on the other, and Manta Alley, where giant rays, some as much as five meters in wingspan, cluster to feed on plankton.

Yet you don't need to be a qualified diver to experience Komodo's underwater delights. Overnight, two-night and even one-day cruises let snorkelers discover pristine coral gardens, such as those at Manjarite or Pink Rock, or drift along the reef on fast currents, such as those near Karang Makassar.

Snorkelers can fin out in search of manta rays at sites like Manta Point, where the creatures circle over coral outcrops so smaller fish can clean them, or go in quest of the sea turtles that graze on Komodo's seagrass.

Island-hopping

Island-hopping is one of the great joys of any trip to Komodo National Park.

Padar, the park's third largest island after Komodo and Rinca, offers stunning sunrise views over sculpted ridges and sinuous bays from its slender spine, reached by hundreds of steps.

Kelor Island, a tiny cone decked with a pretty white sand beach, delivers 360-degree vistas of the volcanic outcrops that stud the Flores Sea.

For the perfect selfie, Karang Makassar, a low-lying white sand atoll surrounded by pale turquoise waters, is also magical.

And then there's Pink Rock, a volcanic outcrop that offers a surreal background of pink rock marbled in orange and yellow and threaded with veins of iron ore.

Yet, even more than white sands, Komodo National Park is famous for pink beaches. Scarlet coral fragments tint pale sands around the waterlines on several islands, creating a natural rainbow of beige, pink and turquoise.",
"She's the first female tour guide in Afghanistan, but she's determined not to be the last","(CNN) — For many people who work as tour guides, showing people around a new city involves a little bit of getting off the beaten track. But when there is no track at all, you just have to blaze one yourself.

That has been the story of Fatima, the only woman working as a tour guide in Afghanistan. The 22-year-old (who asked that CNN not use her surname for safety reasons) grew up leading sheep through the countryside, and now she leads tourists through the streets of Herat, the third-largest city in Afghanistan.

The making of a trailblazer

The youngest of eight children, Fatima is the only one of her siblings to be unmarried and to have gotten an education.

She grew up in rural Gohr Province, where she says there was no schooling available to girls, but she convinced her family to let her take lessons if she brought in enough of an income from sheep herding.

When Fatima was nine, her family settled in Herat. Though she was able to get some informal education, she mostly stayed at home helping her mother. Getting an education wasn't as simple as just enrolling in the local comprehensive.

When Fatima couldn't afford notebooks, she says she wrote with a stick in the sand. She practiced her English by listening to BBC radio, which she could pick up when high enough in the hills.

Unlike some kids, Fatima didn't grow up dreaming of working in tourism -- not only was it not traditional for women to work, she says she didn't even know that giving tours was a job.

""I thought a lot during these years, how sitting at home would not solve any problem,"" she says. ""My brothers and sisters were forced to get married. It was so sad for me. I decided that I would not continue in their tradition. That was how I decided to work.""

First step: work on her English. Fatima signed up for Facebook and began joining groups for people interested in history. Tired of people who only knew Afghanistan as a place of war and conflict, she says she started writing regular posts about places in her country that foreigners might not know about.

Herat is in northwestern Afghanistan, not far from the borders with Iran and Turkmenistan and has been inhabited since the fifth century BCE, making it an interesting place for a history buff to grow up.

After she began writing her posts, everything changed.

Fatima says started getting comments and responses from her new online friends. In 2020, one of them -- a man known as ""Big Tom"" -- reached out to her saying he was going to be traveling in Afghanistan and would she be interested in showing him around in Herat?

She said yes. They went to the Herat Citadel, to the National Museum and to a traditional tea house.

Tom recommended her to someone else, and Fatima continued to get work by word of mouth. Eventually she came to the attention of Untamed Borders , a boutique travel agency that specializes in trips to more inaccessible areas.

After meeting Fatima and traveling through the city with her, Tom recommended that the company hire her. And they did hire her in late 2020, which is how the young self-taught woman became her country's first female professional tour guide.

""Having a female guide gives our guests a whole new perspective,"" says James Willcox, Untamed Borders' founder. ""As well as being well informed as a guide, Fatima gives our guests a personal insight into her life as an Afghan woman. We try to give our guests a framework of information to give context to the experiences they have in Afghanistan, and Fatima adds to that in a big way.""

""In the future I want to write about girls like my sisters,"" says Fatima. Courtesy Untamed Borders

Fatima's new career caused some friction in her traditional family at a time when her siblings were already challenging their father's more conservative views.

She asserted her independence, telling her father: ""Right now, my brothers and sisters [say] that if we are not satisfied in life it is because of you. If I have a bad life now, it's because of me.""

Though he has come around to Fatima's work, she says her mother has always given her blessing. ""My mother is happy. She is supporting me. Right now, she is my everything.""

The rocky road smoothens out

Of course, being a pioneer is never easy.

Fatima says many people in her life, including some of her own family members, have told her that it's too dangerous for a woman to work, especially if it means interacting with men one-on-one.

She says children have thrown stones at her while she's guiding tourists through the local market. People have shouted profanities at her.

Sadly, these are not isolated experiences. According to data from the United Nations, only about 19% of women in Afghanistan are employed outside of the home.

The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women , more commonly known as UN Women, elucidates: ""About 64%t of Afghans agree that women should be allowed to work outside the home, however, they still face a multitude of barriers, including restrictions, harassment, discrimination and violence, as well as practical hurdles such as a lack of job experience, employment skills and education.""

Fatima says that the support of her employers and the people she has met through giving tours are what keep her motivated. There's also the implication of what could happen if she does quit: ""Challenges are always a part of my life. If I give up, then other women will never start.""

To keep herself safe, she dresses modestly while on the job and never goes out with a group late at night.

Afghanistan's tourism industry peaked in the relatively safe 1970s, with an average of 90,000 foreign tourists coming per year. Data is spotty and inconsistent, but in 2013 the country's deputy minister of tourism told the New York Times that the number was closer to 15-20,000 per year.

Many countries, including the United States, have travel advisories in place and encourage their citizens not to visit Afghanistan.

However, choosing which countries to visit and how can make a significant difference on the ground. Tourism is an industry where not everyone is required to have a college degree, which can make the bar of entry lower and easier.

Fatima's tour guide income helps to support her family, and it also means she can afford to go to college. After passing the entrance exams, Fatima says she's been able to enroll at Herat University and is now studying journalism. On the side, she says she teaches English to 41 girls in a refugee school.

The education, she says, isn't just for her. Fatima tutors her nieces and nephews in English and helps pay for some of their school fees and supplies. This is generational change in action -- the sons and daughters of siblings who could not get an education are now going to government schools.

If travel, in its purest form, is about expanding our view of the world around us, this is certainly true for Fatima, even when she is the one showing people her homeland instead of visiting theirs.

She says she dreams of changing roles for a while and letting someone else guide her -- her top choice for a travel destination, fitting for a lover of history and culture, is Tibet.

Most of Fatima's dreams, though, are closer to home. She says she hopes to open a school to train tour guides. It would be open to both boys and girls, she says, but ""ladies first,"" as there are fewer job opportunities available to women.",
Hong Kong Star Ferry converted into a luxury yacht,"Hong Kong (CNN) — The Star Ferry is one of Hong Kong 's most affordable attractions. But the Star Ferry yacht is another story.

The iconic boats, which transport locals and tourists alike between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, have long been one of the city's most famous symbols -- and popular photo ops.

Only one of these ferries has ever been sold into private hands, and it has since been converted into a yacht. That yacht is now up for sale , giving the general public a look at what became of this beloved vessel.

Named Golden Star, it went up for sale in 2011 after one of the city's cross-harbor ferry lines (between the neighborhoods of Hung Hom and Wan Chai) was discontinued amid expansion of the MTR subway.

The man who bought it -- he does not wish to reveal his name and uses an intermediary to respond to the press -- is reportedly a Hong Kong native who had a deep, nostalgic connection to the ferry system. He worked in Hung Hom and regularly commuted via Star Ferry.

Under his decade of ownership, the ship (known as DOT) was converted into a floating mansion with 6,000 square feet of living space. That space includes four state rooms, offices, an on-board movie theater, a formal dining room, rooftop spots for sunbathing and a living room that is reportedly home to Hong Kong's single biggest sofa. There's also space for a 14-foot-tall Christmas tree every year.

DOT runs on solar power (yes, those are solar panels on the top) and harnesses waste water, making it fully self-sufficient. There's also air conditioning, which anyone who has suffered through a humid Hong Kong summer will appreciate.

Transport fans will notice another significant change on DOT -- its color.

Star Ferries in Hong Kong are generally painted white on the upper deck and dark green on the lower. This wasn't a purely aesthetic decision. After World War II, the British army still had a surplus of dark-green paint left over, so it was used on many public works projects throughout the city -- including ferries and, later, trams.

These days, DOT is all-white, but it's hard to miss the familiar shape of the boat against Hong Kong's turquoise waters.

DOT is priced at $21 million HK ($2.7 million USD) via Ocean Independence

Star Ferry's long history

The 120-year-old Star Ferry is Hong Kong's oldest form of public transport. The origins of this commuter service can be traced back to one man.

The first Star Ferry service across Victoria Harbour began in 1888, and the ride took between 40 and 60 minutes depending on water conditions.

These days, thanks to a combination of more modern boats and more reclaimed land shrinking the size of the harbor, a trip on the Star Ferry takes just a few minutes. But those few minutes are all you need to take in some of the city's beautiful waterfront architecture, and even the most jaded commuter finds themselves gazing at the harbor sunset.

When these regular ferries began running, it was the first instance of regular, regulated transport between the island and the peninsula. Travelers could hail private boats (kaitos, a low-fi version of water taxis), but there was no consistency or ability to plan a trip in advance.

Hong Kong's public trams -- nicknamed ""ding dings"" for the sound of the clanging signal they make -- would not start until 1904, and the MTR subway system unveiled its first stations in the 1970s.

All boats in the Star Ferry fleet have the word ""Star"" in their name. There are two remaining routes -- between Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) at the southern tip of Kowloon and Central Piers on Hong Kong Island, and between TST and Wan Chai. The three neighborhoods are home to a large percentage of Hong Kong's hotels, meaning that a ride on the ferry is both scenic and convenient.",
'We were the only airplanes in the sky' -- the surreal lives of Covid-era pilots,"(CNN) — Darrell Myers remembers the surreal feeling last March when nearly all passenger travel shut down, leaving cargo pilots like him flying all alone.

""We saw the devastation hit the airline industry,"" said Myers, the president of the Luxembourg Airline Pilots Association, who is a captain for Cargolux. ""There were moments where my company, we were the only airplanes in the sky.""

Like many essential workers, international pilots have had to adjust to a drastically different work environment over the past 12 months.

As the pandemic caused the sharpest air traffic decline in history, airlines were forced to lay off or furlough nearly half of all pilots, according to a recent survey from Goose Recruitment and FlightGlobal.

Those still flying can face sharply reduced flight schedules, regular Covid-19 testing and isolating layovers confined in hotel rooms.

First Officer Jason Voudri was in the middle of switching employers when Covid-19 struck and he found himself grounded for several months.

When he finally received the call to fly again, he needed refresher training on a simulator before he could start flying for Air Senegal.

Back in the air since January 8, he knows he's among the lucky ones, saying he's ""just grateful to be among the pilots who actually have a job right now.""

Coping mechanisms

Voudri's routine as a commercial pilot now includes a mandatory temperature check when arriving at the airport and filling in a form to attest he is free of Covid-19 symptoms.

He wipes down thrust levers, knobs, and switches in the cockpit when taking over from another crew. The flights his airline used to fly daily now only run three days a week.

They've also grouped some destinations together, turning once nonstop flights into connecting ones.

Pilots who regularly fly between countries face a wide spectrum of rules regarding testing, layovers and rest time, determined by national governments that are trying to balance health and safety concerns with the need to facilitate necessary passenger and cargo travel.

Some countries exempt pilots from testing requirements and quarantine, as long as they obey local mask and social distancing rules, while others require they stay confined to a hotel or even inside an individual hotel room on layover.

Captain Myers sometimes gets tested more than once a day for Covid-19. He jokes he is so used to the nasal swab he now lets the person administering the test ""surprise"" him by choosing the left or right nostril.

As for the hotel lockdowns, Myers said pilots have different coping mechanisms for the isolation. Technology, especially video calls, are a big help.

""I sometimes take a guitar with me on trips. You learn to adapt to it. But I think in the long term we [will] start to see that people are impacted by it,"" he said.

Extended isolation

Hong Kong introduced the world's strictest policies towards air crews last month, requiring them to quarantine in a hotel room for 14-days.

FedEx said in an internal memo that it would offer relocation to its air crews as a result of that policy, saying the quarantines would lead to ""extended periods of isolation"" and time away from their families.

Taiwan and some states in Australia have all tightened quarantine rules for flights crews over the past few months, after specific incidents. The International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations warns that such ""complete lockdown may have detrimental effects on mental health.""

Meidan Barr, chairman of the Israel Airline Pilots Association, believes the current system is not one that will support post-pandemic recovery. He wants a global standard to be established.

""Most of us are vaccinated, but we're still tested and go back to a hotel with no room key, sometimes without a window, getting some cold food outside your door, not able to walk or even to do some work out,"" said Barr.

While most Israel pilots are vaccinated, flight crews in much of the rest of the world are still waiting. Several organizations that represent pilots, including the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations, the International Transport Workers' Federation and major US unions have urged governments to give flight crews priority access to vaccines.

Myers doesn't want his colleagues at the back of the vaccine line, but he hopes they are not pressed into mandatory vaccinations either. Like Barr, mostly he is advocating for consistency, saying the current ""kaleidoscope"" of recommendations will only make it more challenging for the industry to recover.",
"These American expats are willing to travel more than 5,000 miles for their shots","(CNN) — Eric Barry has been riding a seemingly never-ending wave of uncertainty in his life over the past year.

The 35-year-old writer and podcast host, who is originally from California's Bay Area, was researching a novel in Ecuador when the global pandemic erupted in March 2020.

Over the next 12 months, as Barry tried to establish his new home base in Berlin, where he's studying for a master's degree, he faced challenge after challenge: an apartment that fell through in Berlin's notoriously difficult rental market; trying to track down a German residence permit likely mailed to his former address; and navigating an unfamiliar healthcare system in which he has no idea when he'll be vaccinated.

Now, Barry is headed back to the United States for something he does have control over: getting his Covid-19 shot in the near future. Hearing a fellow expat's plans a few weeks ago to travel to the US for her own vaccination ""planted a seed,"" he says.

""And then on a Facebook group I started seeing wave after wave of Americans that were all traveling back, and I thought, maybe this is something I want to do,"" Barry says while waiting in a Starbucks before the first of a three-flight, 30-plus-hour journey to California, where he plans to stay with his already-vaccinated mom.

""I never thought that, as I was leaving the United States for Germany, with this promise of a life with a better healthcare system, less than a year later I'd be traveling back to the US for healthcare.""

That seems to be a growing sentiment among Americans living overseas -- especially those in Europe frustrated by a vaccine rollout that the World Health Organization slammed in a recent report as ""unacceptably slow.""

Just 10% of Europe's population has currently received the first shot in a two-dose regimen, and many countries, including Germany and France, are in strict lockdown.

'We both felt so much relief'

It's quite a different scene across the Atlantic as more and more US states continue to open up vaccines to all adults over 16, with ""I Got the Shot"" stickers and vaccine selfies proliferating on social media.

The United States continues to set records for numbers of daily doses administered, and President Joe Biden has pledged that by the end of May -- a target that has been moved up by two months -- the US will have enough vaccine for any adult who wants one.

Some Americans abroad want in on the action, too.

Spokespersons from the US Department of State and the US Customs and Border Protection told CNN via e-mail that they do not keep track of data on US citizens who live overseas coming back for their vaccines.

But it's a safe bet that there are more than a few doing just that on half-full flights into the US, whose borders mostly remain closed except to US citizens.

Mindy Chung, her husband, and their young son were recently among them. Chung and her husband decided earlier this year to fly from Berlin, where they live, to their home state of California after her doctor in Germany told her she wouldn't be able to get the vaccine anytime soon, despite her underlying health conditions.

""That was a moment of like, yeah, we can't stay,"" Chung says.

A few days after landing in California about a week ago, Chung and her husband secured appointments.

""As soon as we got through the process of checking in and got our shot, we both felt so much relief that we had another layer of protection,"" Chung says.

Meanwhile, online American expat groups are buzzing with posts about travel restrictions and border closures and which states are stringent about showing proof of residency. Others share on-the-ground updates about how the process went.

'There's no right answer'

Unsurprisingly, there can be backlash, too, both online and in real life.

""There sometimes is the sense that, now that you live here, this is part of the package,"" says Austin Langlois, a former digital nomad who moved to Amsterdam for a full-time communications job in the spring of 2020. ""It's this feeling I kind of get, like, it's a cop-out to go to the States to get your vaccination, to get it faster.""

Langlois's range of eligibility for a shot in the Netherlands stretches into the fall, which is ""a long time away,"" says Langlois, who's originally from Michigan.

""My perspective is that it shouldn't be a debate on what [vaccine] you're getting or where you're getting it. Everyone should get it as soon as they can, where they can, because that will support the collective health of our society.""

That said, while Langlois is considering traveling back to the US this spring, he hasn't bought a ticket yet. He remains hopeful that the Netherlands will speed up its vaccine program and wants to be ""respectful"" of current travel advisories. He's also keeping an eye on the still-tenuous situation in the United States.

""We're encroaching on a third wave in the US, so you do have a bit of that dilemma as well,"" Langlois says. ""Do you travel and put yourself and others at risk to get your vaccination earlier, or do you wait to get your vaccination here, which is who knows when? There's no right answer, and there's no clear answer.""

'Taking some control back'

For American expats with health conditions, the decision takes on another level of complexity. Ali Garland, a travel blogger based in Berlin, says even though she has an autoimmune disease that puts her in a higher priority group, it's unclear when her shots would actually happen, and the timeline for her husband could reach into 2022.

The risks and hassles of the trip itself -- flying with their new puppy, finding short-term housing in the US -- also are daunting. So Garland and her husband remain in an angsty ""wait and see"" mode.

""A big part of why I'm considering going back to the US is control,"" Garland told CNN via email. ""The past year has felt like a complete lack of control over my own life. So it feels like everything was taken away from me, and considering going to the US to get vaccinated potentially months ahead of here would feel like taking some control back into my own hands.""

Eileen Cho, a Paris-based freelance writer and photographer originally from Seattle, can relate. Cho spent three months with family in the United States before returning to France in March -- and into yet another lockdown.

Cho has heard alarming reports of other expats having their residence cards confiscated at the French border. That makes her hesitant to go back to the US for a vaccine, only to be barred from re-entering France, where she's lived for six years and now considers home.

Still, Cho, who says she has severe asthma, says if the situation doesn't improve by around June, she just might hop on a US-bound plane for her vaccine.",
Exclusive look inside the US supersonic presidential jet,"(CNN) — The news broke last September that a California start-up was working with the US Air Force on developing a supersonic plane which could be used as Air Force One

Exosonic was handed a contract by the Presidential and Executive Airlift Directorate (PE) after impressing the military with its concept for a low-boom supersonic Mach 1.8 twinjet.

Now CNN Travel has had an exclusive look inside the cabin interior of the executive transport plane designed to carry the US Executive Branch's distinguished visitors (DVs).

It's a 31-passenger derivative of Exosonic's 70-passenger commercial airliner concept and is the ultimate in business jets -- luxury leather, oak and quartz fittings, private suites for work and rest, and all at cruise times twice that of existing aircraft.

The functions of presidential craft varies according to need, but this plane might primarily be used as Air Force Two, which is the call sign for jets carrying the US vice president.

New technologies

""With this concept we are planning to implement new technologies that are not available today or that you don't (yet) see on commercial or business aircraft,"" says Stephanie Chahan, Exosonic's principal aircraft interior designer, as she leads CNN on a virtual walk-through.

The first of two private suites is the three-passenger meeting room, with secure video teleconferencing so distinguished visitors can work, go online, or address the press.

The rotatable seats are leather with wooden shells and the video monitor is capable of being stored in a rolled position so there is space on the credenza sideboard for food platters or presentation equipment.

""So whether they're flying the vice president or the first lady, or the first gentleman, we'd have a lot of flexibility here,"" says Chahan.

Low-booom supersonic flight

The second eight-passenger suite has lie-flat seats and adjustable table heights and it's where senior staffers can work collaboratively and rest.

Then there's the main cabin with 20 business-class seats, plus two galleys, two lavatories and plenty of stowage space.

Following the trend in modern aircraft design, the seatbacks have spaces for holding personal electronic devices rather than traditional seat-back monitors.

""The cabin design was inspired by the US Executive Branch and its mission and values, as well as the peregrine falcon, renowned for its speed -- both by its movement and by its beautiful look,"" says Chahan.

Exosonic's plane boasts a 5,000-nautical-mile range and, thanks to boom-softening techniques, it should be able to fly overland at almost twice the speed of sound without upsetting residents down below.

""The future for global rapid passenger travel is low-boom supersonic flight,"" says Exosonic's CEO, Norris Tie. ""Low boom allows travelers to fly at supersonic speeds without generating disruptive booms for those on the ground.""

Mach 1.8 is around 1,381 miles per hour (2,222 kilometers), which is more than twice the typical cruising speed of a long-distance commercial craft.

Tie tells CNN that the company expects its supersonic plane to be flying by the mid-2030s.

USAF investments

Exosonic isn't the only aviation trailblazer to receive investment from the US Air Force.

Atlanta-based Hermeus Corporation is working on a hypersonic 20-seater that promises to deliver passengers from New York to London in 90 minutes.

Last year, it partnered with the US Air Force and PE to develop its Mach 5 craft in order to support the presidential and executive fleet, and this March Hermeus announced that it was teaming up with NASA too.",
Ancient mummies to parade through streets of Cairo,"(CNN) — Ancient mummies of Egypt's royal pharaohs will emerge from their resting places this weekend and parade through the streets of Cairo in search of a new home.

What sounds like the plot of a movie is in fact part of a lavish celebration of Egypt's history and a project to relocate some of its greatest treasures to a new high tech facility.

On Saturday, the mummies of Ramses the Great and 21 of his fellow pharaohs will take part in what is being billed as ""The Pharaoh's Golden Parade,"" a highly anticipated event organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.

It's reported that the celebrations will include horse-drawn chariots, choirs singing in ancient languages and a plethora of movie stars and dignitaries, but Egyptian authorities have kept official details of the event under lock and key.

""It is a surprise,"" Ahmed Ghoneim, executive director of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, the institution which will be the final resting place for the mummies, tells CNN.

Nevertheless, it's hard to keep an event of this magnitude a surprise, especially when dress rehearsals recently took place in the center of Cairo. Excited Egyptians snapped photos of custom-made mummy vehicles adorned with golden ancient motifs and hastily uploaded them to social media.

The final move

The aim of the parade is to move the 18 kings and four queens of Egypt, along with their coffins and belongings, from their old home at The Egyptian Museum.

They'll be transported five kilometers (three miles) south, to their new high-tech resting place at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC).

No, not the vast Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza which is also due to open to the public later this year. The NMEC is a completely different museum in Cairo's Fustat neighborhood that will complete a trio of must-see Egyptian-themed museums in and around Cairo.

Although the NMEC had a partial opening in 2017, the parade will signify the grand opening.

""It's a presidential opening,"" says Ghoneim. And the completion of the Hall of Royal Mummies which looks to be a unique museum experience.

""The whole idea is not the mummies, the whole idea is how you display the mummies... It's how you tell the story, it's the environment, it's the ambiance that you feel when you're getting in,"" he adds.

Ghoneim says visitors entering the Hall of Royal Mummies will experience something akin to entering a tomb in the Valley of the Kings.

All 22 royal mummies are from the New Kingdom, an era where tombs were built underground with hidden entrances to ward off grave robbers. A world apart, and about 600 years, from their flamboyant Old Kingdom royal counterparts who built colossal pyramid tombs.

Preparing the mummies

A virtual tour of King Tutankhamun's tomb, buried in the Valley of the Kings, near Luxor, Egypt.

Dr. Mostafa Ismail, head of conservation at the Mummies Conservation Lab and Storeroom at the NMEC, led a team of 48 people to prepare the royal mummies.

The conservation process, he tells CNN, involves placing each mummy in an oxygen-free, nitrogen capsule ""which can keep it preserved without being damaged from the effects of humidity, especially we're talking about bacteria, fungi, and insects.""

The capsule is surrounded by soft material that distributes pressure and reduces vibrations during transportation.

When the mummies arrive at the NMEC, the display units will have the exact same conditions as the nitrogen capsules. ""So there will not be any shock for the mummy when we take it from the box and put it in these units,"" Ismail adds.

Accompanying each mummy will be any belongings discovered alongside them, including their coffins.

Displays will also show CT scans which reveal what is beneath the wraps, and sometimes any breaks in bones or diseases that afflicted the royals.

""The main thing that we want the visitors to know about these mummies, is how they have been mummified and preserved for a long time.""

When asked if his team discovered anything new about the mummies in preparing them for the move, Ismail remarked: ""a lot of things,"" but none that he would reveal before the parade. So there are more surprises to come.

A new cultural hub in Cairo

Undoubtedly the Hall of Royal Mummies will be the star attraction for visitors to The National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, but Executive Director Ahmed Ghoneim hopes to position the museum differently to its neighboring institutions.

""I'm not focusing on the Pharaonic era as most people would think,"" he says. ""Most Egyptians and non-Egyptians, whenever they go to an Egyptian museum then they think they're going to see the pharaohs.

""Here I'm setting myself differently, I'm telling a different story, going across history and coming to the present.""

The first temporary exhibition will focus on Egyptian textiles and fashion. ""All of the history from carpets to clothing"" says Ghoneim.

Through the exhibits the museum will tell a richer story of the achievements of Egyptian civilization but the museum will also be a cultural hub.

""A place that offers everything, part educational, part cultural, part amusement, part night time dining place, and so on. It's something that's unique.""

And at last, 3,234 years after his death, Rameses II may finally be laid to rest.",
Easter dishes from around the world,"(CNN) — Honey-glazed ham, garlic mashed potatoes and fluffy dinner rolls might be staples at American Easter meals, but around the world, there are many distinct ways to savor the holiday -- ones that incorporate both local ingredients and unique cultural traditions.

""Italians go all out,"" said Judy Witts Francini, creator of the Italian food blog Divina Cucina . She's from California but has lived in Florence and Tuscany for decades.

Witts Francini's Easter lunch starts with an assortment of antipasti. For the first course, she serves a savory tart called torta pasqualina , which has 33 layers of phyllo dough to symbolize the 33 years of Christ's life. The second course includes roast lamb, fried artichokes, peas with pancetta and roasted potatoes. Dessert is chocolate eggs (which can be up to 3 feet tall) with a gift inside and a dove-shaped cake, called colomba.

And that's just lunch.

l e v a r t

Other countries take a similar ""more is more"" approach to Easter meals, but a few dishes really stand out. Here are just five.

Italy: Pizza rustica

Stuffed with meat and cheese, Italian pizza rustica is served at room temperature on Easter Sunday. Rossella Rago

Before you roll your eyes at the mere mention of this circular classic, know that the pizza Italians crave on Easter bears little resemblance to what you find on most US delivery menus.

Pizza rustica, also known as pizzagaina, is stuffed with meat and cheese and enclosed in a flaky crust. Like most Italian recipes, pizza rustica varies from region to region, town to town and chef to chef. It originally comes from Naples, which is known as the birthplace of pizza.

""It's basically a ricotta cheesecake, but it's super savory -- to the max,"" said Rossella Rago, an Italian American author and host of the popular online cooking show "" Cooking with Nonna "" who wrote a cookbook with the same name.

To make the pie, first, you need to make the pastry dough, which includes flour, eggs, salt, milk and lard.

""Everybody always asks me, 'Can I make this with shortening?' And the answer is always: 'No,'"" Rago said. ""If it's any other time of year, I will say, 'Yes, fine, use shortening,' but when it's actually Easter you have got to use lard.""

Inside, the pizza -- at least Rago's version -- contains ricotta, provolone, mozzarella, soppressata (an Italian dry salami), prosciutto, eggs and more.

""Everybody has their own combination that they swear by. If you want Italian people to fight right now, ask them, 'What's the real pizzagaina?' That's what everybody is obsessed with in Italian America,"" Rago said. ""It makes me laugh every single time, because there is no right way. It's ridiculous to think that.

""Italy had 600 languages until its unification,"" Rago added. ""So, you think we have one recipe for anything, absolutely not.""

Nonna Romana holds scarcella, a braided Easter bread decorated with colorful hard-boiled eggs. Her granddaughter, Rossella Rago, said Romana made them every Easter for all the kids. Rossella Rago

Rago's recipe is from her grandma, Nonna Romana, and is a true Italian American story. Romana is from Puglia, a region in southern Italy where they don't make the dish. She learned about it from other Italian Americans while she was working at a clothing factory in Brooklyn, New York. She took their version and made some additions and subtractions. After years and years of tweaks, she created her own Italian American tradition.

""She swears it's the best,"" Rago said. Her secret is extra-sharp provolone. Rago said it's one of the most popular dishes on her website, and everyone who tries it says they have success their first try.

Traditionally, this dish is made on Good Friday and served at room temperature on Easter Sunday.

Mexico: Capirotada

When you think of authentic Mexican cuisine, there are many things that come to mind: rice, beans and tortillas, to name a few.

Now, you can add capirotada to the list.

Capirotada is a Mexican dessert that's similar to bread pudding. It's made from bread drenched in syrup and layered among nuts, cheese, fruit and sometimes sprinkles.

""If you are into salty, sweet, soft, crunchy, spongy mixed all together with a dash of spice, this is for you,"" said Mely Martinez, creator of the blog Mexico in My Kitchen . ""Yes, this concoction sounds really weird, but it is an explosion of flavors in your mouth.""

Martinez was born and raised in Tampico, Mexico. She serves this dish for dessert every Easter.

cheese, roasted peanuts and raisins. It's baked and then topped with bananas and sprinkles. To make Martinez's traditional capirotada , layers of sliced white bread are baked with butter and then dipped in syrup made from piloncillo (an unrefined type of sugar), cinnamon and cloves. The bread is placed in a ovenproof dish between layers of cotijacheese, roasted peanuts and raisins. It's baked and then topped with bananas and sprinkles.

Capirotada is usually served at room temperature on Easter Sunday, but many serve it throughout Holy Week.

""It's addicting. Once you start eating it, you can't stop eating it,"" Martinez told CNN.

Brought to Mexico by the Spaniards, capirotada became popular in Mexico because it's easy to make and uses ingredients people have on hand.

It was originally a savory dish using beef broth, but evolved into today's sweet version using syrup, according to Martinez. Some believe the bread represents the body of Christ and the syrup represents his blood.

There are many variations of capirotada all over Mexico.

Charbel Barker's capirotada has evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk, additions to the recipe by her abuelita. Charbel Barker of My Latina Table

""My abuelita would always say, it's good but something is missing. It needs more sweetness,"" Barker said. So she added two types of milk: evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk.

Barker said the milk adds more flavor and creates a pudding-like texture.

""It tastes like a Snickers,"" Barker said.

Poland: Żurek

The savory Polish dish żurek, or sour rye soup, often is served with sausage and a boiled egg, along with horseradish for a spicy kick. Anna Hurning of Polish Your Kitchen

In Poland, a dish that takes center stage on Easter is żurek. It's a creamy and smoky fermented soup made from rye flour starter. This soup is often served with a boiled egg and sausage, and then garnished with spicy horseradish.

Anna Hurning, the creator of the blog Polish Your Kitchen, was born and raised in Poland and now lives in Szczecin in the northwest region. Anna Hurning of Polish Your Kitchen

Żurek is regarded as something of a national treasure in the Central European country.

""It's sour, tangy and meaty,"" said Anna Hurning, the creator of the blog Polish Your Kitchen . Hurning was born and raised in Poland and now lives in the city of Szczecin.

She makes żurek every Easter and serves it as an appetizer.

To make the soup, first, you need to make a rye starter : Mix flour and cold water with aromatics (including garlic, allspice, peppercorns, marjoram and bay leaves). Then, let it sit on your counter for several days to ferment. Hurning said this is how it gets its ""funky"" flavor. Don't be intimated by this step -- she said it's supereasy. You just let nature do the trick.

Next, the sour starter is boiled with the soup base. Hurning's version consists of bacon, carrots, parsnip and onion.

This soup is served all over the country year-round and on Easter with many variations. Some have it with sauerkraut and smoked goat cheese. Others add potatoes and wild mushrooms.

Singapore: Beef murtabak

The cuisine in Singapore is truly a mélange of cultures: Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian and Peranakan. Pinpointing dishes authentic to Singapore might seem like an impossible feat, but that's exactly the endeavor chef Damian D'Silva has chosen.

""If I don't do anything to preserve the cuisine of our heritage, one day it will all disappear,"" said D'Silva, the head chef at Restaurant Kin in Singapore. He has been cooking heritage cuisine professionally for more than 20 years.

""The cuisine is very unique. You can have one dish in Singapore, but you have five different ways of preparing it,"" he said. ""And no one is wrong because every ethnicity puts in their own story and ingredients.""

Chef Damian D'Silva makes heritage cuisine in Singapore. His menu at Restaurant Kin features Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian, and Peranakan classic dishes. Restaurant Kin

D'Silva grew up in Singapore, and one of his childhood favorites was beef murtabak. His granddad made it on Easter and served it after Mass -- marking the end of Lent. D'Silva remembers looking forward to the savory dish after going 40 days without meat.

""When Easter happened, it was a celebration and, of course when it's a celebration, the thing that comes to mind is meat,"" he said. ""We only ate beef on very, very special occasions.""

Beef murtabak is an egg crepe wrapped around ground beef. The beef is marinated in curry powder, then cooked with an onion and garlic paste and spices (star anise, cinnamon and nutmeg). The dish is served with fresh lime, chili sauce and raita.

""The aromatics are the one that lifts the entire dish and bring it to another level,"" D'Silva said.

D'Silva has tried to find the origin of the dish. But like many Singaporean dishes, it goes so far back that nobody knows where it started.

This Easter, D'Silva is making beef murtabak at Restaurant Kin to celebrate Singapore's heritage.

""Singapore is a lot more than chili crab and chicken rice. It's a lot, lot more than that,"" D'Silva said. ""If you have an opportunity to go to a restaurant that serves Singapore's heritage cuisine, go, because it's mind-blowing: the flavor, the ingredients. Everything about it.""

""It's spicy and delicious,"" she said.

Jollof contains long-grain rice and Nigerian-style curry powder for seasoning, and there are many ways to cook the dish that involve endless permutations of meat, spices, chiles, onions and vegetables.

Osinkolu's recipe, called The Party Style With Beef , comes from her mom. But Osinkolu added her own secret step: roasting the bell peppers, tomatoes, onion and garlic.

""At home, whenever we are having parties, we don't cook our jollof rice on the stovetop. We use open fire, so the jollof rice has a smoky taste, which makes it more delicious,"" Osinkolu said. ""So, I roast the bell peppers to achieve a similar, or very close, taste. It makes a lot of difference.""

This year, Osinkolu's Easter version will include goat meat and chicken. Her jollof is so popular that she now knows to always make extra for her guests to take home.",
We found your next spring baking project: Stanley Tucci's Easter bread,"The ""Searching for Italy"" host included a recipe for the seasonal baked good in his 2012 recipe collection, ""The Tucci Cookbook,"" and explains that it's a mainstay for his family every year.

""My grandmother Nonna Tucci baked this cake-like bread, decorated with eggs, every Easter,"" Tucci says. ""Now my cousin Maria Pia has taken over ... She knows just how soft and sticky the dough should feel to create a light, not-too-sweet bread, and she serves it along with other desserts and coffee. Leftovers are great for breakfast, too.""

In Italy, as in many countries , there's a tradition of baking sweet, enriched breads to celebrate the Easter holiday.

In the Tucci family, it's all about the anello di pasqua, or Easter ""ring,"" that's studded with whole eggs before it's placed in the oven.

If you want a festive look to your finished loaf, you can dye the raw eggs before placing them onto the dough; ""they bake along with the bread and can be removed from their shells and eaten just like hard-boiled eggs,"" Tucci explains. No food dye? No problem -- plain eggs will work just as well.

""When I was growing up, my other grandmother, Nonna Tropiano, or my aunt Angie would give us each one of these breads as an Easter gift,"" Tucci says in his book. ""We would carry them around, munching on the sweet dough for hours.""

We can't imagine a better way to eat this spring.

Maria Pia's Easter bread from 'The Tucci Cookbook'

Serves 10

Ingredients

9 large eggs, at room temperature

½ cup granulated sugar

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

4 cups all-purpose flour

½ teaspoon kosher salt

4 teaspoons baking powder

12 tablespoons (1½ sticks) butter, softened

1½ cups confectioners' sugar

2 tablespoons milk or water

½ teaspoon pure lemon extract

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350° F.

2. In a medium-size bowl, beat six of the eggs, the granulated sugar and the vanilla until pale yellow and frothy. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, stir together three cups of the flour, the salt, and the baking powder. Add the butter and blend with an electric mixer to form a crumbly mixture. Gradually beat in the egg mixture. Add up to ½ cup of the remaining flour to form a soft dough that is dry on the outside but still sticky on the inside.

4. Gently roll the dough into a log about 15 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Cut off a 1-inch-long piece of the dough and set aside. Place the log on a baking sheet. Bring the ends of the log together to form a circle, pinching the dough together to seal the ends. Press one of the remaining eggs into the dough at this joint. Place the other 2 eggs an even distance apart on either side of the joint, gently pressing them into the dough.

5. Roll the reserved dough into six ropes about ½ inch wide and 4 inches long. Place two ropes over each egg to form an X, or cross, pinching gently to seal the ends of the ropes to the bread dough. Bake until the bread is light golden brown and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.",
Casu marzu: The world's 'most dangerous' cheese,"(CNN) — The Italian island of Sardinia sits in the middle of the Tyrrhenian Sea, gazing at Italy from a distance. Surrounded by a 1,849-kilometer coastline of white sandy beaches and emerald waters, the island's inland landscape rapidly rises to form hills and impervious mountains.

And it is within these edgy curves that shepherds produce casu marzu, a maggot-infested cheese that, in 2009, the Guinness World Record proclaimed the world's most dangerous cheese.

Cheese skipper flies, Piophila casei, lay their eggs in cracks that form in cheese, usually fiore sardo, the island's salty pecorino.

Maggots hatch, making their way through the paste, digesting proteins in the process, and transforming the product into a soft creamy cheese.

Then the cheesemonger cracks open the top -- which is almost untouched by maggots -- to scoop out a spoonful of the creamy delicacy.

It's not a moment for the faint-hearted. At this point, the grubs inside begin to writhe frantically.

Some locals spin the cheese through a centrifuge to merge the maggots with the cheese. Others like it au naturel. They open their mouths and eat everything.

If you are able to overcome the understandable disgust, marzu has a flavor that is intense with reminders of the Mediterranean pastures and spicy with an aftertaste that stays for hours.

Some say it's an aphrodisiac. Others say that it could be dangerous for human health as maggots could survive the bite and and create myiasis, micro-perforations in the intestine, but so far, no such case has been linked to casu marzu.

The cheese is banned from commercial sale , but Sardinians have been eating it, jumping grubs included, for centuries.

""The maggot infestation is the spell and delight of this cheese,"" says Paolo Solinas, a 29-year-old Sardinian gastronome.

He says some Sardinians cringe at the thought of casu marzu, but others raised on a lifetime of salty pecorino unabashedly love its strong flavors.

""Some shepherds see the cheese as a unique personal pleasure, something that just a few elects can try,"" Solinas adds.

Archaic cuisine

It's illegal to sell or buy casu marzu. Giovanni Fancello

When tourists visit Sardinia, they usually wind up in a restaurant that serves porceddu sardo, a slowly roasted suckling piglet, visit bakers who sell pane carasau, a traditional paper-thin flatbread, and meet shepherds who produce fiore sardo, the island pecorino cheese.

Yet, if you are adventurous enough, it's possible to find the casu marzu. It shouldn't be seen as a weird attraction, but a product that keeps alive an ancient tradition and hints at what the future of food might look like.

Giovanni Fancello, a 77-year-old Sardinian journalist and gastronome, spent his life researching local food history. He's traced it back to a time when Sardinia was a province of the Roman empire.

""Latin was our language, and it's in our dialect that we find traces of our archaic cuisine,"" Fancello says.

The cheese can only be produced at certain times of year when the sheeps' milk is right. Alice Mastinu

There is no written record of Sardinian recipes until 1909, according to Fancello. That's when Vittorio Agnetti, a doctor from mainland Modena, traveled to Sardinia and compiled six recipes in a book called ""La nuova cucina delle specialità regionali.""

""But we have always eaten worms,"" says Fancello. ""Pliny the Elder and Aristotle talked about it.""

Ten other Italian regions have their variant of maggot-infested cheese, but while the products elsewhere are regarded as one-offs, casu marzu is intrinsically part of Sardinian food culture.

The cheese has several different names, such as casu becciu, casu fattittu, hasu muhidu, formaggio marcio. Each sub-region of the island has its own way of producing it using different kinds of milk.

'Magic and supernatural events'

Foodies inspired by the exploits of chefs such as Gordon Ramsay often come in search of the cheese, says Fancello. ""They ask us: 'How do you make casu marzu?' It's part of our history. We are the sons of this food. It's the result of chance, of magic and supernatural events.""

Fancello grew up in the town of Thiesi with his father Sebastiano, who was a shepherd who made casu marzu. Facello shepherded his family's sheep to grazing grounds around rural Monte Ruju, lost in the clouds, where magic was believed to happen.

He recalls that, for his father, casu marzu was a divine gift. If his cheeses didn't become infested with maggots, he would be desperate. Some of the cheese he produced stayed for the family, others went to friends or people who asked for it.

Casu Marzu is typically produced at the end of June when local sheep milk begins to change as the animals enter their reproductive time and the grass dries from the summer heat.

If a warm sirocco wind blows on the cheesemaking day, the cheese-transforming magic works even harder. Fancello says it's because the cheese has a weaker structure, making the fly's job easier.

After three months, the delicacy is ready.

Mario Murrocu, 66, keeps casu marzu traditions alive at his farm, Agriturismo Sa Mandra , near Alghero in the north of Sardinia. He also keeps 300 sheep and hosts guests in his trattoria, and keeps casu marzu traditions alive.

""You know when a form will become casu marzu,"" he says. ""You see it from the unusual spongy texture of the paste,"" Murrocu says.

Nowadays, this isn't so much down to luck as the ideal conditions that cheesemongers now use to ensure as many casu marzu as possible. They've also figured out a way to use glass jars to conserve the cheese, which traditionally never lasted beyond September, for years.

High fines

Though revered, the cheese's legal status is a gray area.

Casu marzu is registered as a traditional product of Sardinia and therefore is locally protected. Still, it has been deemed illegal by the Italian government since 1962 due to laws that prohibit the consumption of food infected by parasites.

Those who sell the cheese can face high fines up to €50,000 (about $60,000) but Sardinians laugh when asked about the prohibition of their beloved cheese.

In the past few years, the European Union has begun to study and revive the notion of eating grubs thanks to the concept of novel food , where insects are raised to be consumed.

Research shows that their consumption could help reduce carbon dioxide emissions associated with animal farming and help alleviate the climate crisis.

Roberto Flore, the Sardinian head of Skylab FoodLab , the food system change laboratory of the Technical University of Denmark's innovation hub, has long studied the concept of insect consumption.

For a few years, he led the Nordic Food Lab research and development team -- part of the three-Michelin-starred NOMA restaurant -- trying to figure out ways to insert insects into our diet.

""Lots of cultures associate the insect with an ingredient,"" Flore says. That said, Sardinians prefer the cheese to the maggot and are often horrified by the idea that people eat scorpions or crickets in Thailand.

Flore says he's traveled around the world to study how different cultures approach insects as food and believes that while psychological barriers make it difficult to radically alter eating habits, such consumption is widespread.

Open mind

""How do you define edible food?"" he says .""Every region of the world has a different way to eat insects.""

He's convinced that Sardinia's delicacy is safe to eat.

""I believe that nobody has ever died eating casu marzu. If they did, maybe they were drunk. You know, when you eat it, you also drink lots of wine.""

Flore hopes casu marzu will soon shed its clandestine status and become a symbol of Sardinia -- not because of its unusual production, but because it's emblematic of other foods now vanishing because they don't fit in with modern mainstream tastes.

In 2005, researchers from Sardinia's Sassari University made the first step in this direction: they raised flies in the lab and made them infect pecorino cheese to show that the process can happen in a controlled way.

Islanders and researchers hope that the European Union will soon rule in their favor.

Until then, anyone who wants to sample it will need to ask around when they get to Sardinia.

For those willing to suspend concerns about what they're eating, it offers an authentic experience recalling a time when nothing was thrown away and when boundaries of what was edible or not were less well defined.

Cheesemonger Murrocu says that, fittingly, locals keep an open mind about the best way to eat casu marzu, but a few other regional treats have been known to help it slip down easier.",
"Year-round sunshine, pool days and zero taxes: How to move to Dubai and work remotely for a year","(CNN) — As global business and travel hubs remain largely closed off to the masses, Dubai is making entry easier than ever for international visitors.

The glitzy city, as well as the United Arab Emirates as a whole, has for years been opening up its once-strict residency and tourist visa rules, but has accelerated its changes in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, the country announced a UAE-wide remote working visa program (similar to one announced in Dubai in October), in a bid to attract a growing global pool of digital nomads as temporary working-from-home situations become more permanent.

The visa is being marketed as a chance for remote workers to take advantage of the country's low taxes -- the UAE does not impose income tax on its residents -- as well as its year-round sunshine and five-star lifestyle.

The move is a bold one in the face of a mass exodus of expats leaving the UAE, where foreign workers reportedly make up about 90% of a 10-million strong population. But Dubai is also tapping into a growing global trend; other tourist destinations such as Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bermuda, Estonia, Georgia and Mauritius have unveiled similar remote working visas.

Alongside the UAE-wide remote visa announcement, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai, announced the adoption of multi-entry tourist visas for all nationalities. The five-year visa enables tourists to enter multiple times and remain in the country for 90 days on each visit, which can be extended for another 90 days.

Long-term destination for expats

It's the latest in a string of initiatives Dubai has recently introduced to try to cement itself as a long-term destination for expats.

Previously, people could not move to Dubai without a job offer from a UAE-based employer, with workplaces responsible for providing two-year renewable residence visas and medical insurance. Permanent options, such as residency or retirement, were not available to expats.

But the first seeds for permanent residency were sown in 2018, when a five-year retirement visa was introduced for the first time.

In 2019, the country introduced ""golden visas."" This meant high-profile investors and businesspeople could apply for 10-year and five-year visas. It was extended to more sectors, such as doctors and engineers, in November 2020.

And in January this year, perhaps the biggest announcement of all, the government opened up Emirati citizenship to expats.

Issam Kazim, chief executive of Dubai's Tourism Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTM), told CNN in late March that around 1,700 applications for the remote working visa had been received since October. ""Most"" of these applications have been accepted and issued, he says.

In January, Kazim told CNN a further 16,000 foreigners -- many of them foreign workers -- had opted to stay on in the UAE after Dubai announced a complimentary one-month extension to all tourist visas in December due to the onset of global lockdowns. Kazim says he expected many of these to ""convert into full-time-working virtual applicants in the weeks ahead.""

""Dubai's response to this pandemic has only strengthened the perception of the city with regards to our proposition, and this is translating into strong uptake of people choosing Dubai as a permanent or semi-permanent base,"" Kazim says.

'One of my favorite cities'

The UAE is currently leading one of the world's fastest vaccination drives, with the government saying more than half of its eligible population has already been vaccinated.

CNN spoke to several digital nomads who have applied for the remote working visa, who cited Dubai's lifestyle, its weather and its relative affordability in comparison to other expat centers such as Singapore or Hong Kong as prime reasons to relocate.

Peter Walsh, co-founder of an education company in Canada, says he applied for the visa as he'd lived in Saudi Arabia as a teenager and Dubai remains ""one of my favorite cities.""

He planned on working remotely from the UAE for up to a year to begin with, and possibly extending after that.

""I was originally planning to take out the family for an extended break. Maybe as a bonus, get vaccinations while we're there,"" Walsh says.

""It's been a tough year with Covid so getting a break was my main motivation.""

Walsh applied for the visa on February 16 and was issued an entry permit on March 2. From there, he has 60 days to enter Dubai. However, with Canada introducing a 14-day quarantine for those returning from abroad, and with relatively high costs for sponsoring families in the UAE, he's not managed to make it to Dubai yet.

The tax question

For entrepreneur Deeya Khemlani, swapping 4 p.m. winter sunsets in London for year-round sunshine in Dubai is enough to sell her on the scheme.

Khemlani, one of the founders of fashion label Izaak Azanei, has been frequenting Dubai for years for business, and is excited at the prospect of splitting her time more permanently between the two.

""The city really offers the best of everything and it's a great location geographically for me to get to the countries I need to be for work,"" Khemlani says.

Before the UK travel corridor closed, Khemlani had been flying ""back and forth"" between London and Dubai relatively often, so had not finalized her application yet. However, she intends to in the near future.

""Quite honestly, during the winter months, Dubai is a welcome escape,"" she says.

But while the program is being advertised as a shortcut to a tax-free salary, the reality is that applicants will probably still be taxed in their home country.

David Daly, partner at UAE-based Gulf Tax Accounting Group, says residents of other countries wanting to earn a tax-free salary would need to declare themselves a non-resident of their home country first, which isn't possible while holding a full-time job there.

The matter of double taxation then depends on tax agreements between each country. Nearly 120 countries have reciprocal taxation agreements with the UAE, to ensure individuals and businesses are only taxed once.

Conscious decoupling

There are also some caveats to take into consideration.

For the remote working scheme, you must be earning a minimum of $5,000 per month to apply. It costs $287 per year, plus medical insurance with valid UAE cover and a processing fee per person.

For a retirement visa, applicants must be 55 or older, have valid UAE health insurance and fulfill one of these three requirements: earn a monthly income of Dh20,000 (around $5,500); have Dh1 million in cash savings; or own property in Dubai worth Dh2 million.

Murtaza Khan, partner at immigration firm Fragomen, says there appears to be a ""decoupling of visa sponsorship and employment.""

""In order to attract and retain the best and brightest talent, the country's immigration policy needs to provide appropriate options,"" he says.

Looking forward, he believes there may be further policies that provide a ""balanced employment relationship between foreign workers and employers, rather than the historical sponsorship-led approach.""",
The Americans who bought a house in Italy over the internet,"(CNN) — How many of us have been sitting at home, seen a dreamy picture of a foreign country, and started planning our life there?

That'd be a lot. But how many of us have actually gone ahead, bought a property and planned that future life -- without setting foot in the location?

Michael Barrett may just be a first.

The Chicago native spent much of last year's lockdown drooling over homes for sale in Italy. But instead of being content with drooling, he and wife Aida went one step further -- and bought a house, sight unseen.

And, he says, buying a property remotely was far more sensible than doing what many non-Italians do -- come on vacation, fall in love, visit a handful of places, and make an offer.

In fact, he reckons, this could be the way forward in a post-pandemic world.

It sounds like a horror story. Sixty-something American couple buy house abroad without seeing it, without having met the seller, the agent, the architect or even the internet friend who signed on the dotted line for them.

But the Barretts are convinced this was the smartest thing they could do.

Decisions, decisions

First things first. Michael and Aida Barrett may live in Wisconsin, but they aren't Italy newbies.

Aida is from Calabria -- the couple met when she came on vacation to Chicago 35 years ago. Ever since their wedding, they've made regular visits across the pond -- she going home every year for a couple of months; he joining her for two or three weeks, every other year.

They spend half their time at her family's villa in Calabria, and half exploring the rest of Italy.

That's how Michael Barrett fell for the country. Aida ""opened my frontiers,"" he says. He grew to be deeply in love with Italy -- but the real Italy, not the one foreigners tend to fantasize about. They decided that when they retired, it had to be there.

""I'm maybe a little bit more enthusiastic about uprooting ourselves than my wife,"" he says. ""She knows every detail of Italian culture -- she's from Amantea [Calabria] and has a degree in Italian history and literature. But I was the one saying every couple weeks, 'Let's go to Italy.' I love every detail of the place, I really do. I've been dreaming about moving forever.""

The Barretts agreed that they'd see out their retirement in Italy -- but they also knew that things in Italy take time.

""You have to be very patient doing anything in Italy, and we didn't want to be in a B&B for two years while our house was renovated,"" says Michael Barrett. ""We were happy to uproot ourselves, but not without reestablishing new roots. Being nomads isn't a great option at our age.""

Decision one: taken. They wanted to buy a few years before retirement, to have their dream home ready to move in to on day one. It was late 2019 at this point, and they decided that 2020 would be the time to buy.

Decision two: where to buy. That one was a little harder.

The legendary $1 homes of southern Italy weren't for the Barretts. For one thing, they'd require too much time and renovation. For another, they'd spent a lot of time in Amantea, and worked out that southern Italy was too remote from the major cities for them.

So they compiled a list of requirements. A very specific one, too.

""It had to be within two hours of a major city with advanced medical care and a large international airport,"" says Barrett, who says they were looking for something ""cheap and cheerful"" rather than the statement properties American immigrants often seek out in Europe.

""We wanted to be near water, within walking distance. We also wanted to be within walking distance of a train station and market so that we could have the option of being car-free.

""The property needed to be fit for habitation -- no derelict one euro deals for us. Three bedrooms and two or more bathrooms.""

Oh, and they didn't want to be near other Americans.

""When I see a bunch of American tourists, I want to go someplace else,"" says Barrett. ""I feel like I'm in Disneyland.

""Whenever I'm in Italy, I want to be as Italian as I can possibly be. Picking oranges off the tree, riding my bike around the countryside, cooking meals in the kitchen, striking up conversation with random people in my terrible Italian. I like to be transported to a completely different culture.""

Finding the right location

So with expat-heavy locations such as Tuscany ruled out, in January 2020, they started surfing the internet, looking for places that might fit the bill -- and where they could find something in their price range of €75,000-€200,000 ($88,000-$236,000).

They started making plans to fly to Italy in April or May 2020, hoping to have put together a shortlist for viewing by then.

But with their daughter working in Brussels -- for Pfizer, no less -- it was clearer to them earlier than to many that the trip might not happen.

""Our home-buying plans were in jeopardy, but I was enjoying my online search activities,"" says Barrett.

So the couple kept looking.

""We found a couple of properties that might have worked around the lakes on the Lazio-Tuscany border, but since we hadn't been there, we couldn't see ourselves as happy,"" he says.

Instead, they started homing in on Italy's northern lakes region, within spitting distance of Milan and its two international airports.

And although Como and the classic locations were well out of their budget, they couldn't help noticing that the southern part of Lago Maggiore -- west of Como, straddling the Swiss border -- had properties that fit the bill.

It was little over an hour's drive to Milan, half that to Malpensa airport -- which could whisk them around Europe, as well as back home -- and they had the Alps on the doorstep.

In fact, it reminded them of their current home, in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin -- an easy drive to Chicago and O'Hare airport, but with a laidback, lakeside life where they could keep their boat on the water.

What's more, where Como has a ""congested waterfront"" and steep hills behind it, Barrett says that Maggiore is less steep, which means more room to build.

""We quickly focused on Maggiore. We kept looking at other listings, but were returning to Maggiore week after week as it fit our requirements.""

There was just one issue: although they'd visited the lakes region before and been to Como, neither Michael nor Aida had ever been to Maggiore.

Buying a house virtually

So how does one go about buying a house in a place one's never been to, during a global lockdown?

For the Barretts, it was simple -- just involve a third party.

When their requests to on-the-ground real estate agents went unanswered, they made contact with realtor Sean Carlos , who's based between Milan and Tuscany.

They told him their plan: that they would draw up a shortlist of properties, and he would go visit them and take them on virtual walk-throughs. For any that they were interested in, they'd commission an architect's report. And if they wanted to buy, Carlos would be the lynchpin.

Where did they find him? On a Facebook group. Perhaps that makes you feel queasy, but the Barretts are matter-of-fact about it.

""When I spoke to him I realized it wasn't just me interviewing him, he was interviewing me, and that made me more comfortable,"" says Michael Barrett.

""We talked about our family history -- that my wife had graduated from Rome university, my daughter from Milan. He screened me to the same extent as I screened him, and I think if I'd come off as a novice, he'd have said no.""

Carlos confirms that.

""I do have to be careful with the people I work with, so I ask a lot of questions at the beginning to see where they are in their thought process, and if they're just window-shopping,"" he says.

""The fact that Michael's wife was Italian, and he's spent a significant amount of time in Italy meant they were much higher on the knowledge curve than a lot of foreigners who've maybe vacationed here a couple of times.""

So he agreed to take them on as his first ever remote buyers.

Of course, they didn't realize just how remote it would be at that point -- the Barretts thought their daughter could fly down from Belgium to sign for it. But that wasn't to be.

'Like making an Airbnb reservation'

The couple also looked at a house in Lesa, but knew immediately it wasn't for them. Shutterstock

From March to May last year, Michael and Aida were scouring the internet for potential homes.

""Deciding on locations was almost exactly the same process we had used while taking our Italian vacations -- we would check the local amenities and look at transportation and climate, and look to see what local life would be like, including shopping opportunities,"" says Barrett.

They set up a chain -- they would find listings of potential homes, and pass them on to Carlos, who'd do his own research.

""If the property had merit, he would contact the local seller's agent and get additional information,"" explains Barrett.

""Sean was very good at filling in the blanks in terms of having a complete virtual process. Transatlantic home shopping became a process similar to making an Airbnb reservation, only the stakes were much higher.""

Barrett, a product manager who makes international sales in his day job, took the process in his stride.

Finally, they found a place that looked good. It was in Lesa, on the western, Piedmont side of Lake Maggiore -- and even had a lake view from the top floor. But on a video tour with Carlos, it was clear that it was in a much worse state than the (old) listing photos had suggested. ""I decided halfway through the video tour it was no good,"" says Barrett.

So they moved on to the next. Five miles south from Lesa was Meina, another lakeside town. Here, a pretty shrub-topped stone arch led onto a track with lemon-painted houses either side -- one of which was for sale.

It was a three-story house from the early 1900s: three bedrooms, three bathrooms. It opened onto a courtyard shared with nearby houses -- offering both privacy and parking.

They quickly commissioned an architect's report. It was in good condition, he wrote, and had been lived in until recently by an elderly couple -- it just needed nipping and tucking, having last been renovated in the 1990s. A video tour confirmed: they might be nearly 5,000 miles away, but they liked it. They made an offer: €75,000 ($88,000). The owners counter offered: €85,000 ($100,000). They agreed.

""We purchased entirely on the information in the architect's report,"" admits Barrett.

""This may be less romantic than falling in love with a property while on vacation. However, it allows a highly qualified local professional to detail the property from a technical point of view. He not only evaluates details most homebuyers miss, but plans for future renovations.

""It made me almost anxious, it was so easy.""

Signing on the dotted line

So they'd found The One. Next up -- how to complete the sale. It was July, and there was still no way the Barretts would be able to fly over from the US.

They agreed that their daughter would drive down from Brussels, inspect the house for her parents, and then sign the deeds, using a power of attorney. But by the time they'd navigated the long Italian summer holidays and an unresponsive notary, it was late October, and the second wave of the pandemic was gathering force in Italy. They scheduled for early November, and then canceled. The Barretts didn't want to put their daughter at risk.

But they couldn't buy the house without a proxy signing the deeds for them.

Enter the knight in shining armor -- and a whole lot more trust.

A meeting of minds

Have you ever met someone on social media and become firm friends without ever having met?

It's happened to many of us during the pandemic, and Michael Barrett is no different.

A keen cyclist -- ""I'm one of those guys who gets into lycra and onto his bike,"" he says -- he's a member of various Facebook cycling groups, and back in summer 2020, he'd noticed some pictures of a bike ride around Lake Como, posted by a guy called Doug Ritter.

""I wondered, what's an American doing in Italy right now? I was curious and frustrated -- I love taking long bike rides on vacation -- and I sent him a private message, saying, 'I really enjoyed your post, you must be a resident,'"" he says.

Cyclists, he reckons, understand each other. ""You have to trust them -- if they turn or stop quickly, all of you hit the pavement at 20mph.""

And so, after a few months chatting about Italy (Ritter lives in Milan) and cycling, he had a thought. What if Doug acted as their proxy?

They didn't take it lightly. Although they were buying the property in cash, that cash was, says Barrett, ""a large fraction of our retirement savings -- the loss of the money or any real estate fraud would have been catastrophic.""

Related content A 50-year pen pal friendship that began with a message in a bottle

But from his experience so far, he trusted Carlos. And his cyclist's intuition meant he trusted Ritter, too.

Also, he points out, he wasn't transferring the money to either of them. It was going directly to the owners via the notary.

Another plus point? Ritter had bought two properties in northern Italy in the past three years. He knew what to look for -- and what to look out for.

And that's how the Barretts ended up asking a man they'd never met before to sign the deeds for a home they'd never seen, having been shown around it virtually by another complete stranger, with the whole process being overseen by the notary -- who, again, they'd never met.

The moment of truth

December 2, the date set for the handover, there was a storm over Lake Maggiore. Ritter arrived to find the house had been hit by rain and snow. That, says Barrett, turned out to be a plus point -- it meant that if there'd been a problem with leakage, it'd have shown up.

""I asked him to walk through the place an hour beforehand, and said, if you think it's a disaster, you don't even have to explain why -- just walk away,"" says Barrett.

""Making a setback financially was not on the cards -- I'd have trusted him if he'd said there were too many things wrong.""

In fact, Ritter and his Italian fiancée thought it was great.

""They said it's a good starting point -- that it was a charming house, needs work, but it was watertight and weathertight. And they said the town was fabulous.""

They -- or, rather, Ritter -- signed the dotted line.

There is work to be done on the property. The Barretts are working with architect Emanuele Monti , who produced the initial report, to remove one of the three bathrooms and all-round upgrade the house, adding insulation and rewiring it, and then redecorating.

But using Italy's economy-rebooting ""superbonus"" scheme, they can claim tax breaks on the work, so they'll end up spending €22,000 ($26,000) to receive €97,000 ($114,000) worth of work.

""Now we're feeling smart,"" says Barrett.

They think the works will take a while to complete, but they hope that they can swiftly make one of the three levels habitable so they can stay there before too long.

Worst case scenario

It has been nearly four months since Michael and Aida Barrett bought the house in which they're planning to spend their retirement. And they still haven't seen it. They're hoping to get there once they've been vaccinated and travel restrictions have relaxed.

So what if, when they get there, they don't like it?

Turns out, they've discussed that.

""The worst case scenario is that we don't like it,"" says Michael Barrett.

""Then what would we do? Well, we'd have a place to live in while we search for an alternative, which is nice. And then we'd rent it -- I think it'd rent pretty easily, so there is a plan B if we don't like it.""

Of course, they're hoping plan A -- to live in it for ever more -- will prevail.

""We're 90% sure it's the right one, only because our expectations are quite modest,"" he says.

""In this price range normally you'd find something with one or two bedrooms, or concrete architecture, so our choice was something newer but much more austere.

""We knew that was the alternative -- not beautiful, and not really Italian. This is better, at the same price. We like the idea of the courtyard, the arch with the tree growing out of it.

""We could be wrong -- but we think we've done it.""

Barrett -- backed up by Sean Carlos, the realtor -- says what they did isn't for everyone. If you want to know how the light falls at a certain time of day, or want to feel the house, you're not going to buy remotely. ""I don't think what we did replaces buying locally,"" he says. What's more, the Barretts were consulting a Milanese friend throughout the process -- and of course Aida and their daughter speak fluent Italian.

Even so, he says he'd recommend a hybrid of what they did to everyone.

""I'd say 70% of the work is searching online anyway, and I'd recommend using a local architect -- have a second pair of eyes, someone who's local looking at it.

""Do your diligence upfront, and if you find something you really like, you can jump on a plane... to calm the nerves. But do that after you've searched online, the architect has done a report and you know what the climate and population is like.""

And while what they did is certainly clinical, he thinks it's a better approach than the standard ""fall-in-love-on-vacation-and-buy-on-the-spot"" situation.

""I actually think it's a disaster for an American on vacation to buy property,"" he says.",
"Woman buys traditional house for $8,000, ships it across Indonesia to create Bali dream home","(CNN) — Bali first captured Kayti Denham's heart when she came to the Indonesian island for her honeymoon in the 1980s.

""When the plane door opened onto the tarmac, the heady tropical aroma promised everything the UK did not,"" she recalls. ""The chance to be frolicsome and sun-drenched.""

She held that memory close, and returned to the island now and then to reconnect. The marriage didn't last, but Denham says she fell more deeply in love with Bali than she ever has with a man.

After 25 years in the UK, Denham moved to Australia's Byron Bay, where she launched a range of aromatherapy skin care products with a friend. Later in Sydney she worked with a local production company as a scriptwriter.

Fast-forward to 2004, when Denham left Australia for a teaching job in Bali, which led to a series of positions with international schools on the island. She continued to take writing commissions on the side, including a stint writing for Scottish chef Will Meyrick, founder of Sarong and Mamasan, two of the island's most celebrated locavore restaurants.

A lifelong lover of live music, Denham crossed paths with Robi Supriyanto, frontman for the popular Balinese rock band Navicula. In Indonesia, Supriyanto is known not only for his energetic grunge-inspired performances, but for his involvement in sustainable agriculture and his efforts to encourage pride in the farming life, passions that Denham shared through her work with Meyrick and studies with permaculture guru Bill Mollison in Australia.

""If you want to know Balinese culture, just open the traditional Balinese calendar,"" Supriyanto told CNN in 2018. ""Everything relates to agricultural elements. If you want to preserve Balinese culture, you have to preserve agriculture too.""

Denham discussed such ideas with Supriyanto, who lives in Bali's Ubud town with his American wife and child.

""We talked about how nice it would be to establish a home farm where one could practice permaculture and grow organic produce,"" she says. ""For me, it probably comes from fantasies I had when reading Laura Ingalls Wilder books as a child.""

""I had to work on trust and have people trust me""

Supriyanto helped her find a semi-rural property in Tabanan Regency, often referred to as ""the real Bali,"" where terraced rice fields follow the land's natural contours with the sleeping volcano of Mount Batukaru in the background.

Stone-walled family compounds employ subak, the Balinese community-based irrigation control system, for their farms.

Here Denham could make her dream real. She formed a partnership with Supriyanto to secure the land in 2015, and through a lawyer drew up contracts that designated Denham and her daughters Kepsibel and Severen, both living in Australia, as legal lessees.

""I didn't have a pile of money to invest, just my monthly teaching salary,"" Denham says. ""I had to work on trust and have people trust me. The phrase I repeated to myself over and over was 'It will work out.'""

The 1.2-hectare property abuts national conservation forest near Desa Sanda, a village which, as Denham puts it, ""lives by seasons and rituals, market days and motorbikes.""

Denham leased a plot of land surrounded by durian and mango orchards in a village that ""lives by seasons and rituals."" Kayti Denham

Surrounded by durian and mango orchards, the plot slopes from misty wooded hills into a valley and through a terraced coffee farm inherited as part of the purchase, before ending at a natural spring. The spring flows into the Balian River, sacred among the Balinese because 16th-century Javanese Hindu sage Dang Hyang Nirartha placed his staff in the river, giving it the power to heal the sick. The river empties into the Indian Ocean at Balian Beach, famed for its uncrowded surf scene, 40 minutes away by car.

""I can't see the ocean from the land, but it's cooler up in the hills,"" says Denham. ""Beautiful clouds roll in during the afternoon, and at night the skies are often clear and bright.""

Finding the right limasan

Two years after acquiring the land, Denham and Supriyanto traveled to central Java to find a limasan, a traditional wooden home with a millennium-old design history in Java and South Sumatra.

The high, hipped roofs collect hot air that rises during the day, keeping the lower living area cool. They're popular nowadays with developers who tweak them into luxury villas or boutique hotels, but Javanese locals are less enthralled with maintaining the old structures, and are happy to sell them wall-by-wall.

Denham found a vacant limasan in the former royal capital of Surakarta, commonly known as Solo these days, and after negotiating a price -- $7,000 -- hired artisans to disassemble the home, load it into a truck, and deliver it over 600 kilometers to Bali, which cost about $650.

The Javanese crew arrived in shorts and t-shirts, and Tabanan's cool mountain air took them by surprise.

""I went to the land shortly after they were supposed to re-assemble the limasan to find them shivering around a fire,"" Denham says. ""I rounded up blankets, jumpers and jackets, and we built a sleeping shelter. But in addition to not taking to the mountain weather, there was tension between them and the local Balinese.""

Eventually the Javanese went home to Solo, and Denham finished the house with the help of Ketut, a Balinese artisan who had worked on the home she rented in Kerobokan.

She continued teaching to maintain funds for building her dream. Whenever possible, she drove from Kerobokan to Desa Sanda with her builder Ketut to monitor progress.

When it was finished, the re-assembled and expanded T-shaped home measured 11 by 10 meters in front and 22 by 5 meters in the back. An indoor toilet was added, and Denham began moving in furniture, bookcases and antique trunks.

The interior began taking shape, starting with a huge kitchen centered on a large table seating 12.

""I still had one foot in the expat-oriented international school world, but I started getting closer to the Sanda community, and hearing of their desire to make the village an eco-tourism destination,"" Denham says. ""Up the road from the house, there's an organic bakery, making fresh bread and cakes to sell to cafes down south. I also found locals making organic jams, handmade soaps and shampoo.""

To develop the land surrounding the house, a group of locals and expats, including a number of Denham's former international school students, organized a ""Permablitz,"" a kind of rapid-attack permaculture event. They built bamboo outhouses with long-drop toilets, and started work on an organic vegetable garden, while camping out and playing music with the locals in the evening.

Seeing the property fill with coffee, cacao, durian, mangosteen, and avocado, all grown organically, Denham felt her dreams meld effortlessly with those of the community.

Kept away by the pandemic

In July 2018, Denham flew to Australia to take a teaching job in a remote outback desert town, returning to Bali over school holidays to work further on the house. She spent most of her 2019 Christmas vacation moving the remainder of her worldly goods from Kerobokan, where her lease had ended, to Sanda.

She made a decision that rather than unpack, she would store everything safely and give herself the opportunity to sink into the ambiance of her beautiful house, with its antique wooden living room, spacious kitchen and spare lockup room where she stored her material life.

""The rain fell, the leaves dripped, the birds called, civets screeched and nothing much else happened, except for one night when a hunter took shelter from the rain and gave me a bit of a fright. But those last days in the house were nothing short of heavenly.""

She flew back to Australia after Christmas to resume teaching, telling her Bali friends, ""See you in April!""

When April 2020 came, the unexpected pandemic travel protocols left Denham stranded in Australia. It's now been over a year since she's been to her home in Bali. At this point, Denham says ""I'm living on WhatsApp messages. I get sent pictures of my beautiful house in the big woods, empty and waiting for my return.""

"Raya, 'The Equalizer' and Wanda Maximoff are strong female characters taking the lead","A version of this story appeared in CNN's Pop Life Chronicles newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . Tell us what you'd like to see more of in the newsletter at entertainment.newsletter@cnn.com .

(CNN) Fierce female roles have always existed in Hollywood, but as the industry sees more female directors and producers, there has been a recent influx of more powerful female characters on both big and small screens.

Even Disney princesses have evolved beyond those waiting on their Prince Charming to make their lives better.

Take for example:

Kelly Marie Tran voiced lead character Raya in Disney's ""Raya and the Last Dragon.""

This Disney film stirred a bit of controversy with its casting , but the warrior princess is indeed that -- a warrior.

Inspired by Southeast Asian cultures, the animated film offers the latest Disney heroine whose spirit evokes similarly strong-willed characters like Mulan and Merida.

Tran voices Raya, who sets out on a quest to save her people.

In real life, Tran is no less fierce, though her battles have been mostly against racism and trolls

As the first Asian American actor cast in a lead role in a ""Star Wars"" movie, she was subjected to an onslaught of online harassment and bullying that eventually forced her to abandon social media altogether.

""(Raya) sees the world in this doe-eyed idyllic way, and then the world sort of breaks, and it changes the way in which she interacts with the world,"" Tran told The Hollywood Reporter . ""That was my way (into the character). I've definitely in the past viewed the world through rose-colored glasses, and now I feel like I'm in the back, smoking a cigarette, (saying), 'I've seen things.'""

Queen Latifah stars in the CBS drama ""The Equalizer.""

Queen Latifah in ""The Equalizer"": The actress/singer/rapper stars as single mom Robyn McCall The actress/singer/rapper stars as single mom Robyn McCall in the CBS reboot , which this time features a Black woman as the under-the-radar guardian angel who has all types of skills to aid those in need.

No one is better suited to discuss the change in Hollywood than the show's executive producer, Debra Martin Chase.

She is the first African American woman to produce a feature film that grossed more than $100 million (""Courage Under Fire"" starring Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan) and the first African American female producer to sign an overall deal with a major studio.

Chase also produced ""The Princess Diaries,"" ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" and ""The Cheetah Girls"" films, as well the Emmy-award-winning ""Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella,"" which had a diverse cast including singers Brandy and the late Whitney Houston . (And like ""Raya"" is available on Disney+.)

""This is the best it has been since I have been in Hollywood,"" Chase told CNN in a recent interview.

""That's not to say that there's not more work to do because there definitely is,"" she said. ""But I think there's finally a recognition in Hollywood that stories about people of color, about women of color, about women have an audience and can be profitable.""

The original ""Equalizer"" aired in the '80s and starred Edward Woodward. This time around, Chase said, Queen Latifiah is killing the role because ""she's totally believable kicking some ass, plus she's beautiful.""

""We have this amazing creative team, but I also think that the world is ready to see a Black woman who is taking no prisoners and out there helping people who need help,"" Chase said. ""The world is not in a great place right now so don't we all wish there was someone who could right the scales for us?""

(From left) Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen are shown in a scene from ""WandaVision.""

Elizabeth Olsen in ""WandaVision"": How to say this without any spoilers?

Let's just say there is a moment in the finale of the hit Disney+ miniseries that perfectly displays the theme here of powerful female characters.

Olsen stars as Wanda Maximoff / the Scarlet Witch opposite Paul Bettany as Vision.

To be sure, the Marvel Universe is filled with heroic women who are literally super (powered).

But there is just something about Olsen in this role and the range of emotions she pulls off seamlessly that sets her apart.

Not to mention the strength of the love story at the center of the series.

""Wanda and Vision's journey to this point is a story of pure, innocent love and deep connection with another person,"" Olsen told Elle . ""It was also very traumatizing. Tragedy has always been their story. In our show, we kind of wipe that clean and start fresh.""

Now, if only we could get some of these female heroines to work on things like pay equity in the real world and such.

For your weekend

Three things to watch:

'WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn'

Co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann is shown in a scene from ""WeWork: Or The Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn.""

With interviews featuring journalists, experts and high-ranking former employees, this documentary tells the story of ""the rise and fall of one of the biggest corporate flameouts and venture capitalist bubbles in recent years.""

It offers a behind-the-scenes look of what happened with both the company and its controversial co-founder and former CEO, Adam Neumann.

The doc starts streaming Friday on Hulu.

'Tina'

Tina Turner (center) performs in the 1970s, as shown in the HBO documentary ""Tina.""

Speaking of documentaries, if you haven't yet seen the one on Tina Turner, what are you waiting for?

At 81 years young, the woman who survived a great deal to become an icon shares parts of her story you may not have known.

Not to mention the music!

""Tina"" is currently on HBO, which is owned by CNN's parent company.

'Magical Andes: Season 2'

Andean women are shown in traditional dress in a scene from ""Magical Andes: Season 2"" on Netflix.

Spanning seven countries in South America, the Andes always have another adventure to tell. Discover these stories in the second season of this docuseries, which introduces viewers to both the inspiring landscape and the people.

It's currently streaming on Netflix.

Two things to listen to:

Singer Foxes took a hiatus from music for a bit but she's back with an official EP release Thursday.

She has been on the music scene for a while, but Louisa Rose Allen, better known as Foxes, really hasn't released a ton of music.

The English singer gained popularity back in 2012 as the singer on producer Zedd's hit, ""Clarity.""

Her debut album, ""Glorious,"" was released in 2014 followed by her second studio album, ""All I Need,"" two years later.

After a four-year hiatus, Foxes released some singles in 2020 and is now blessing us with an EP, ""Friends in the Corner,"" out Thursday.

Pop star Demi Lovato opens up in a scene from her new docuseries.

If pain truly does produce good music, expect a blockbuster from Demi Lovato.

""If you listen to it track by track, if you follow the track listing, it's kind of actually like the non-official soundtrack to the documentary,"" Variety reported Lovato saying earlier this month during a livestream on Clubhouse. ""Because it really does follow my life over the past couple of years.""

The new album is set to drop Friday.

One thing to talk about:

Actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas is dishing up some of the food from her homeland.

It has been a tough time in the restaurant industry, but with the Covid vaccine rollout underway and summertime coming soon, will things change?

Actress/producer Priyanka Chopra Jonas appears to be betting so.

She's a collaborator for Sona, a new restaurant in the Gramercy area of New York City.

""SONA is the very embodiment of timeless India and the flavours I grew up with,"" she wrote in an announcement in early March on her verified Instagram account. ""The kitchen is helmed by the incredible Chef @harinayak, a masterful talent, who has created the most delicious and innovative menu, taking you on a food journey through my amazing country.""

If anyone can help turn the place into a hot spot, it has got to be the charismatic Chopra Jonas, who is a well-known foodie and a shrewd businesswoman

Something to sip on

Chrissy Teigen had more than 13 million followers on Twitter.

I know I'm not the only one who misses Chrissy Teigen on Twitter.

It has been more than a week since the power user deleted her account , explaining that after a decade it ""no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that's the right time to call something.""

Trolling her husband John Legend, taking on injustice and more, Teigen was all the things I enjoy about the social media platform.

But it appears that all the things I really dislike about it drove her away. This is a woman who has literally shared her tragedies ( the loss of their son Jack to pregnancy complications, for one ) and her triumphs with us, so whatever works for her I support.

And we will be here should she ever decide to come back.",2021-04-01 00:00:00

'The Serpent' sinks its teeth in with a true-crime tale set in the 1970s,"(CNN) Even taking acknowledged creative liberties, the true story at the core of ""The Serpent"" sinks its teeth into you, chronicling a murder spree by a slick con man, and the unlikely diplomat whose determined efforts helped apprehend him. Anchored by Tahar Rahim (""The Mauritanian""), the eight-part series drags in places, but gradually becomes the kind of binge that those who get drawn in might well consume in a weekend.

The miniseries mostly works by capturing a very specific time in the 1970s, when hippie backpackers jaunted around Asia, often in need of a friendly face and sympathetic ear as they quested for spiritual enlightenment. Their openness made them easy prey for the suave Charles Sobhraj (Rahim), who, with the complicity of his somewhat-reluctant girlfriend Marie-Andrée Leclerc (Jenna Coleman), befriended them, poisoned them and eventually killed many of them, using their passports and cash to fuel his schemes.

The nature of Charles' illicit actions can become a bit murky, but it mostly involves trafficking in gems, cultivating the impression of being a well-to-do operator. When a couple of Danish youths join the ranks of the missing, an employee in the Dutch embassy in Thailand, Herman Knippenberg (Billy Howle), begins seeking answers regarding their whereabouts, turning him into an unlikely sleuth tirelessly tracking Sobhraj's moves.

Produced by Netflix with BBC One, the international cast doesn't exactly include a roster of household names, but that heightens the feeling of authenticity, along with a washed-out look that brings a genuine sense of horror to Sobhraj's crimes. Knippenberg, meanwhile, must struggle against bureaucracy not only involving local Thai authorities but officials at his embassy and others, who -- eager not to make waves, and disdainful of the victims -- keep missing opportunities to stop the killings in maddening fashion.

Coming after his role in ""The Mauritanian,"" the series provides another strong showcase for Rahim, this time as a ruthless killer completely devoid of empathy, who can seemingly talk anyone out of -- or into -- anything. The show provokes a nagging dread whenever Charles meets a new traveler or one of his adopted beneficiaries begins to harbor doubts about his feigned benevolence.

'Grey's Anatomy' brings back two more old characters,"(CNN) Two beloved characters were brought back on ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy"" from the show's past on Thursday night.

The late doctors Mark Sloan, played by Eric Dane, and Lexie Grey, played by Chyler Leigh, visited Meredith Grey (played by Ellen Pompeo), while she continues her battle with Covid-19.

When Meredith tells them she misses them, Lexie replies, ""That's kind of a waste of time because we never left you."" Mark adds, ""Sometimes we're right next to you, yelling in your ear.""

Lexie and Dane's McSteamy are the latest characters to join Derek Shepherd, played by Patrick Dempsey, and T.R. Knight's George O'Malley in Meredith's beach dreams.

Stabler and Benson reunite on 'Law & Order: SVU',"(CNN) After a decade of anticipation among viewers, Mariska Hargitay's Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni's Elliot Stabler reunited Thursday night.

The three-hour crossover episodes had been eagerly awaited by those who have missed their characters' chemistry.

""Law & Order: SVU"" premiered in 1999 with Hargitay and Meloni starring as investigators of sex crimes. It is a spinoff of the original ""Law & Order"" (which ended after 20 seasons in 2010) and is in its 22nd season with Hargitay at the helm.

'Made for Love' joins series probing the darker side of our high-tech future,"(CNN) ""Made for Love"" is the latest series set about 10 minutes in the future, focusing on the creepy potential of technology as a means of control. With Cristin Milioti at its center, this darkly comic HBO Max series uses that backdrop to offer an intriguing look at an abusive relationship, grounding its sci-fi flourishes in echoes from the here and now.

The show begins with a bang, as Milioti's Hazel Green escapes from the space-age compound she occupies with Byron Gogol (Billy Magnussen), the visionary billionaire founder of a tech company called (what else?) Gogol. Byron, it turns out, has made Hazel the guinea pig for the company's latest product, an innovation called Made for Love, which uses implanted microchips to produce ""commingled identities. Pure union,"" with the unsettling loss of autonomy that implies.

Hazel's flight takes her to her quirky dad (Ray Romano), who is in his own version of a twisted relationship with an artificial companion. The focus is on Hazel and her efforts to carve out independence, made harder by the fact that Byron -- thanks to his creation -- is able to track her moves.

After roles in ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Palm Springs,"" Milioti has seemed poised to break out in a big way, and this vehicle is well suited to capitalize on her wide-eyed stares, given the absurdity of Hazel's situation. The tone, incidentally, comes pretty close to HBO Max's ""The Flight Attendant, "" another series with a female lead thrust into serialized peril, and thus far one of the streaming service's most complete productions.

As for how Hazel and Byron met, that gradually comes out via a series of flashbacks (by now an overused device), charting the origins of the relationship and pangs of discomfort that began to emerge even before getting around to his unique rich-guy quirks, like grabbing a morning swim with his pet dolphin.

"'United States of Al' has good intentions, but not many laughs","(CNN) ""United States of Al"" has engendered advance debate over its depiction of an Afghan character, but the show plays less as offensive than dated and uninspired, built on ancient fish-out-of-water sitcom conventions. A US veteran and his Afghan interpreter sound like a logical TV odd couple, but the few tender moments work better than the broadly comic ones.

The series falls under the supervision of heavyweight producer Chuck Lorre (""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""Young Sheldon""), officially giving him stewardship of CBS' entire Thursday comedy block. Being prolific in TV, however, usually means your luck eventually runs out, and ""Al"" has the feel of an idea that sounded better during the pitch than in the execution, with the laughs ending up lost in translation.

The pilot opens with Riley (Parker Young) greeting Awalmir, a.k.a. Al (Adhir Kalyan), at the airport, having worked for years to bring him from Afghanistan to the US. Al's wide-eyed vision of America is expressed through a relentlessly upbeat demeanor, one that frequently references cultural differences with his homeland.

Al finds Riley at his own crossroads, having separated from his wife (Kelli Goss) and moved in with his crusty father (""Breaking Bad's"" Dean Norris). Dad means well, but he's a little fuzzy on the details, which might explain why keeps doing things like offering a beer to the new arrival, a practicing Muslim.

Because everything is new to Al, that's perhaps inevitably the primary source of the comedy. He sees owning a lawnmower as a sign of wealth, and chides Riley's young daughter for not treating her elders as respectfully as she would if he were still back home.

'Godzilla vs. Kong' turns the battle of 'alpha titans' into a C-level spectacle,"(CNN) Almost 60 years after they rumbled in a pretty awful 1962 movie -- featuring guys in monster suits destroying tiny models -- ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" reunite with all the wonders that modern special effects can offer and still don't much improve the results. After a lengthy buildup, this ""thrilla"" in the ""MonsterVerse"" -- for anyone with even modest expectations -- qualifies as a pretty sizable letdown.

To be fair, the movie was watched on a TV screen, which surely isn't the way that Warner Bros. (like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia) and Legendary Pictures originally intended it.

The film lands simultaneously on HBO Max and in theaters in the US -- having already roared out of the starting gate in some international markets -- but frankly, it's not like an Imax screen could fix the plot and dialogue in a script and story credited to five writers, directed by Adam Wingard.

Following a pair of Godzilla movies that bookended the dreary ""Kong: Skull Island,"" the film begins with the notion that the title monsters are ""alpha titans"" and ""ancient enemies,"" making a showdown inevitable. Still, Godzilla's sudden antisocial behavior represents a mystery to those who have witnessed his prior outings, causing them to search for the underlying cause.

As for Kong, he's under the care and supervision of Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) on his island home, accompanied by a deaf girl (Kaylee Hottle), who joins a rather long tradition of kids that have improbably befriended giant monsters. They reluctantly find themselves tagging along with an academic (Alexander Skarsgard) who is convinced he can locate Kong's historic home in the bowels of the Earth, a mission financed by the CEO of a company called Apex Cybernetics, played by Demián Bichir.

Rachel Bilson was 'super bummed' that Rami Malek made her take down a photo of them both from Instagram,"(CNN) Rachel Bilson had what she thought was a cool throwback photo of her and Rami Malek, but according to her, Malek didn't think so.

It turns out they went to high school together, and according to ""The O.C."" star, were good friends.

""We were in the same crew. We did 'The Crucible' together senior year,"" Bilson recounted during a recent appearance on Dax Shepard's podcast, ""Armchair Expert."" ""We were the leads in it together, like all these things. We kind of kept in contact a little bit.""

She said Malek has ""always been super talented. A really amazing actor, even in high school.""

Thanks to roles in the show ""Mr. Robot"" and his Oscar-winning turn as Freddie Mercury in ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" he's now pretty famous. So, Bilson thought it would be cool to share on social media a throwback pic of the two of them on their senior trip to Broadway in New York City.

Seth Rogen clarifies comments on Emma Watson 'storming off set',"(CNN) Seth Rogen is clarifying a story that he told British GQ about Emma Watson storming off the set of his 2013 film, ""This Is the End.""

Rogen took to Twitter on Monday night to explain what actually happened.

""I want to correct a story that has emerged from a recent interview I gave. It misrepresents what actually happened,"" he wrote. ""Emma Watson did not 'storm off the set' and it's shi--y that the perception is that she did. The scene was not what was originally scripted, it was getting improvised, changed drastically and was not what she agreed to. The narrative that she was in some way uncool or unprofessional is complete bulls--t.""

He continued: ""I was thrilled for the opportunity to work with her and would be thrilled to get that opportunity again. I am very sorry and disappointed that it happened, and I wish I had done more to prevent it.""

Rogen had originally said that Watson left a scene involving Danny McBride as a cannibal and Channing Tatum on a leash.

'The Irregulars' spins out Sherlock Holmes' sidekicks with an 'X-Files' twist,"(CNN) There have been so many variations on Sherlock Holmes that the idea of another -- especially built around teenagers -- didn't provoke much enthusiasm going in. But ""The Irregulars"" proves unexpectedly fun, in what amounts to a Victorian version of ""The X-Files,"" revising the most familiar characters while introducing a major dose of the supernatural to Baker Street.

Holmes himself, in fact, remains merely a shadowy presence through much of the series, which focuses on a highly resourceful group of street urchins, recruited by Holmes sidekick Dr. Watson (Royce Pierreson) to assist him in probing matters of the paranormal. Those strange occurrences add up to a larger threat, one that unfolds via a series of cliffhangers that make ""The Irregulars"" perfect fodder for a regular old binge.

The teens are a diverse lot, including a pair of sisters, Bea and Jessie (Thaddea Graham and Darci Shaw), the latter exhibiting eerie psychic powers. Adding to the soapy qualities, Bea encounters a slumming prince (Harrison Osterfield) who has defied his handlers by venturing out into the city, becoming an unlikely member of what amounts to this Victorian London-era version of the Scooby gang.

Written by Tom Bidwell, ""The Irregulars"" playfully jumbles expectations, while possessing a darker and harder edge than another recent Netflix production mixing teens with Arthur Conan Doyle's creation, the movie ""Enola Holmes,"" in what might be the most particular ""You might like"" combination the service can offer.

Street boys called the Irregulars were featured in a few of the original Holmes stories, but any similarity pretty much ends there. Indeed, the eight-episode series quickly takes on a life of its own, building toward a somewhat messy (perhaps inevitably, given the subject matter) conclusion that provides a degree of closure while leaving the door ajar for further adventures.

'Genius: Aretha' earns its respect with Cynthia Erivo's showstopping role,"(CNN) After Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso, ""Genius: Aretha"" is both the most commercial and the best installment of this National Geographic anthology series, powered by Cynthia Erivo's ""give her all the awards now"" performance as the Queen of Soul. Flitting around in time and covering a great deal of ground, the production earns a big helping of R-E-S-P-E-C-T to all concerned.

It helps that Aretha Franklin's extraordinary talent was matched by an equally dramatic life, one in which she dealt with disappointing men and worked with civil-rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. The first category begins with her father, Pastor C.L. Franklin (Courtney B. Vance), a philanderer who, an associate notes wryly, loves Saturday night as well as Sunday morning.

Aretha also marries young to a family friend (Malcolm Barrett), who can be both jealous and abusive. Seeking to manage her career, his style frequently works against her, adding to the roadblocks erected by race and resistance to her singing, as she says, the way she feels it.

Record executives, at first, don't know what to do with her, before she finds an ally in producer Jerry Wexler (David Cross). Yet even he needs some prodding and pushing to respect her artistic choices, including her desire to produce her records.

Under the stewardship of playwright Suzan-Lori Parks ( ""The United States vs. Billie Holiday"" ), ""Aretha"" liberally uses black-and-white flashbacks to explore her experiences as a young girl, played splendidly by Shaian Jordan. As the eight-episode series makes clear, her singing talents were honed in the pews of her father's church, against a backdrop of pain and heartache.

"'Black Widow' joins the streaming battle, but nobody's sure what winning looks like","(CNN) Wonder Woman, Mulan and now Black Widow have all been enlisted to help power streaming services. Yet despite that high-profile roster of heroes, it's a battle the studios deploying them appear somewhat conflicted about winning.

Disney has announced that ""Black Widow,"" the eagerly anticipated Marvel prequel starring Scarlett Johansson, will receive a simultaneous streaming release via Disney+ -- for a $30 premium -- in addition to hitting movie theaters in July. The model builds on what Warner Bros. tried with ""Wonder Woman 1984"" on HBO Max, minus the extra fee, and the exclusive $30 experiment with Disney's live-action ""Mulan"" in September.

The announcement -- and indeed, the last year of ""Will they or won't they?"" speculation about shifting major titles to streaming during the pandemic -- has unleashed a new round of discussion about what the right price should be for the privilege of watching such movies at home.

The related issue is that even studios remain unsure over how much they want to drive such viewing, given the sizable tradeoffs associated with promoting their streaming ventures at the expense of undermining movie-theater distribution, and the billion-dollar revenues that just one comic-book-style hit can generate.

What exactly does that tradeoff entail? The truth -- and the problem -- is that nobody precisely knows where the sweet spot is.

How many people crave the theatrical experience enough to bypass watching at home? How many movies can go to streaming without killing off theaters? What percentage of consumers who might not rush out to see ""Black Widow"" would pay to watch if all they have to do is push a few buttons to enjoy it with microwave popcorn on the couch?

Studios eager to build subscriber bases recognize sci-fi epics or showcases for Marvel and DC superheroes with $200-million budgets can't be fully supported by fees for Disney+ and HBO Max, respectively, meaning they need to preserve a theatrical model. (HBO Max is part of WarnerMedia, as is CNN.)

JUST WATCHED Patty Jenkins on making 'Wonder Woman 1984' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Patty Jenkins on making 'Wonder Woman 1984' 01:34

Those who gripe that $30 is a lot to ask for at-home viewing thus miss the point -- namely, that studios are engaged in a delicate balancing act, wanting to make their streaming services more attractive while still erecting enough of a barrier cost-wise to prevent a wholesale exodus away from traditional movie-going.

The pandemic has fueled such experimentation, in part out of necessity. Warner Bros. moved its entire 2021 slate to play simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max -- with ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" arriving March 31 on those terms -- but recently set a deal with Regal Cinemas that would restore a window of theatrical exclusivity next year, Deadline reported.

Still, doubt understandably lingers as to whether US theater attendance will come roaring back by the late spring or summer -- even with vaccine distribution exceeding the Biden administration's early estimates -- reflecting uncertainty over what the consumer market will look like in a few months' time, and the level of pent-up demand for out-of-home experiences.

""Black Widow"" could provide one of the truer tests of that, coming out during the summer, when more people will likely view going to theaters as a more reasonable option.

A few distributors, notably, are wagering that such demand will return sooner. Lionsgate, for example, is touting its planned May 14 release of ""Spiral: From the Book of Saw,"" starring Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson, saying the film ""will kick off a robust summer moviegoing season.""

The one indisputable fact is that Hollywood built up streaming during the pandemic while movie theaters sat dormant, sacrificing hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket sales. For the past year, amid delayed releases and fluctuating public-health news, streaming movies wasn't so much a master plan as trying to make the best of a terrible situation.

The big bet now in this high-stakes poker game appears to be on the fall, hoping that movie-goers will be ready by then to resume old habits. New York is targeting the same window for Broadway theaters, which could add to the sense of anticipation.

At this point, though, the entertainment industry has probably never known less about audience preferences not in terms of content, necessarily, but the when, where and how much. And consumers -- depending on what they're willing to pay, and where they're willing to go -- currently hold all the cards.",2021-03-26 00:00:00
'Long Live Rock' celebrates hard rock's communal vibe but downplays its excess,"(CNN) ""Long Live Rock ... Celebrate the Chaos"" exalts the communal nature of hard rock, while mostly glossing over its excesses. The new documentary also misses a seemingly obvious coda that would have resonated after a year of shuttered live events -- namely, the impact of Covid-19 on those who embrace this music with a level of adulation that one artist likens to Comic-Con every night.

Director Jonathan McHugh talks to an assortment of performers, from groups like Metallica, Korn and Rage Against the Machine, as well as experts and fans for whom hard rock is their passion. The last bracket includes a billing manager in Ohio with young kids -- who refers to festivals as ""my therapy"" -- a couple that has turned crowd-surfing into a shared activity, and another enthusiast who discusses temporarily losing her prosthetic limb while sailing across a sea of hands.

Still, the documentary gives away its lack of objectivity with the subtitle ""Celebrate the Chaos,"" reveling in the sense of escape derived from collisions within mosh pits, with nary a mention of the number of hospital visits such pastimes might generate.

Instead, the academics focus on the tribal nature of the fan base and feelings of community, describing the bruising physical aspects of the associated rituals as a rite of passage. The bodies slamming together in mosh pits or the ""wall of death"" are really ""a camaraderie thing,"" says Korn lead singer Jonathan Davis, a way for attendees to ""get their aggressions out."" And hey, as he notes, at least they're not letting off steam by playing golf.

The one darker side explored involves drug use and overdose deaths by prominent artists -- a relatively brief detour, in which Dr. Drew Pinsky (who built a reality-TV franchise around celebrity addiction) discusses the relationship between rock and chemical dependency.

'Raya and the Last Dragon' mixes a serious message with its animated action,"(CNN) The latest Disney animated adventure can be seen two ways: ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" offers another bold female lead from an underrepresented group and cute (in one case magical) sidekicks, embarking on a stirring quest. The deeper message, however, involves the toll that division and distrust inflicts on a mythical kingdom, which gives the otherwise pretty-good movie a rather timely hook.

Reading too much political subtext into this movie -- which hits theaters in addition to Disney+, like ""Mulan,"" at a premium fee -- won't be a problem for the kids watching it. Yet the adults who join them might find something deeper in the themes, in a film that's otherwise colorful, action-packed, and more than a little convoluted in setting up its premise.

Representing Disney animation's first Southeast Asian heroine, the Raya of the title (pronounced ""Rye-uh"") is as much a warrior as a princess, happily, voiced by Kelly Marie Tran of the recent ""Star Wars"" movies . She lays out the story in an opening narration, in which dragons fought off a threat 500 years earlier to the mythical kingdom of Kumandra, which subsequently split into five distinct lands.

Raya's father (Daniel Dae Kim) remained in possession of a gem that held the last vestiges of the dragons' magic, and dreamed of reuniting the kingdom. But those plans go awry, leaving a dystopian landscape that forces Raya to travel to each of the various lands -- wary as they are of each other -- to reunite the gem and restore harmony to their fractious world.

It's a lot to digest, including the dragon of the title, Sisu, voiced with Eddie Murphy-in-""Mulan""-like energy by Awkwafina. The dragon promotes the idea of trusting others, but Raya has a bit of history with the princess of the Fang lands, Namaari (""Crazy Rich Asians'"" Gemma Chan), who is every bit her equal in battle.

'One Night in Miami' packs a powerful dramatic punch,"(CNN) A fascinating historical meeting of the minds provides the foundation for Regina King's impressive feature film directorial debut in ""One Night in Miami,"" a creative extrapolation about Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown and Sam Cooke coming together in 1964. It's a small but riveting movie, anchored by a quartet of knockout performances.

Adapted by Kemp Powers from his play (he's having quite a year, having just co-directed Pixar's ""Soul""), the story hinges on Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir, who recently played Barack Obama in Showtime's ""The Comey Rule"" ) trying to recruit high-profile converts to Islam, using Ali (Eli Goree), then still Cassius Clay, as his point of entry.

The boxer has just won the heavyweight title when he and friends gather in a Florida hotel room. Rounding out the foursome are star NFL running back Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge) and crooner Sam Cooke (""Hamilton's"" Leslie Odom Jr.), who are skeptical about Malcolm X's pitch, if only because of what it would mean, they joke, about giving up porkchops and drinking.

What ensues is a timely conversation about the civil-rights struggle, the conflicting demands of celebrity, and the benefits and dangers associated with leveraging one's platform to speak out. That discussion has played out across the decades every time a singer, actor or athletes dares to venture into the world of activism.

""Strike with the weapon that you have: Your voice,"" Malcolm urges Cooke, who is well aware of fame's fickle nature, especially when crossing over to entertain White audiences.

'Minari' review: Steven Yeun stars in a movie that explores one family's American dream,"(CNN) ""Minari"" is a deeply personal film, and quality that's evident in writer-director Lee Isaac Chung's reminiscence about his childhood. Focusing on a Korean immigrant family, the universal themes come through loud, clear and ultimately with considerable power, even if the movie's languid pace works against it.

The title refers to a particularly durable crop, which is indicative of the resilience of this family, which has come to rural Arkansas seeking a better life.

The father (""The Walking Dead's"" Steven Yeun) has big dreams, having essentially bet everything on acquiring a mobile home and farming the adjacent land. He and his wife (Yeri Han) work in a nearby factory engaged in the tedious process of ""sexing"" chickens by day, and she's understandably skeptical about whether his drive and optimism will be enough to achieve his grand plan.

They also have a couple of kids, including a sensitive young son, David (Alan S. Kim), whose health problems provide another source of understandable concern. With both parents working to keep the lights on (literally, given their water-and-power issues), it's a relief when grandma (Youn Yuh Jung) comes to stay with them, even if her behavior isn't deemed maternal enough to satisfy the judgmental boy.

Playing a character who's foul-mouthed and frank, Youn comes pretty close to stealing the show, although the performances -- especially Han -- are strong across the board, among them Will Patton as an eccentric neighbor who winds up working for them.

The UAE's tiny lunar rover will face big challenges on the moon,"Dubai (CNN) Last month, the United Arab Emirates became the first country in the Arab world to put a spacecraft into orbit around Mars. But as it celebrates the achievement of its Hope probe, a group of Emirati scientists is already engaged in another historic feat: building a lunar rover.

The vehicle will be another regional first -- and it is smaller than any rover to have landed on the moon.

To date, China's 310-pound (140-kilogram) Yutu rovers are the lightest to have made lunar landings, in 2013 and 2019. But the UAE's will weigh less than a tenth of that. Around 20 inches (50 centimeters) long and wide, and 28 inches (70 centimeters) tall, it will weigh approximately 22 pounds (10 kilograms) with its payload.

Set to launch in 2024, the Emirates Lunar Mission aims to travel to a part of the moon that has never been reached by a rover. The exact landing site has not yet been revealed, but the objective is to better understand how lunar dust and rocks vary across the moon.

""If you think about the world and say that you visited 10 places, you can't say that you know the entire Earth -- so it's the same with the moon,"" says Sara Al Maeeni, a project scientist from the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center in Dubai. ""We're expecting to see new things at the new site, (and) understand more about airless bodies.""

The US, Russia and China are the only countries to have successfully landed a spacecraft on the lunar surface. In 2019, India's Chandrayaan-2 mission crash-landed there. Here you can see its rover on a ramp moving into the main vehicle, before launch.

Ships stranded in the Suez Canal will restart their journeys after the Ever Given anchors in the Great Bitter Lake, a Suez Canal Official told CNN on Monday.

""As soon as the ship reaches the waiting place in the Bitter Lakes…the 43 ships waiting in the Bitter Lakes will begin to move south towards the Gulf of Suez,” the source said.

The ships will be traveling in convoys northbound and southbound of the Suez Canal, as the Ever Given stands by for inspections.

The average number of ships that transited through the canal on a daily basis before the accident was between 80 to 90 ships, according to Lloyds List; however, the head of the Suez Canal Authority said that the channel will work 24 hours to facilitate the passage of almost 400 ships carrying billions of dollars in freight.

The journey to cross the canal takes 10 to 12 hours, and in the event the channel operates for 24 hours, two convoys per day will be able to successfully pass.

Still, shipping giant, Maersk issued an advisory telling customers it could take “6 days or more” for the queue created by the Suez Canal blockage to clear. The company said that was an estimate and subject to change as more vessels reach the blockage or are diverted.",2021-03-29 12:51:43+00:00
Barack Obama's step-grandmother and family matriarch 'Mama Sarah' dies in Kenya,"(CNN) Former US President Barack Obama's step-grandmother, Sarah Obama passed away Monday while receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment at a hospital in Kisumu, Western Kenya, authorities said in a statement.

""The passing away of Mama Sarah is a big blow to our nation. We've lost a strong, virtuous woman. A matriarch who held together the Obama family and was an icon of family values,"" said Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in a statement.

'Mama Sarah' as she was popularly known, was the third wife of the former US leader's paternal grandfather, Hussein Onyango Obama and helped raise the former president's father, Barack Sr.

President Obama called her 'Granny,' in his book 'Dreams from My Father,' and she rose to national prominence in 2006 after the then US senator visited Kenya.

"""I'm always chased away and victimized,"" says shopper told his traditional clothing is 'indecent' in South Africa mall","(CNN) A South African cultural activist says he is still reeling from the humiliation meted out to him for donning traditional attire to a shopping mall in a suburb of Johannesburg.

Maponyane had been seen in a video shared on social media Wednesday, asking Mahlangu to leave the mall for dressing ""indecently.""

Efforts to dislodge stranded Suez Canal container ship intensify as backlog grows,"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) Efforts to dislodge the huge container ship stuck in the Suez Canal intensified Saturday as the backlog of ships at either end of the crucial waterway grew, heightening concerns over the impact of the blockage on global supply chains .

The Ever Given, a container ship almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall, ran aground in the Egyptian canal on Tuesday after being caught in 40-knot winds and a sandstorm.

Since then, dredgers have been working to remove vast quantities of sand and mud from around the port side of the 224,000-ton vessel's bow.

A senior Suez Canal pilot told CNN the gigantic container ship could be dislodged by Saturday evening.

The pilot -- who is not authorized to speak to the media but works for the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) -- believes that several factors are now contributing to the anticipated success of the rescue operation including the near completion of the dredging work, the expected high tides and the availability of powerful tug boats.

High tide, expected at 10 p.m. local (4 p.m. ET), is an important factor in the rescue operation. Several other attempts over the past few days have failed.

A team of expert salvors from Dutch firm SMIT Salvage and Japan's Nippon Salvage -- who have worked on several high-profile operations in the past -- have been appointed to help the SCA re-float the ship, the charter company Evergreen Marine said in a statement.

Authorities say they have managed to remove almost 706,000 cubic feet of sand to free the Ever Given.

Asked if authorities had other plans in case of failure, the official told CNN: ""This is our only option now.""

Speaking at a news conference Saturday, SCA chairman Osama Rabie gave details of the rescue operation, which he described as ""technically difficult"" and ""involving many factors.""

""We are facing a difficult and complicated situation, we work in a rocky soil, the tides are very high, in addition to the huge size of the ship and the number of containers that make it difficult,"" he said. ""We cannot set a specific date for the ship to float, it depends on the ship's response.""

The ship was ""very responsive"" on Friday, leading to optimism that the job could be completed that night, he said. However, the operation had to be halted because of the tides.

Around 9,000 tons of ballast water have been removed from the ship, Rabie said, with the dredging taking place during low tides while 14 tugs worked during high tides. Rescue teams managed to temporarily restart the rudder and propellers on Friday night before a low tide stalled their efforts, he said.

In contrast to the pilot's comment, Rabie outlined another scenario that would require them to lighten the ship load by removing containers, a time-consuming and painstaking process to which they ""hopefully"" would not have to resort.

Around 321 ships are currently waiting to transit through the canal with no detours from inside the channel at this point, he said.

Rabie said the reasons behind the accident remain unclear. ""There are many factors or reasons, fast winds and the sandstorm could have been a reason but not the main reason -- it could have been a technical mistake or human error,"" he said. ""There will be further investigations.""

Rabie added that a number of countries including the United States, China, Greece and the United Arab Emirates had offered assistance in dislodging the ship.

The US Navy in the Middle East planned to send an assessment team of dredging experts to the Suez Canal as soon as Saturday to advise local authorities, according to two US defense officials.

The blockage, in what is one of the world's busiest and most important waterways, could have a major impact on already stretched global supply chains , with disruption escalating with each day that passes.

Pulling power

If the latest attempt to refloat the ship fails, the vessel -- which measures 400 meters (1,312 feet) long and 59 meters (193 feet) wide -- could still be freed by ""early next week,"" according to plans laid out by the head of a Dutch salvage company.

Peter Berdowski of Boskalis, a sister company of SMIT Salvage, told Dutch TV newscast ""Nieuwsuur"" on Friday that a more thorough investigation has shown that the ship's stern is ""not entirely pushed into the clay.""

That would allow heavy tug boats to take advantage of ""lever power"" by pulling at the stern, he said.

He said the hope was that their pulling power -- combined with the dredging work, a high tide of 40 to 50 centimeters next week, and the lever power of the ship's stern being relatively free -- would be enough ""to release the ship sometime early next week.""

If that fails, the next step would be removing up to 600 containers. ""In parallel, we are already mobilizing a crane,"" Berdowski said. ""This will also be delivered this weekend, which will enable us to remove containers from the front of the ship.""

His optimistic forecast will be welcome news to many. Shipping experts warned earlier this week that it could take days or even weeks to free the ship.

Fears for livestock

Meanwhile, billions of dollars' worth of vital cargo and sensitive products are backlogged on the hundreds of vessels whose way is blocked.

Maritime monitoring website Marine Traffic told CNN that 13 of the ships awaiting transit were carrying livestock, destined for different countries in Europe and Asia.

The EU director of NGO Animals International Gabriel Paun warned that thousands of animals being transported on the vessels -- mostly Romanian -- could be at risk of dying if the situation is not resolved in the next few days.

More ships carrying livestock are currently approaching the Suez Canal, Paun said.

""We are sitting in front of a major tragedy if the channel is not released in the next 24 hours because there are vessels that will run out of [livestock] food and water in the next two days,"" Paun said.

Some ships have food and water for six more days and ""if decide today to return to Romania, then they have a chance -- but if the blockade lasts between two and six more days we will have a disaster,"" Paun added.

One ship carrying livestock, the Nabolsi, has been sailing for 21 days after departing from Colombia on March 6, and is now awaiting passage by the blocked canal with animals on board, Marine Traffic spokesman Georgios Hatzimanolis said.

Rabie, of the SCA, said there were three boats with livestock in the canal, and that the Egyptian Ministry of Health had sent them animal feed and veterinarians.

Each day that passes comes at a high cost to companies and countries whose trade has been held up by the gridlock. About 12% of the world trade volume passes through the Suez Canal, and it usually handles about $10 billion a day in cargo.

More than 18,800 ships with a net tonnage of 1.17 billion tonnes passed through the canal during 2020. That's an average of 51.5 ships per day.

Dredgers work to free the stranded Ever Given container ship on Saturday.

Ships rerouting

At least 10 ships, including oil and LNG tankers and container ships, had rerouted away from the canal as of Friday, according to Marine Traffic and data intelligence firm Kpler.

""There are already now multiple ships ... bypassing [the route from the Mediterranean into the canal] and are now going south ... it is the right point in time to make that decision,"" said Lars Jensen, the head of Sea Intelligence Consulting, a firm provides consultancy to the shipping industry.

The Indian government on Friday said it had advised its shipping lines to explore the option of rerouting of ships via the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, according to a statement from the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

It noted that such rerouting usually takes 15 additional days.

This Suez Canal route is used by Indian exporters and importers for trade worth $200 billion with North America, South America and Europe, the statement said. The ministry added that it would identify and prioritize perishable cargo for movement.

Even before the Ever Given ran aground, global supply chains were being stretched to the limits, making it much more expensive to move goods around the world. A prolonged closure of the key route between Asia, Europe and North America would only make matters worse.

Discussing the issue of potential damages claims, Toshiaki Fujiwara, senior managing director of Shoei Kisen KK, the ship's owner, said Friday that ""the company has not received any claims at this point,"" adding that ""it may take one [to] two or several years to come up with those details.""

Evergreen Marine, the Taiwanese company which operates the Ever Given, has claimed that Shoei Kisen KK bears responsibility for the accident, Fujiwara confirmed.",2021-03-27 00:00:00
Egypt train crash: More than 30 killed in Sohag governorate as trains collide,"Cairo (CNN) At least 32 people have been killed and 165 injured after two trains collided in Egypt on Friday, according to government statements.

Seventy-two ambulances were sent to the scene and reinforcement medical teams were sent to the incident in the Tahta district of the Upper Egypt governorate of Sohag from the capital Cairo, the Health Ministry said.

Health Minister Hala Zayed said in a news conference that two planes were dispatched from Cairo with 52 medical teams from various specialties on board to treat the injured.

Images from the scene showed crowds of people gathered around the twisted wreckage of the trains.

The collision happened after an unidentified person pulled an emergency brake, Egypt's railway authority said in a statement.

"Dozens unaccounted for in Mozambique after Islamist attack, rights groups say","Maputo, Mozambique (CNN) Heavy fighting continued into Saturday around the northern town of Palma in Mozambique, which was attacked by Islamist insurgents on Wednesday, according to multiple sources contacted by CNN.

Thousands of people have fled Palma after the attack on Wednesday, according to human rights groups, while the fate of dozens of people who had taken refuge in a local hotel remains unclear.

Witnesses reported seeing bodies in the streets after the insurgents, believed to be affiliated with the terrorist group ISIS , attacked Palma from three directions, Human Rights Watch said on Saturday.

The town is close to a large liquefied natural gas project run by the French company Total. The attack came hours after the Mozambican government and Total announced a resumption of operations at the vast Afungi project north of Palma, where work had been suspended since January after a series of insurgent attacks.

Video from Thursday obtained by CNN shows helicopters flown by military contractors deployed by the government passing over a hotel lodge an apparent effort to secure an escape corridor for dozens of people who had fled there as the attack unfolded.

Among the people visible in the video from the hotel compound, at least 20 appeared to be foreign workers.

In another video obtained by a CNN, a Mozambican who was also trapped in the hotel described the situation as ""critical,"" saying ""we don't have food, we only have water.""

In the video recorded Thursday, he said: ""We have been under attack since yesterday ... We've been under cross-fire for 24 hours.

""We don't know how we're going to get out of here. We're going to be evacuated but we don't know when, at what time, how and by whom,"" he added.

""The helicopters are circling the area of the Amarula Hotel to be sure that the roads are free to get to the beach but as you can hear, we don't know if this will be possible. The situation is critical. We don't have food. We only have water."" Helicopters could be heard in the background as he spoke.

Unknown if insurgents still control Palma

At least some people were evacuated by land on Friday in convoys as the helicopters circled above. One Mozambican who had been at the hotel described the situation in Palma as ""complete chaos.""

According to multiple reports, at least one convoy was attacked as it tried to reach Pemba to the south. The Portuguese news agency LUSA reported that seven people were killed, without providing further details.

One company operating in the area, African Century Real Estate, said it had managed to evacuate 19 workers and four guests from a property southwest of Palma on Saturday morning ""under heavy fire."" The company said it was continuing efforts to ""locate the remaining members of our team.""

""The village of Palma remains without communications since the beginning of the attacks, so it is premature to make a real assessment of the situation,"" the company said.

The Portuguese Foreign Ministry confirmed that one of its nationals was injured in a rescue operation from the region, the Portuguese news agency LUSA reported on Saturday.

In a statement Saturday, the South African government said it noted ""with grave concern"" that South Africans were affected by the attacks. It said its diplomatic mission in the capital, Maputo, was being reinforced to help identify and locate those affected.

A journalist working with CNN in Mozambique said at least some of those trapped were able to reach the town of Pemba in a convoy on Friday.

Dewa Mavhinga, southern Africa director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said the militants had ""fired on civilians in their homes and on the streets in Palma, as they tried to flee for their lives.""

HRW said it reached several civilians by phone before communications with the town were cut on Thursday.

It quoted one witness as saying that ""People were running and shouting 'Al-Shabaab is here ... It's Al-Shabaab ... They're killing everybody.""

The insurgents are known locally as ""Shabaab"" but have no links to the Somali group of the same name. The full name of the group is Ahl al-Sunnah wa al Jamma'ah (ASWJ), and it formally joined the Islamic State's self-declared Central Africa Province last year. Earlier this month, the US designated the group a terror organization under the name ""ISIS-Mozambique.""

Two hotel workers told HRW that armed men had fired at people and buildings, including the hotel.

An audio recording received by CNN from someone at the hotel on Thursday included the sound of heavy gunfire.

Mozambique's Defense Ministry said on Thursday that an army operation to restore security in Palma was underway but has provided no further updates.

'Meticulous planning' by insurgents

It's unknown if the insurgents still control the town. On Friday, a senior security source with direct knowledge of the events told CNN that the militants in Mozambique were likely still operating in the area.

The source said that fierce fighting between the insurgents and Mozambican forces and police lasted for hours, with private contractors providing helicopter air engagement to push insurgent forces out of the center of town.

The insurgents attacked military and police installations and robbed two banks in the town overnight Wednesday and set them alight, said the source.

Jasmine Opperman, a security analyst who writes a weekly digest of events in Cabo Delgado said the attack had demonstrated ""meticulous planning"" by the insurgents.

Even before the assault on Palma, the town was inaccessible by road because of insecurity along the route south, leading to food shortages in the area.

Alexandre Raymakers, Senior Africa Analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNN that the assault on Palma was a ""major setback for the government, especially after Total announcement, and seriously brings into question their ability to secure LNG projects vital for the country's long term financial prosperity.""

Raymakers said that ""Total's decision to resume construction was contingent on Maputo guaranteeing a 25 kilometer security perimeter around the Afungi peninsula, which would include Palma.""

In August last year, ASWJ staged a large-scale assault on the port of Mocimboa da Praia, and continue to occupy the area despite government efforts to retake it.

ASWJ has made large parts of Mozambique's most northern province, Cabo Delgado, inaccessible and insecure as its attacks have grown in reach and sophistication since 2017.

Raymakers says that ""ASWJ's war-fighting capacity, command and control, and overall confidence has grown enormously in the last year. ""

The fighting between the group and government forces has left more than 1,500 civilians dead and displaced more than 600,000, according to HRW.",2021-03-27 00:00:00
"Kenya orders closure of two refugee camps, gives ultimatum to UN agency","(CNN) Kenya on Wednesday ordered the closure of two sprawling camps that host hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring Somalia and gave the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) two weeks to present a plan to do so, the interior ministry said.

The Dadaab and the Kakuma refugee camps in northern Kenya together host more than 410,000 people, a small proportion of whom are from South Sudan.

Authorities in Nairobi first announced their intention to shut the Dadaab camp, which is closer to the border with Somalia than Kakuma, back in 2016, citing national security concerns.

Fred Matiang'i, the interior minister, has now given the UNHCR 14 days to draw up a plan for the closure of both Dadaab and Kakuma, his ministry said in a tweet, adding that there was no room for further talks on the issue.

UNHCR urged Kenya to ensure that those who need protection continue to get it, and pledged to keep engaging in a dialogue.

Niger mourns 137 victims after deadliest attack in recent memory,"(CNN) Flags flew at half-staff and Koranic verses played on state media on Tuesday as Niger began observing three days of national mourning for the 137 victims of coordinated raids on villages in the southwest.

The killings on Sunday represented Niger's worst civilian carnage in recent memory, surpassing an attack by suspected militants in January that killed at least 100 villagers and another last week that killed at least 58.

The scale of the violence this year has called into question claims of progress in the fight against Islamist militants by governments in West Africa's Sahel region and former colonial power France, which has 5,000 troops there to support them.

A security source blamed Sunday's attacks, which were carried out by men on motorbikes in the remote Tahoua region near the border with Mali, on the local Islamic State affiliate. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for previous raids against security forces and French aid workers.

Niger only finished a period of mourning for the previous attacks on Friday.

Africa's second coronavirus wave was much worse than the first,"(CNN) The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has hit Africa much harder than the first wave, a new analysis has shown.

Daily new infections across the continent were approximately 30% higher during the second wave, according to the study published in The Lancet journal. Its authors say it is the first comprehensive continent-wide analysis of the pandemic in Africa.

The data showed that while an average of 18,273 daily new cases were being reported across the continent during the first peak of the epidemic in mid-July, this number rose to an average of 23,790 by the end of December when 36 of the African Union's 55 states had experienced or were experiencing a second wave

Dr. John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and one of the authors of the study, said the more aggressive second wave was likely caused by several factors, including a lower adherence to health measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, as well as the emergence of the new, more infectious variants

""These insights also reveal a need to improve testing capacity and reinvigorate public health campaigns, to re-emphasize the importance of abiding by measures that aim to strike a fine balance between controlling the spread of Covid-19 and sustaining economies and people's livelihoods,"" he added in a statement.

However, Nkengasong told CNN public health measures alone will not be enough to stop further waves of the pandemic in Africa. ""Without urgent scale-up of the vaccines, we will definitely see the third wave, which has already started in some African countries,"" he said.

""Vaccines protectionism will definitely make the situation worse, and ... will be detrimental to the global efforts to win the battle against Covid 19,"" he added.

African countries are lagging behind the rest of the world in vaccination rollouts , because the majority of countries on the continent have not yet received any vaccine deliveries.

African countries are largely relying on the COVAX scheme, a global vaccine-sharing initiative that provides discounted or free doses for lower-income countries. The supply is very limited, though. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 90 million doses will be provided to Africa in the first half of this year. That's enough to immunize just 3% of the continent's population. As more vaccines become available, the aim is to vaccinate at least 20% by the end of the year, WHO said.

In comparison, the United States is planning to make vaccines available to all adults by May 1 . The United Kingdom has already vaccinated more than half of all adults and is aiming to offer the vaccine to everyone by the end of July. The European Union said Wednesday it wants to vaccinate 70% of its citizens by the end of summer.

Several countries hit very hard

The study said that while case numbers and deaths in Africa as a whole were still low compared to many other parts of the world, several countries had experienced very high infection rates.

Of the nearly 3 million Covid-19 cases and more than 65,000 deaths reported in Africa between mid February 2020 and the end of the year, more than 82% were reported in just nine countries. South Africa was the hardest hit, with more than 38% of all African cases reported there. Morocco saw nearly 16% of all cases while Tunisia, Egypt and Ethiopia reported around 5% of total cases each.

Cape Verde, South Africa and Libya were the three countries that reported the highest cumulative incidence rates, while 18 of the 55 states reported higher case fatality ratio than the global average, meaning a higher proportion of those officially diagnosed with Covid-19 have died.

The authors of the study said that early intervention in many African countries kept the first wave of the pandemic relatively under control.

Writing for CNN last year , Yale economist Mushfiq Mubarak said the experience of dealing with prior epidemics prompted several African leaders to react quickly.

Senegal, Rwanda, Mauritius and Liberia began planning their response as soon as the virus alerts were sent internationally and began screening and quarantining travelers at the airport. Ghana and Nigeria banned travel between cities and implemented curfews.

Mubarak added that many African countries also focused on expanding testing and contact tracing very early in the pandemic. Senegal built infrastructure that allowed coronavirus test results to be generated within 24 hours. Rwanda and Sierra Leone repurposed their HIV and Ebola equipment for coronavirus tracking, testing, and quarantining. South Africa, Cameroon, Mauritania, Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal, and parts of Nigeria have set up large-scale community door-to-door campaigns to test, treat, and isolate potential Covid patients.

Looking at the 50 states for which data about public health and social measures were available, the researchers found that 36 put stringent restrictions in place on average 15 days before reporting their first case. The other 14 countries implemented them on average just nine days after their first coronavirus case -- which is still much earlier than many other countries around the world.

The vast majority of the countries had five of more measures in place, including international travel controls, schools closures and bans on public events and mass gatherings.

However, the researchers found that even though the second wave of the epidemic was more severe, it led to fewer and less stringent public health measures. They said in order to prevent further waves of the coronavirus pandemic from becoming even worse, African leaders need to double down on public health measures and work to improve their testing capacities.",2021-03-24 00:00:00
Did Tanzania's Covid-denying leader die of the coronavirus? It's one of many questions he leaves behind,"(CNN) President John Magufuli , the Covid-denying leader of Tanzania, was said to have died from heart failure, which he apparently battled for more than a decade, according to the country's new president .

Samia Suluhu Hassan said Magufuli had been receiving treatment in a Tanzanian hospital when he died on Wednesday evening.

However, opposition leaders insist Magufuli died of Covid-19 at least one week earlier.

Tundu Lissu, of the Chadema opposition party, said in an interview with a Kenyan broadcaster Thursday that Magufuli had died from Covid in early March.

""Magufuli died of corona,"" Lissu said, citing ""credible government sources.""

""I received news of President Magufuli's passing without any surprise,"" he added.

""I had expected this all along, from the first day I tweeted on March 7... when I asked the question 'Where is President Magufuli and what is his state of health?' I had information from very credible sources in the government that the president was gravely ill with Covid-19 and his situation was actually very bad,"" Lissu said from his base in Belgium. CNN has contacted Lissu for further comment.

CNN has been unable to independently verify his claims. Tanzanian authorities also did not respond to calls for comment on Lissu's claims.

Magufuli was last seen in public on February 27, fueling intense speculation about his health. Officials, however, insisted he was healthy.

""Tanzanians should be at peace. Your president is around, thanks for voting strongly for him recently. He is healthy, working hard, planning for the country,"" Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa was quoted as saying in local media March 12.

The secrecy and mystery shrouding his death is telling about Magufuli's enduring legacy, says Maria Sarungi Tsehai, activist and founder of the #ChangeTanzania movement, a civil society group promoting free speech.

Tsehai said that the circumstances of his death and the ""secrecy and intimidation"" that citizens face for speculating or discussing it is ""very telling about the kind of presidency he ran.""

""Even now in his death, people are still terrified and talking in hushed tones,"" Tsehai said.

Magufuli was Tanzania's fifth president and part of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party that has ruled the country since independence in 1961.

Now that he is gone, Tanzania is left in flux. Many believe the country is fighting a virulent second wave of Covid. However, the reports are largely anecdotal as Tanzania stopped reporting Covid data to global health authorities, such as the World Health Organization

The last reported figures of 509 cases and 21 deaths were in April last year.

Magufuli frustrated global health leaders after he suspended nationwide tracking of Covid cases -- blaming the country's infection toll on defective test kits.

, a goat, and sheep -- using imported Covid-19 test kits -- returned positive test results for the virus when sent to the country's laboratory, whose handlers were reportedly unaware of the source of the samples. Last May, he claimed that non-human samples which were randomly collected from a pawpawa goat, and sheep -- using imported Covid-19 test kits -- returned positive test results for the virus when sent to the country's laboratory, whose handlers were reportedly unaware of the source of the samples.

Magufuli's death has raised many questions about how the country moves forward in a pandemic with a massive information vacuum.

Magufuli made no bids for Covid vaccines as he queried its safety and instead promoted the use of prayers, herbal treatments and steam inhalation to combat the disease.

Tsehai says the lack of information makes it difficult for healthcare workers and citizens to know what the real situation is. Her organization ran an informal survey to get a ""snapshot"" of the Covid situation in the country last year.

There is no official data on #coronavirus in #Tanzania

Activists at @ChangeTanzania are attempting to get a snapshot through an informal online survey! The government has COMPLETELY failed this nation - no data, no public awareness - people are dying! https://t.co/UXB0BTnt3a — Maria Sarungi Tsehai (@MariaSTsehai) February 18, 2021

""We are seeing more obituaries, death announcements, and that more people are leaving us. There are elderly people and those in their 50s. Parents are also telling us that children are being admitted to hospital with breathing problems,"" she said.

However, changes are far from imminent, added Tsehai. ""Nothing will happen immediately. We have to wait and see what Samia (Hassan) can do.""

On Friday, Hassan was sworn in as the country's first female president.

Now, the new leader needs to select a vice presidential candidate and form a cabinet, Tsehai said.

""We are very worried. She needs to act now. The ceremony and burial and last rites ceremony are going to be Covid super spreader events,"" Tsehai added.

Fighting Covid with prayers

Magufuli was devoutly religious and a rabid Covid-19 denier who repeatedly downplayed the severity of Covid-19 in Tanzania, while declaring the country free from the virus last June after three days of mass prayers.

He refused to close churches, called on citizens to join more mass prayer days and described the virus as ""satanic.""

""Let's pray and fast for three days I am sure we will win... today for the Muslims who have already begun, tomorrow the Seventh Day Adventists who pray on Saturdays and on Sunday for Christians,"" Magufuli said on February 19.

""God has never forsaken this nation. We won last year and graduated to middle-income status amid coronavirus,"" he added.

Deus Valentine Rweyemamu, who heads the Center for Strategic Litigation, a pro-democracy movement in Tanzania, told CNN that Magufuli failed to provide leadership in his handling of the pandemic.

""President Magufuli hid behind religious fundamentalism and managed to sway an entire nation into denialism. His only recorded public address on Covid has half of it made up of Bible verses,"" Rweyemamu said.

However, religious leaders were among his fiercest critics.

Father Charles Kitima, Secretary of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference, a group of Catholic bishops, told CNN Thursday that the Magufuli regime did not take urgent steps in handling the coronavirus.

Kitima, who had been a vocal critic of Tanzania's Covid response under Magufuli, said some members of the Catholic Church in Tanzania may have died from Covid-related complications.

""Some members of the church had breathing complications and died out of that,"" he told CNN.

""As for the months from mid-December 2020 to February 2021, we lost 25 priests and 60 nuns... Some of these died because of breathing difficulties,"" he said.

He added that the volume of infections in the country could not be ascertained due to the lack of testing.

Kitima faulted Magufuli's Covid response, which relied largely on religion while neglecting scientific recommendations.

""You cannot separate prayer from science. Religion is there to support the doctors and researchers. Science and faith must work together,"" Kitima told CNN.

Rweyemamu told CNN that many Tanzanians trusted Magufuli's -- albeit unconventional -- methods.

""If President Magufuli were to appear in public wearing a mask then even Tanzania's sickest dog would wear one. This is because... Tanzanians believe in their president more than in their own parents,"" he added.

Mussa Khamis, a project officer at Good Neighbors, a non-profit humanitarian organization in Tanzania, told CNN: ""While some of my friends and relatives inhaled steam to fight this pandemic... I took care of myself by observing prevention measures advised by WHO and other medical experts.""

The 26-year-old resident of Tanzania's semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar said the existence of Covid-19 had begun to resonate with many Tanzanians following the passing of Zanzibar's Vice President, Seif Sharif Hamad, who died in February after contracting the virus.

Hamad was open about his illness, which he made public three weeks before his death.

""People now wear masks and wash their hands frequently. I think this is motivated by the recent loss of our vice president,"" Khamis said.

The end of the Magufuli era is expected to usher in a new national perspective on Covid-19.

However, it remains to be seen if it will be business as usual for Tanzania's new leader or if she will change tack and make room for science to thrive as the pandemic rages.",2021-03-20 00:00:00

COVAX offers hope of vaccine equality with roll out across Africa,"(CNN) When Covid-19 vaccinations arrived in Kenya for the very first time this week, the country's health minister likened them to critical weapons of defense.

""We have been fighting this virus, but we have been fighting it with rubber bullets,"" said Kenya's Minister of Health Mutahi Kagwe. ""But what we have received here is equivalent, metaphorically speaking, to acquisition of machine guns, bazookas, and tanks to fight this war against Covid-19.""

Kenya received the initial shipment of just over 1 million doses Tuesday through the COVAX program, a global vaccine-sharing initiative to reduce vaccine inequality with discounted or free doses for lower-income countries.

Weeks after many wealthier nations began receiving their first doses, COVAX got underway last week starting with a delivery to Ghana. Days later, the country's president became the first to publicly get vaccinated through the program.

""It's important that I set the example that this vaccine is safe by being the first to have it,"" Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said Monday, as he kicked off a country-wide vaccine drive.

Western countries have 'hoarded' Covid vaccines. Africa is being left behind as cases surge,"(CNN) African nations are being left behind in obtaining Covid-19 vaccines as richer countries stockpile vaccines and prioritize their own populations -- despite a surge in cases and a new variant affecting the continent.

On Monday, South Africa took delivery of its first million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, with another 500,000 expected later this month . It will begin inoculating health workers in February, the health ministry told CNN, becoming one of the first countries in Africa to receive large doses of the Covid-19 vaccines.

South Africa has also ordered another 20 million vaccines through a deal with Pfizer/BioNTech and expects to purchase another 9 million from Johnson & Johnson, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told a local media channel on Monday.

Workers load South Africa's first Covid-19 vaccines as they arrive at OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg on February 1

Seychelles was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to start vaccinating its population, using doses of China's Sinopham vaccine -- with a target to be the first to have 70% coverage among adults, according to a media release.

The island of Mauritius also started vaccinating frontline workers on January 26 , after India donated 100,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines.

In December, Guinea, in West Africa, ordered 55 doses of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine and gave the first doses to 25 officials, according to The Associated Press

In North Africa, Morocco and Algeria also recently began immunization programs, according to Our World in Data , an independent statistics website from Oxford University's Global Change Data Lab.

In comparison to other regions, Africa was slow to start and is likely to be slow in catching up, health officials said.

Emerging markets like South Africa have also found themselves paying more than their wealthier counterparts.



Paying double

South Africa is the country worst affected by Covid-19 in Africa, recording nearly 1.5 million cases to date and more than 45,000 deaths. Its health ministry told CNN global competition forced it to purchase the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine from the Serum Institute of India (SII) at nearly double the price -- $5.25 per dose, according to Reuters -- paid by other wealthier countries.

""There is a global demand for the vaccine in the first quarter. We are not aware of a cheaper option that is immediately available,"" the health ministry's head of communications, Popo Maja, said.

The SII did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

This price is higher than the $3 per dose other African countries are reportedly set to pay in a deal the African Union (AU) secured two weeks ago. That order promises 270 million doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for African countries, again through the SII.

But few cheap vaccine options are available to African countries because of continued global demand, leaving the continent trailing behind, say government officials and health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO).

Making their own deals

Most African countries suffered fewer deaths from the first wave of the virus last year compared to other parts of the world, but case numbers are now surging across the continent, particularly in the southern region.

The African continent has recorded more than 3.6 million cases, while deaths increased by 40% since January 1 to reach 92,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

South Africa is also dealing with a new variant of the virus that emerged there, which health experts say is possibly more transmissible and capable of evading the effect of vaccines . It is driving record case numbers and has been detected in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Comoros, and Zambia as well as more than 20 non-African countries so far.

""If we don't manage the situation we will end up with a moral catastrophe in our hands,"" the head of Africa's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told CNN last week. ""If we have those vaccines and we continue to apply aggressively the public health measures, the issue of variants would disappear.""

Last year, WHO set up the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a partnership to coordinate production and boost access to treatments, vaccines and tests.

COVAX, the ACT Accelerator's vaccines branch, aims to distribute 2 billion Covid-19 doses globally by the end of this year, with 690 million forecast for Africa's lower-income countries.

The initiative is led by WHO; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. It will be funded by development agencies and donations from groups such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

If Gavi's supply forecast is correct, the countries will only have enough to fully vaccinate 27% of their combined population, James Fulker, a spokesperson for Gavi, told CNN.

WHO is asking richer countries to prioritize fair supply instead of making their own extensive deals with pharmaceutical companies or else share their unused doses with COVAX.

At the same time, the health agency is encouraging poorer countries to secure additional coverage through their own deals.

The AU has also taken the lead in seeking out deals for its member countries, by setting up the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT).

Last week, AVATT procured 400 million doses from the SII, adding to the 270 million secured in January, Nkengasong said.

Anger against vaccine nationalism

The global disparity in access to Covid-19 vaccines has caused widespread anger among Africa's leaders, including South Africa's president and chair of the AU, Cyril Ramaphosa, who warned during a World Economic Forum virtual meeting last week that richer countries are ""hoarding"" vaccines, and urged global action to ensure an equitable rollout.

""We are concerned about vaccine nationalism,"" Ramaphosa said. ""The rich countries of the world went out and acquired large doses of vaccines from the developers and manufacturers of these vaccines and some countries have even gone beyond and acquired up to four times what their population needs.""

For example, Canada and the United Kingdom have purchased enough vaccines to cover 500% and 300% of their populations respectively, according to data from the Duke Global Health Innovation Center

A patient receives an injection of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at a centre in the UK which has enough vaccines to cover 300% of its population

This behavior is marginalizing the countries that are ""most in need"" of the vaccine, Ramaphosa added.

WHO has echoed Ramaphosa's words on several occasions, stating recently that the vaccine gap between rich and poor countries is widening.

National rollouts

But countries in sub-Saharan Africa are working with what they can to get some coverage underway.

Ghana is planning to procure 17.6 million doses of different vaccines by June, its President, Nana Akufo Addo, said while announcing new restrictions in a speech on Sunday. The West African nation of 30 million is fighting a second wave, with nearly 67,000 cases reported and a record daily total of 1,583 cases on Sunday.

In East Africa, Kenya will begin vaccinating this month and hopes to have 1.25 million people inoculated before June, according to its health ministry on Friday.

Uganda, with a population of around 44 million, plans to access vaccines through COVAX and its health ministry has said it will try to procure more from AstraZeneca It is also exploring the possibility of getting vaccines from China, if WHO approves its vaccine.

In Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, officials say they will begin to receive vaccine doses this month through COVAX. The health minister, Osagie Enanire, is also working with the AU to secure vaccines from its deal.

The country has been grappling with a shortage of oxygen and rising case numbers. Nigeria will receive 16 million doses in COVAX's initial distribution, the third most of any country globally.

The value of sharing

Despite the progress made, African countries on the whole face a long wait in receiving Covid-19 vaccines. For example, less than 20% of the 270 million doses first ordered by the AU will be available before June, according to a press release from the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team.

COVAX forecasts that by that time it will have supplied 640 million doses, about 30% of which are for AU countries, Fulker said.

In contrast, the European Union expects member states to vaccinate 70% of their adult populations by the summer.

""It is in their common interest, in the collective interest that people get vaccinated in a timely fashion all over so that we can get out of this pandemic as a collective,"" Nkengasong told CNN. ""There's no way only parts of the world like the richer nations will get out of this without the southern hemisphere also getting out of the pandemic.""

In his opening remarks at the 148th session of the WHO executive board on January 18, its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyses, said the approach of first world countries was ""self-defeating.""

The development and approval of safe and effective vaccines less than a year after the emergence of a new virus is providing a much-needed source of hope. The challenge we face now is to ensure vaccines are a source of HOPE FOR ALL, not hope for some. #COVID19 — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) February 1, 2021

""Until we end the Covid-19 pandemic everywhere, we won't end it anywhere. As we speak, rich countries are rolling out vaccines, while the world's least-developed countries watch & wait,"" he added at a media briefing on January 25.

Ghebreyses wants vaccination to be underway in every country within the first 100 days of 2021, but this may be an ambitious target when many countries in Africa have yet to receive vaccines and may not for some weeks.

""Time is short, and the stakes could not be higher; every moment counts,"" he said.",2021-02-05 00:00:00
Why the Suez Canal is so important -- and why its blockage could be so damaging,"(CNN) Since it was completed in 1869, the Suez Canal has been one of the world's most important bodies of water; a portal between East and West that has been controlled by multiple countries, threatened to ignite war, and become a bedrock of the global economy.

But the mammoth container ship that has lodged itself across the waterway poses a very modern problem: About a tenth of global trade passes through the Suez Canal, and it could be facing a weeks-long blockage.

Workers are continuing to clear sand and mud away from the Ever Given, a 224,000-ton vessel that ran aground after 40-knot winds and a sandstorm caused low visibility and poor navigation.

The speed with which they can shift the ship, which is as about long as the Empire State Building is tall, carries significance around the world -- and is a unique challenge even in the eventful history of the Suez.

Why is the Suez Canal so important?

The importance of the canal stems first and foremost from its location; it is the only place that directly connects the waters of Europe with the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the countries of the Asia-Pacific.

Without the Suez, shipments traveling between those parts of the world would have to traverse the entire continent of Africa, adding hefty costs and substantially extending their journey times.

A solution to that problem appeared elusive for centuries, until the precious 120-mile waterway was constructed to slither down Egypt and into the Red Sea. It was built over the course of a decade in the mid-19th century -- a feat only possible because the Mediterranean and Red Seas were found to be roughly level in altitude.

A cargo ship navigates in the Suez Canal, past the port authority building of Port Said, in 2008. The passageway hosts nearly 19,000 vessels each year.

The time saved by the passage is almost invaluable. Today, a ship traveling from a port in Italy to India, for instance, would cover around 4,400 nautical miles if it passed through the Suez Canal -- a journey that, at a speed of 20 knots, would take about nine days.

But the second-quickest way to complete that same journey would be via the Cape of Good Hope and around Africa. At the same speed, it would take three weeks to traverse the route, which is 10,500 nautical miles long.

Adding to its importance is that there are no alternatives to the Suez; were it not for the Red Sea stretching up above the Horn of Africa and along Sudan and Egypt, no land masses would be narrow enough to support an artificial waterway that links Europe with the Asia-Pacific.

The canal's strategically important position now means it hosts nearly 19,000 vessels each year, according to Lloyd's List, a shipping industry journal.

What is its history?

A passageway connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas had been longed for by nation states for centuries, and the canal's importance was clear long before construction began.

Instigated by French interests and exploration, the Suez was built over the course of 10 years by local peasants drafted and forced into labor, and European workers who later joined the effort.

Financial troubles forced the Ottoman governor of Egypt to sell a controlling stake in the waterway to Britain in 1875; 13 years later, a multinational summit resulted in an agreement that the canal would be free for all countries to use, both in peace and war.

Its positioning made it a flashpoint in both of the 20th century's major conflicts; in World War I, Turkish forces tried to attack the canal from the east, and in World War II, the Nazis' Afrika Korps aimed to do the same from the west.

But the canal remained under British control until Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized it in 1956, sparking the Suez Crisis that drew threats of invasion from Israel, France and Great Britain. The episode threatened to cause war, until pressure from the US and diplomatic efforts from the nascent United Nations forced a solution.

The Suez has been shut down before; for eight years from 1967 it became a border between a warring Egypt and Israel, a conflict that left more than a dozen ships -- known as the Yellow Fleet -- trapped in the canal for the duration.

What happens now?

Dislodging the Ever Given, which is currently blocking the waterway, could take ""days to weeks, depending on what you come across,"" according to the CEO of Boskalis, whose sister company SMIT salvage is now working to free the ship.

Peter Berdowski told Dutch television on Wednesday night that his company had already determined that it would be impossible to free the ship as it currently is. ""The ship with the weight that it now has is impossible to pull,"" he said. ""You can forget about that.""

That spells trouble for world trade. Leading shipping insurer Allianz has said ships ""face costly and lengthy deviations if the canal is not opened soon."" Diverting vessels via the southern tip of Africa would add roughly two weeks to their journeys.

Ships blocked from getting through the Suez Canal wait in Great Bitter Lake on Thursday.

Several ships are nonetheless already choosing to detour away from the blocked canal, marine traffic monitoring websites and shipping data intelligence firms are reporting.

Even before the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal earlier this week, global supply chains were being stretched to the limits, making it much more expensive to move goods around the world and causing shortages of everything from exercise bikes to cheese at a time of unprecedented demand.

More than 80% of global trade by volume is moved by sea, and disruptions are adding billions of dollars to supply chain costs. Globally, the average cost to ship a 40-foot container shot up from $1,040 last June to $4,570 on March 1, according to S&P Global Platts.

It remains unclear whether and how severely the blockage of the canal will affect consumers. But Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients on Friday that the episode could cause oil to become more expensive for consumers because of higher tanker rates as a result of the incident.",2021-03-26 00:00:00
Syria forced to ration fuel as stricken ship keeps Suez Canal blocked,"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) The paralyzing effect of the stricken Ever Given container ship on global traffic became clear on Sunday as nearby Syria, already scarred by years of war, imposed fuel rationing to safeguard dwindling oil supplies.

Suez Canal officials hoped that high tide and dredging efforts could see the giant ship freed on Saturday night, four days after it ran aground. But despite progressin loosening the bow and freeing the rudder and propeller, the vessel remains wedged across the canal.

Dredging efforts continued Sunday, according to Ever Given's operator, Evergreen Marine, with attempts to refloat the vessel due to resume from 2 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET).

Meanwhile, the backlog of ships waiting in the area has grown to 327, according to Leth Agencies, the canal's service provider. Of those, 151 are on the canal, 42 are at the midway point of Great Bitter Lake, and 134 are at Port Said, which connects to the Mediterranean Sea.

Syria's Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources said the blockage of the Suez Canal had ""hindered the oil supplies to Syria and delayed arrival of a tanker carrying oil and oil derivations to Syria,"" state-run SANA news reported.

Amid fears over fuel supplies, the Middle Eastern nation has been forced to ration ""the available quantities of petroleum derivatives mainly diesel and benzene to ensure their vital availability for the longest possible time,"" SANA said Saturday.

The step has been taken ""in order to guarantee the continued supply of basic services to Syrians such as bakeries, hospitals, water stations, communication centers, and other vital institutions,"" according to SANA, citing the ministry.

Syria will continue to ration oil supplies until ""the return of normal movement of the navigation via the Suez Canal, which may take an unknown time,"" it added.

The Ever Given, a huge ship almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall, ran aground in the Egyptian canal on Tuesday after being caught in 40-knot winds and a sandstorm. Authorities are also investigating possible human or technical errors.

The blockage, in what is one of the world's busiest and most important waterways, could have a major impact on already stretched global supply chains, with disruption escalating with each day that passes.

A team of expert salvors from Dutch firm SMIT Salvage and Japan's Nippon Salvage -- who have worked on several high-profile operations in the past -- has been appointed to help the Suez Canal Authoriity re-float the ship, the charter company Evergreen Marine said.

Dredgers have been working to extract vast quantities of sand and mud from around the port side of the 224,000-ton vessel's bow.

""Having removed more than 20,000 tons of sand and mud, the dredging operation underway has succeeded in loosening the Ever Given's bow within the bank of the Suez Canal and the ship's stern has been cleared from the sand bank,"" Evergreen Marine said in an update Sunday.

""The rudder and propeller of the vessel are fully functional and expected to provide additional support to tugboats assigned to move the container ship from the accident site so that normal transit may again resume within the canal.""

The head of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, said in a live phone interview Sunday with Egypt's Extra News television channel that the Ever Given had shifted slightly on Saturday.

""We managed to move the ship from the bow side by 4 meters, and likewise from the stern side,"" Rabie said. ""The dredging operations led to the ship moving, albeit a slight move, but it is a positive development, because in the first two days the ship was not moving at all.""

Egypt is also making preparations so that if a decision to unload containers from the ship is made -- currently the third-case scenario -- there would be no further delay, Rabie said.

But, the SCA chairman added, to implement this plan would require assistance from the international community. One challenge is that specific equipment is required, including a crane high enough to remove containers from the ship's bow, which Egypt does not have.

Speaking at a news conference Saturday, Rabie said: ""Plan C is the difficult one, the unloading operation. It's difficult because there are 18,000 containers, and there is no crane that can access the containers.""

He said the United States, China, Greece and the United Arab Emirates had offered help.

In his phone interview Sunday, Rabie added that Egypt's President Abdul Fattah El-Sisi was checking in on a daily basis and advising on matters, including the decision to obtain the unloading equipment required in case they had to pursue that course of action.

Two additional heavy tugboats are expected to arrive at the Ever Given ""presumably early evening"" on Sunday, a spokesman for Boskalis, a sister company of SMIT Salvage, told CNN.

The pair have a combined pulling capacity of around 400 tons, said spokesman Martijn Schuttevaer. Once the tugboats arrive, it could take a few hours to hook up to the Ever Given, he said.

Boskalis' chief executive said Friday that he hoped those two tugs' extra pulling power -- combined with dredging, a high tide of 40 to 50 centimeters, and the ""lever power"" of the ship's stern being relatively free -- could be enough to wrest the container ship free.

A crane that could be used to remove containers from the ship's bow, should that plan fail, has also not yet arrived, according to Boskalis.

Speaking Saturday, Rabie said the reasons behind the accident remained unclear. ""There are many factors or reasons, fast winds and the sandstorm could have been a reason but not the main reason -- it could have been a technical mistake or human error,"" he said. ""There will be further investigations.""

Meanwhile, billions of dollars' worth of vital cargo and sensitive products are backlogged on the hundreds of vessels whose way is blocked. Around a dozen of them are carrying livestock.

The EU director of NGO Animals International Gabriel Paun warned that thousands of animals being transported on the vessels -- mostly Romanian -- could be at risk of dying if the situation is not resolved in the next few days.",2021-03-28 00:00:00
Scientists probe whether West Africa's recent Ebola outbreak was from man who survived epidemic five years ago,"(CNN) Scientists and global health officials are investigating whether the current Ebola outbreak in Guinea may have been triggered by a person who was first infected with the virus during the Ebola epidemic in the region five years ago.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is carrying out further investigations into the individual who appears to have had the virus lay dormant in their body.

This would suggest infections may persist once people recover and have the potential to start a future outbreak.

International researchers, including a team at the University of Conakry in Guinea, sequenced the genome of nine samples taken from people infected during the current outbreak and compared them against sequences from previous outbreaks to help identify the cause.

The results suggest the latest outbreak ""is the result of the resurgence of a strain that previously circulated in the West African outbreak,"" the authors wrote in their analysis.

The team found that the strain of the Ebola virus circulating resembled that of the Makano variant, responsible for the large-scale 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa.

""The similarities are big enough for us to declare that this is the same family of the virus,"" says Dr. Salam Gueye, director of the Emergency preparedness and Response Cluster at the WHO Regional Office for Africa.

But Dr. Alpha Keita, Deputy Director of the Centre de Recherche et de Formation en Infectiologie de Guinée (CERFIG) at the University of Conakry, who led the research, said his team have refrained from making any hasty conclusions.

They decided to be extremely careful and continue sequencing on additional samples to obtain more complete sequences that will provide a safer answer, he added.

In a separate report about the work, Keita explained that the implications in terms of public health and the safety of people, such as the risks of stigmatization, physical and verbal violence among previous Ebola sirvivors, called for such an approach.

Gueye said further investigations are now underway to see what exactly happened.

Guinea's Ministry of Health declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the country's Nzérékoré region on February 14. As of 25 March, 18 cases have been reported, including 14 confirmed and four probable cases. Nine people have died and 366 contacts are being followed up.

The latest outbreak started just 200 km from the epicenter of the previous epidemic, according to the researchers.

A sexually transmitted virus?

The first case in the current outbreak , identified in the sub-county of Gouécké, was a nurse who died at the end of January 2021. All other cases are people who attended the funeral on February 1, 2021, according to Gueye.

The nurse was an in-law to the spouse of the survivor who is thought to have carried the virus for five years. The spouse subsequently died of Ebola virus disease, the nurse soon developed the disease and is believed to have transmitted it to other people during the funeral. ""That is how the outbreak may have started,"" said Gueye.

Teams at CERFIG then sequenced the nine samples from people testing positive for Ebola, with the Makana variant identified in these samples.

The virus may have been latent and subsequently sexually transmitted from one person to another or the virus was present in the body and not causing illness, but due to virus mutation or host immunity going down it caused a relapse, Gueye told CNN.

Semen has been found to contain traces of Ebola virus long after a person was declared free of the disease.

""We are continuing to do epidemiological and anthropological investigations in order to reinforce that hypothesis or exclude it but so far that is the strongest hypothesis we have,"" said Gueye.

Wim Van Damme, a researcher and infectious disease expert at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, who was not involved in the research, cautions that this method of transmission would be a very rare event. ""There are more than 10,000 Ebola survivors in West Africa, and this is the first case, after five years,"" he said.

He added that while many people think the infection was most probably a case of sexual transmission. ""That is not for sure because the virus can remain present in other places in the body (mainly in the central nervous system)."" But he explains that it's also unknown how the virus would spread from the nervous system to another human being.

""We need to do supplemental investigations and epidemiological research in order to determine what happened and to have a strong hypothesis on it. There are a lot of facts that have given us enough information for us to react,"" Gueye told CNN.

Health workers from the Guinean Ministry of Health prepare forms to register medical staff ahead of their anti-ebola vaccines at the N'zerekore Hospital.

The WHO is working with the West African affected governments and a task force has been formed. ""The task force will further go into epidemiology, bioinformatics and laboratory to see what we can learn from this experience and translate it into the program"" said Gueye.

The risk of future outbreaks

""The fact is that we need to follow up these survivors for prolonged periods of time with frequent semen analysis for the virus. We can also provide condoms for them,"" said Dr. Merawi Aragaw, Incident Manager for Ebola, Africa CDC.

""The community needs continuous education. We are trying to reach the community through health workers they can trust,"" said Aragaw, adding that the Africa CDC continuously give survivors psychological support and advise partners and people in the community.

The WHO says it will strengthen surveillance, disease detection and disease responses for countries affected by Ebola.

""It will change the way we are responding to Ebola and the way we are preventing Ebola. It is a disease that needs to be in the surveillance system and it needs a collaboration of the community, the health workers, and also it needs to be a priority for the health authorities,"" Gueye said.

Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a rare but severe, often fatal illness in humans. The virus typically spreads through direct contact with the blood, body fluids or tissues of infected people or animals.

The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was the largest to date, spreading to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

A total of of 28,646 suspected cases were reported along with 11,323 deaths.",2021-03-26 00:00:00
'Practically a genocide': Doctors say rape being used as tool of war in Ethiopia,"More evidence of sexual violence being used as a deliberate weapon of war is emerging from Ethiopia's northern Tigray region , where an armed conflict has been raging for months.

Women are being gang-raped, drugged and held hostage, according to medical records and testimonies from survivors shared with CNN. In one case a woman's vagina was stuffed with stones, nails and plastic, according to a video seen by CNN and testimony from one of the doctors who treated her.

CNN has spoken with nine doctors in Ethiopia and one in a Sudanese refugee camp who say they've seen an alarming increase in sexual assault and rape cases since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military operation against leaders in Tigray, sending in national troops and fighters from the country's Amhara region. Forces from neighboring Eritrea are participating in the military campaign on the side of Ethiopia's government, as CNN has previously reported

""He pushed me and said, 'You Tigrayans have no history, you have no culture. I can do what I want to you and no one cares.'""

According to the doctors, almost all the women they treat recount similar stories of being raped by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. The women said the troops were on a self-proclaimed mission of retribution and were operating with near-total impunity in the region.

A CNN team in Hamdayet, a sleepy Sudanese town on the Ethiopian border where thousands of refugees from Tigray have gathered in recent months, spoke with several women who described being raped as they fled fighting.

""He pushed me and said, 'You Tigrayans have no history, you have no culture. I can do what I want to you and no one cares,'"" one woman said of her attacker. She told CNN she is now pregnant.

Many say they were raped by Amhara forces who told them they were intent on ethnically cleansing Tigray, a doctor working at the sprawling refugee camp in Hamdayet told CNN.

""The women that have been raped say that the things that they say to them when they were raping them is that they need to change their identity -- to either Amharize them or at least leave their Tigrinya status ... and that they've come there to cleanse them ... to cleanse the blood line,"" Dr. Tedros Tefera said.

""Practically this has been a genocide,"" he added.

The flood of refugees has become a trickle since Ethiopian forces reinforced the border in recent days, worrying refugees who are still hoping to be reunited with family members.

The Ethiopian government didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on allegations that its forces are carrying out a coordinated campaign of sexual violence against women in Tigray.

Three days after CNN published this investigation, the Eritrean embassy of the UK and Ireland responded by denying allegations of wrongdoing by Eritrean soldiers and denying that Eritrean troops were in Ethiopia.

Thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed in the conflict. CNN has previously reported that soldiers from neighboring Eritrea have perpetrated extrajudicial killings, assaults and human rights abuses in the Tigray region. Separate investigations by CNN and Amnesty International in February revealed evidence of massacres carried out by Eritrean forces in Dengelat and Axum. Eritrea's government has denied involvement in the atrocities.

The new reports of sexual violence come as US President Joe Biden dispatches Senator Chris Coons to meet with Abiy and convey US ""concerns about the humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses in the Tigray region."" The State Department has previously called for an independent investigation into atrocities committed during the war.

Ethiopia's government has severely restricted access to journalists until recently, making it challenging to verify survivors' accounts. And an intermittent communications blackout during the fighting has effectively blocked the war from the world's eyes. But in recent weeks, as foreign journalists have been allowed in, horrifying stories of rape and sexual violence are beginning to surface.

On Thursday, CNN affiliate Channel 4 News published a harrowing report into sexual violence against women in Tigray. The report included interviews from a safe house -- the only one believed to be operating in Tigray for rape survivors -- where around 40 women too traumatized to return to their families are receiving shelter and support.

""... they've come there to cleanse them ... to cleanse the blood line."" Dr. Tedros Tefera

One of the survivors told Channel 4 News that she and five other women were gang-raped by 30 Eritrean soldiers who were joking and taking photos throughout the attack. She said she knew they were Eritrean troops because of their dialect and uniforms. She said she was able to return home only to be raped again. When she tried to escape, she recalled being captured, injected with a drug, tied to a rock, stripped, stabbed and raped by soldiers for 10 days.

Outside of the safe house, many more women and young girls are being treated in Ayder Referral Hospital, the main medical facility in the regional capital Mekelle. Most have been referred there by hospitals in rural areas that are not equipped to handle rape cases, Channel 4 News reported.

One doctor at the hospital told CNN that more than 200 women had been admitted for sexual violence in recent months, but many more cases have been reported in rural villages and centers for the internally displaced, with limited to no access to medical care.

The fighting in Tigray, which has included attacks on health care facilities, has severely restricted access to medical treatment, according to a report published Thursday by international medical humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) . Of the 106 medical facilities MSF visited in the region, barely one in 10 were still operating, and one in five had been or was occupied by armed soldiers. One facility was being used as an army base, MSF said.

Between a lack of access to medical services and stigma surrounding sexual violence, doctors CNN interviewed said they suspect the true number of rape cases is much higher than official reports.

On February 10, the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) admitted that the war and associated dismantling of the regional administration in Tigray had ""led to a rise in gender-based violence in the region.""

A month later, on March 4, the United Nation's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet , demanded an ""objective, independent assessment"" of the situation on the ground in Tigray.

According to the UN statement , more than 136 cases of rape were reported in eastern region hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat and Wukro between December and January.

One coordinator at a gender-based violence crisis center in Tigray told CNN they used to hear of cases every few days or once a week. Since the conflict broke out, up to 22 women and girls seek treatment for rape every day, she said.

Demand for emergency contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections have also surged in recent months. Many of the women who have been raped have contracted sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, doctors told CNN.

One doctor said many of the women she treated were also physically abused, with broken bones and bruised body parts. She said the youngest girl she treated was 8 years old, while the oldest was 60.

The doctor said that many women who come forward share stories of others who haven't -- mothers, sisters, friends and other acquaintances.

A spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office told CNN that they would carry out a joint investigation with EHRC into allegations of serious human rights violations in Tigray.

Tigray massacre: How an Ethiopian festival turned into a killing spree,"All of the witnesses to this massacre have been given pseudonyms at their request due to fears of retribution.

Abraham began burying the bodies in the morning and didn't stop until nightfall.

The corpses, some dressed in white church robes drenched in blood, were scattered in arid fields, scrubby farmlands and a dry riverbed. Others had been shot on their doorsteps with their hands bound with belts. Among the dead were priests, old men, women, entire families and a group of more than 20 Sunday school children, some as young as 14, according to eyewitnesses, parents and their teacher.

Abraham recognized some of the children immediately. They were from his town in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, Edaga Hamus, and had also fled fighting there two weeks earlier. As clashes raged, Abraham and his family, along with hundreds of other displaced people, escaped to Dengelat, a nearby village in a craggy valley ringed by steep, rust-colored cliffs. They sought shelter at Maryam Dengelat, a historic monastery complex famed for a centuries-old, rock-hewn church.

On November 30, they were joined by scores of religious pilgrims for the Orthodox festival of Tsion Maryam, an annual feast to mark the day Ethiopians believe the Ark of the Covenant was brought to the country from Jerusalem. The holy day was a welcome respite from weeks of violence, but it would not last.

A group of Eritrean soldiers opened fire on Maryam Dengelat church while hundreds of congregants were celebrating mass, eyewitnesses say. People tried to flee on foot, scrambling up cliff paths to neighboring villages. The troops followed, spraying the mountainside with bullets.

A CNN investigation drawing on interviews with 12 eyewitnesses, more than 20 relatives of the survivors and photographic evidence sheds light on what happened next.

The soldiers went door to door, dragging people from their homes. Mothers were forced to tie up their sons. A pregnant woman was shot, her husband killed. Some of the survivors hid under the bodies of the dead.

The mayhem continued for three days, with soldiers slaughtering local residents, displaced people and pilgrims. Finally, on December 2, the soldiers allowed informal burials to take place, but threatened to kill anyone they saw mourning. Abraham volunteered.

Under their watchful eyes, he held back tears as he sorted through the bodies of children and teenagers, collecting identity cards from pockets and making meticulous notes about their clothing or hairstyle. Some were completely unrecognizable, having been shot in the face, Abraham said.

Then he covered their bodies with earth and thorny tree branches, praying that they wouldn't be washed away, or carried off by prowling hyenas and circling vultures. Finally he placed their shoes on top of the burial mounds, so he could return with their parents to identify them.

One was Yohannes Yosef, who was just 15.

""Their hands were tied ... young children ... we saw them everywhere. There was an elderly man who had been killed on the road, an 80-something-year-old man. And the young kids they killed on the street in the open. I've never seen a massacre like this and I don't want to [again],"" Abraham said.

""We only survived by the grace of God.""

Abraham said he buried more than 50 people that day, but estimates more than 100 died in the assault.

Yohannes Yosef, 15, was killed in the attack.

They're among thousands of civilians believed to have been killed since November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for resolving a long-running conflict with neighboring Eritrea, launched a major military operation against the political party that governs the Tigray region. He accused the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which ruled Ethiopia for nearly three decades before Abiy took office in 2018, of attacking a government military base and trying to steal weapons. The TPLF denies the claim.

The conflict is the culmination of escalating tensions between the two sides, and the most dire of several recent ethno-nationalist clashes in Africa's second-most populous country.

After seizing control of Tigray's main cities in late November, Abiy declared victory and maintained that no civilians were harmed in the offensive. Abiy has also denied that soldiers from Eritrea crossed into Tigray to support Ethiopian forces.

But the fighting has raged on in rural and mountainous areas where the TPLF and its armed supporters are reportedly hiding out, resisting Abiy's drive to consolidate power. The violence has spilled over into local communities, catching civilians in the crossfire and triggering what the United Nations refugee agency has called the worst flight of refugees from the region in two decades.

The UN special adviser on genocide prevention said in early February that the organization had received multiple reports of ""extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, looting, mass executions and impeded humanitarian access.""

Many of those abuses have been blamed on Eritrean soldiers, whose presence on the ground suggests that Abiy's much-lauded peace deal with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki set the stage for the two sides to wage war against the TPLF -- their mutual enemy.

The US State Department, in a statement to CNN, called for Eritrean forces to be ""withdrawn from Tigray immediately,"" citing credible reports of their involvement in ""deeply troubling conduct."" In response to CNN's findings, the spokesperson said ""reports of a massacre at Maryam Dengelat are gravely concerning and demand an independent investigation.""

Ethiopia responded to CNN's request for comment with a statement that did not directly address the attack in Dengelat. The government said it would ""continue bringing all perpetrators to justice following thorough investigations into alleged crimes in the region,"" but gave no details about those investigations.

""They were taking them barefoot and killing them in front of their mothers"" Rahwa

More than three weeks after CNN published this investigation, the Eritrean embassy of the UK and Ireland responded on March 22 by denying allegations of wrongdoing by Eritrean soldiers and denying that Eritrean troops were in Ethiopia.

The TPLF said in a statement to CNN that its forces were nowhere near Dengelat at the time of the massacre. It rejected that the victims could have been mistaken for being TPLF and called for a UN investigation to hold all sides accountable for atrocities committed during the conflict.

Still, the situation inside the country remains opaque. Ethiopia's government has severely restricted access to journalists and prevented most aid from reaching areas beyond the government's control, making it challenging to verify accounts from survivors. And an intermittent communications blackout during the fighting has effectively blocked the war from the world's eyes.

Now that curtain is being pulled back, as witnesses fleeing parts of Tigray reach internet access and phone lines are restored. They detail a disastrous conflict that has given rise to ethnic violence, including attacks on churches and mosques.

For months, rumors spread of a grisly assault on an Orthodox church in Dengelat. A list of the dead began circulating on social media in early December, shared among the Tigrayan diaspora. Then photos of the deceased, including young children, started cropping up online.

Through a network of activists and relatives, CNN tracked down eyewitnesses to the attack. In countless phone calls -- many disconnected and dropped -- Abraham and others provided the most detailed account of the deadly massacre to date.

Eyewitnesses said that the festival started much as it had any other year. Footage of the celebrations from 2019 shows priests dressed in white ceremonial robes and crowns, carrying crosses aloft, leading hundreds of people in prayer at Maryam Dengelat church. The faithful sang, danced and ululated in unison.

As prayers concluded in the early hours of November 30, Abraham looked out from the hilltop where the church is perched to see troops arriving by foot, followed by more soldiers in trucks. At first, they were peaceful, he said. They were invited to eat, and rested under the shade of a tree grove.

But, as congregants were celebrating mass around midday, shelling and gunfire erupted, sending people fleeing up mountain paths and into nearby homes.

Desta, who helped with preparations for the festival, said he was at the church when troops arrived at the village entrance, blocking off the road and firing shots. He heard people screaming and fled, running up Ziqallay mountainside. From the rocky plateau he surveyed the chaos playing out below.

We could see people running here and there ... [the soldiers] were killing everyone who was coming from the church,"" Desta said.

Eight eyewitnesses said they could tell the troops were Eritrean, based on their uniforms and dialect. Some speculated that soldiers were meting out revenge by targeting young men, assuming they were members of the TPLF forces or allied local militias. But Abraham and others maintained there were no militia in Dengelat or the church.

Marta, who was visiting Dengelat for the holiday, says she left the church with her husband Biniam after morning prayers. As the newlyweds walked back to their relative's home, a stream of people began sprinting up the hill, shouting that soldiers were rounding people up in the village.

Biniam, left, and Marta on their wedding day.

She recalled the horrifying moment soldiers arrived at their house, shooting into the compound and calling out: ""Come out, come out you b*tches."" Marta said they went outside holding their identity cards aloft, saying ""we're civilians."" But the troops opened fire anyway, hitting Biniam, his sister and several others.

""I was holding Bini, he wasn't dead ... I thought he was going to survive, but he died [in my arms].

The couple had just been married in October. Marta found out after the massacre that she was pregnant.

After the soldiers left, Marta, who said she was shot in the hand, helped drag the seven bodies inside, so that the hyenas wouldn't eat them. ""We slept near the bodies ... and we couldn't bury them because they [the soldiers] were still there,"" she said.

(Clockwise from left) Isayas Asgedom, Isaaq Isayas Asgedom, Arsema Yemane, Biniam Yemane and Alemtsahay Asgedom were all killed at the house where Marta was staying.

Marta and other eyewitnesses described soldiers going house to house through Dengelat, dragging people outside, binding their hands or asking others to do so, and then shooting them.

Rahwa, who was part of the Sunday school group from Edaga Hamus and left Dengelat earlier than others, managing to escape being killed, said mothers were forced to tie up their sons.

""They were ordering their mothers to tie their sons' hands. They were taking them barefoot and killing them in front of their mothers,"" Rahwa said eyewitnesses told her.

Samuel, another eyewitness, said that he had eaten and drank with the soldiers before they came to his house, which is just behind the church, and killed his relatives. He said he survived by hiding underneath one of their bodies for hours.

""They started pushing the people out of their houses and they were killing all children, women and old men. After they killed them outside their houses, they were looting and taking all the property,"" Samuel said.

As the violence raged, hundreds of people remained in the church hall. In a lull in the gunfire, priests advised those who could to go home, ushering them outside. Several of the priests were killed as they left the church, Abraham said.

With nowhere to run to, Abraham sheltered inside Maryam Dengelat, lying on the floor as artillery pounded the tin roof. ""We lost hope and we decided to stay and die at the church. We didn't try to run,"" he said.

Two days later, the troops called parishioners down from the church to deal with the dead. Abraham said he and five other men spent the day burying bodies, including those from Marta's household and the Sunday school children. But the troops forbid them from burying bodies at the church, in line with Orthodox tradition, and forced them to make mass graves instead -- a practice that has been described elsewhere in Tigray.

""... most of them were eaten by vultures before they got buried, it was horrible"" Tedros

Abraham shared photos and videos of the grave sites, which CNN geolocated to Dengelat with the help of satellite image analysis from several experts. The analysis was unable to conclusively identify individual graves, which witnesses said were shallow, but one expert said there were signs that parts of the landscape had changed.

The initial bloodshed was followed by a period of two tense weeks, Abraham said. Soldiers stayed in the area in several encampments, stealing cars, burning crops and killing livestock before eventually moving on.

Tedros, who was born in Dengelat and traveled there after the soldiers had left, said that the village smelled of death and that vultures were circling over the mountains, a sign that there may be more bodies left uncounted there.

""Some of them were also killed in the far fields while they were trying to escape and most of them were eaten by vultures before they got buried, it was horrible. [The soldiers] tied them and killed them in front of their doors, and they shot them in the head just to save bullets,"" he said.

Tedros visited the burial grounds described by eyewitnesses and said he saw cracks in the church walls where artillery hit. In interviews with villagers and family members, he compiled a death toll of more than 70 people.

The families hope that the names of their loved ones, which Tedros, Abraham and others risked their lives to record, will eventually be read out at a traditional funeral ceremony at the Maryam Dengelat church -- rare closure in an ongoing conflict.

Three months after the massacre, the graves in Dengelat are a daily reminder of the bloodshed for the survivors who remain in the village. But it has not yet been safe enough to rebury the bodies of those who died, and that reality is weighing on them.

Covid-19 drove hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou. A generation of mixed-race children is their legacy,"(CNN) When the coronavirus pandemic ground China to a near-halt in early February last year, Youssouf Dieng jetted back to Dakar for, he thought, a brief sojourn.

In reality, it was a year before Dieng -- who had worked as a goods trader in the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou in southern China for two decades -- could return, on an air ticket three times the usual cost, and a complicated business visa. By then, the pandemic had driven hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou, sparked the most severe anti-Black racial clashes in China in decades , and remade business operations, with Chinese factories connecting with African customers directly over e-commerce platforms.

""Now it is very, very quiet,"" Dieng says of Little Africa, a nook of Guangzhou informally named after the swell of thriving African businessmen who once lived, ate and prayed there in huge numbers. ""Not many foreigners now, and all the small shops are closed. Small business around here? No more.""

At the turn of the 21st century, Guangzhou -- already a magnet for internal migrants -- became an accidental experiment in multiculturalism in China, as loose immigration rules and factories churning out cheap products attracted droves of African entrepreneurs.

Business boomed, and by 2012 as many as 100,000 Sub-Saharan Africans had flocked to the city, according to Prof. Adams Bodomo's book ""Africans in China."" While that figure was never verified, it pointed to the generally accepted opinion that, between 2005 and 2012, at least, this was the largest African expatriate community in Asia.

As interracial marriages in the community flourished , Bodomo theorized that, in time, an African-Chinese minority would arise, becoming China's 57th ethnic group and demanding full citizenship rights. Today, that looks unlikely. By April last year, just 4,550 Africans were living in Guangzhou, according to local authorities, including students and diplomats as well as businesspeople.

Ten months on, more than a dozen experts and Africans who spoke with CNN said that number has further dwindled, due to several repatriation flights to Nigeria and Kenya, and tougher coronavirus-era visa rules, with most foreigners barred from entry to China . Many who remain are rooted in China by Chinese wives and children.

""For the whole issue of African traders in Guangzhou, I suspect that era is over,"" says Gordon Mathews, professor and chair of the Department of Anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""I'm skeptical that (their physical presence in the city) will ever be at the scale that it has been.""

The business case

One reason for the decline of the African community over the past year is strictly business.

In 2019 alone, of the 2.95 million foreigners entering China through Guangzhou, 358,000 were from African countries, according to local officials. Many came on quick visits to buy from the region's factories, using African residents as middlemen to connect with Chinese wholesalers.

When Covid-19 prevented foreigners from visiting China, the factory owners of the Pearl River Delta -- often cited as the world's biggest urban area -- had to rethink their business model.

Many in the area, which includes the cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan and Dongguan, began advertising their services on e-commerce giants such as Alibaba. This allowed them to connect with African customers directly, rather than waiting for them to come to the city in person to place orders, as had been the way for decades.

Pat Chukwuonye Chike has been in Guangzhou for nearly two decades, living on a business visa he renews each year. When Covid-19 hit, he stayed to avoid being separated from his Chinese wife and three African-Chinese children. He shuttered his clothing store, previously frequented by droves of visiting foreigners, and set up an Alibaba-type service on Facebook , which is banned in China but can be accessed via a virtual private netwoprk (VPN).

His online shop, Africa China Trade Service, connects about 20 factories he knows to his contacts in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea and Ghana. The advantage, he says, is his clients know they're dealing with factories they can trust.

But it's a competitive landscape. There are now hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants in Africa who can easily order from Chinese factories themselves, and sell to locals where they are living -- cutting Africans out of the equation in their home nations.

Some say that's what the Chinese authorities would prefer.

""China wants to be the middleman and not have Africans (in its borders),"" says Mathews, author of ""The World in Guangzhou."" ""So it would make much more sense for the Chinese merchants to move to Africa, rather than having the Africans go to China.""

Racial tensions

For centuries, Guangzhou has intermittently been a nerve center for migrants, whether internal or foreign. When African traders arrived in the city in the early 2000s, they formed a particularly visible enclave -- partly because they tended to congregate in one or two relatively small areas, and partly because black skin had not before been widely seen in China in large numbers.

The Africans also brought with them value systems that did not easily fit in with China's political environment.

Many were deeply religious, founding underground Christian churches, which sometimes attracted Chinese congregations -- a deeply contentious practice in a country where proselytizing by foreigners is illegal. As Beijing clamped down on non-state sanctioned religion in recent years, their house churches were raided and shut down by local police.

The Denfeng area of Guangzhou, in which Little Africa is located, has seen an increased police presence in recent years.

Africans from Muslim nations also continued to practice Islam, a religion Guangzhou has a long connection with, being home to China's oldest mosque . Guangzhou attracted communities of Hui and Uyghurs, Muslim minorities in China, who began serving halal food to the African incomers, as did a range of Middle Eastern eateries. But in recent years, as hostility to Islamic populations increased across China in the wake of the crackdown on Islam in the country's western region of Xinjiang, Africans have reported that restaurants serving halal food began to remove Arabic writing from their menus and signage.

Africans also formed small democracies within their own communities, voting for a head of each nation within Guangzhou, to lobby on their behalf with the local authorities on matters such as visas. Permanent residency for foreigners is extremely rare in China, and most African parents live in a status of constantly renewing one-year visas.

Those who cannot secure these often simply overstayed, creating an underground population of illegal African migrants in the city. A leaked WikiLeaks cable from 2008 revealed the central government was concerned by this, and had quietly funded research into the African community's impact on crime, underground religion and missed tax revenue.

In 2011, the provincial authorities clamped down on overstayers, offering rewards to Chinese who turned them in, and making it illegal for employers, hoteliers or educational institutes to serve them.

An increased police presence was seen in Little Africa from 2015 onwards.

Then, in 2014, the government embarked on the "" beautification "" of Little Africa, the once-rural village consumed by the city. The campaign tore down signage in the area that celebrated foreign trade, swept up street stalls serving local cuisines, and introduced a heavy police presence.

As policing of the community increased, several Africans running logistics warehouses told CNN that police installed CCTV cameras inside their premises, as well as X-ray scanners and devices plugged into their WiFi routers, in an apparent bid to clamp down on illegal exports.

CNN reached out to officials in Guangdong, the province of which Guangzhou is the capital, for comments on these claims but did not receive a response.

Racism in China

While many Africans spoke of leaving Guangzhou in the years leading up to the pandemic, much of the community remained, often rooted by marriages, children, a lack of better opportunity in Africa or elsewhere, and ultimately a sense of home.

While there is no official data on how many Africans in Guangzhou married Chinese women, a walk through the strip malls of Little Africa in recent years made it clear: scores of shops are run by an African husband and his Chinese wife, with their children running down the corridors.

Yet that sense of belonging was rocked for many last April when Africans across the city were evicted from their homes and hotels, and forced to live on the streets. After a handful of Nigerians tested positive for Covid-19, Guangzhou authorities quarantined and tested Africans all across the city, sparking unproven fears that Africans were vectors of the virus.

Last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: ""The Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally, opposes any differentiated practices targeted at specific groups of people, and has zero tolerance for discriminatory words and actions.""

An African in Guangzhou is tested for coronvirus at his apartment.

Still, Vassor Dieng, a sofa seller in Senegal who imports from China, remembers that incident, which went viral on Twitter in Africa. She says she has no desire to go to Guangzhou once coronavirus restrictions lift. ""I'm hesitant now to go to China from what I have heard since Covid started, and how they treat people,"" she says.

Back in Guangzhou, Nigerian father-of-three Chike says the way he is treated by some Chinese residents in his home city makes him feel they suspect Africans ""are the virus."" It's something, he says, he tries not to think about. ""Not everyone is comfortable in another country,"" he adds.

Many Africans in Guangzhou, however, report the city's Public Security Bureau has been lenient with visas for those with Chinese partners and children during the pandemic. Normally, a foreigner would have to leave and reenter China to activate a visa, something several Africans told CNN they had not been made to do, as it would trigger the need for a long quarantine.

Despite the challenges, many Africans want to return to their old lives in China. Congolese trader Felly Mwamba left the country during the Lunar New Year holiday in 2020 and has been living in Winnipeg since. After two decades in Guangzhou, he'd earned enough money to apply for Canadian citizenship and buy a home there, but the Winnipeg winter has been bitterly cold and he says he has few friends.

Yet he cannot get back into China. His business visa expired while he was in Canada, and to get a new one requires an invitation letter from local officials -- hard for him to obtain from another continent. In the meantime, he is paying rent on his office and apartment in China.

He's considering closing his languishing logistics business there, if he can't return soon. ""If really it is consistent going on like this, then I prefer to get out and relax,"" he said. ""See if I can do something in Africa.""

The legacy

Whatever their future, the heyday of African trade, life and love in Guangzhou has produced a generation of African-Chinese children. While many are still adolescents, some have reached adulthood, and are navigating how their mixed identity will fit into China's increasingly nationalist landscape.

Chinese Congolese singer and realty TV star Zhong Fei Fei.

Zhong Fei Fei, 24, says her parents met at the turn of the century in Guangzhou, where her Congolese father was a graduate student and her Chinese mother was doing business. They fell in love, and moved to Brazzaville. But after her father died when she was a toddler, she grew up in China with her grandparents: they renamed her Zhong Fei Fei -- a name that roughly translates to China-Africa.

Since then, she says she has grappled with not being ""Chinese enough"" in China. She said a Shanghai school teacher once told her class she spoke Mandarin well for a ""foreigner."" ""I was so confused because how come I'm the foreigner?"" she remembers thinking.

But she also has dealt with not being considered black enough in Congo.

Last year, her identity came to the fore when producers of the Chinese version of K-pop reality TV show ""Produce Camp 2020"" invited her to star in the series.

When Zhong emerged from the show, she was a trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, but not for the right reasons -- many were attacking her for her race. ""I was looking at my phone and I had like 200,000 messages or something,"" she says of reconnecting to the world after exiting the show. The online attacks came at the same time authorities in Guangzhou were accused of mistreating Africans there.

Zhong Fei Fei grew up in Shanghai, the daughter of a Congolese father and Chinese mother.

Yet Zhong says she also received messages of support, and subsequently used the platform to launch a music career.

For families in Guangzhou, Afro-Chinese celebrities like Zhong could be helpful for their children. Pastor Ignatius, a Nigerian evangelical preacher who has three African-Chinese children under the age of 12, hopes that ""what is happening in Japan might happen here,"" referencing the Afro-Japanese community there, from which many celebrated figures have emerged, such as tennis player Naomi Osaka.

""What we see from the school, they are very accepting -- though there are times of student discrimination here,"" he says, of the public Chinese school his children attend in Guangzhou. They all have Chinese passports -- without one, they would not be eligible for free education or healthcare. Dual nationality is forbidden.

Chike, who also has three African-Chinese children under age 13, says while there is ""more discrimination"" for the family to contend with in recent years, ""as long as my kids know who I am, where I'm from,"" they are free to live in the society they feel will be most beneficial.

Mathews, the Hong Kong-based anthropologist, previously speculated during the height of African migration to Guangzhou that the African community could provide China with its own Barack Obama figure -- a non-Han leader. In an era of growing nationalism, he now believes this community of Afro-Chinese children will more likely dilute to the point where they won't have a collective voice.

""They will probably blend in the overall landscape of Guangzhou because it has so many people from all over the place,"" says Mathews. ""I don't think they'll be noticeable ... it will be a few hundred people.""",2021-03-17 00:00:00
These women are shaping the future of African space exploration,"(CNN) In the heart of Cape Town, a control room buzzes with activity. Technicians monitor a grid of screens, scanning data that will soon make its way to astronomers working to deepen our understanding of the universe.

Operated by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO), the data is coming from the MeerKAT array -- one of the most advanced radio telescopes in the world. Comprised of 64 connected satellite dishes in a remote part of the Northern Cape, the $330 million telescope has put South Africa on the astronomy map. It's also a key component of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), an international effort that will see thousands of dishes built in remote regions of South Africa and Australia.

South Africa's MeerKAT array is one of the most advanced radio telescopes in the world.

""This is probably the biggest science project on the whole continent,"" says Pontsho Maruping, SARAO deputy managing director. ""We've already started training astronomers in other African countries.""

""What excites me is the fact that it allows people on the African continent to really contribute to one of the most technologically advanced industries in the world,"" she adds.

While an African-born astronaut has yet to launch to space, programs across the continent are on the rise , especially in the fields of satellites and telescopes. Consulting group Space in Africa values space programs on the continent in excess of $7 billion , while countries including Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, Angola, Kenya, Ethiopia and Rwanda have established or expanded their space agencies in the last 20 years.

Several of those programs include women in leadership roles. In celebration of International Women's Day, meet three inspiring female pioneers shaping the future of space exploration across Africa and beyond.

Jessie Ndaba, space engineer

Jessie Ndaba is the co-founder of Astrofica, a satellite tech company in South Africa.

When South African space engineer Jessie Ndaba and company co-founder Khalid Manjoo named their satellite startup, the choice was easy: Astrofica -- a hybrid of ""astronomy"" and ""Africa"" -- seemed like the perfect fit.

The fully Black-owned satellite tech company, based in Cape Town, specializes in assembling, manufacturing and testing satellite systems -- a lucrative focus of the African space industry. According to Space in Africa, 41 satellites had been launched from the continent by August 2020, and that number is likely to triple by 2024. More than $4 billion has been invested in satellite development across Africa so far.

Space ""was and is a calling,"" Ndaba says, noting that her fascination began with a photo of a rocket engine in a textbook gifted by her grandmother, who raised her in Johannesburg.

Having experienced the industry's evolution over the last 15 years, she says the key to success in the sector is collaboration -- and helping people on Earth. ""We are all for partnering with other countries in Africa or outside Africa,"" Ndaba says, ""as long as we are working toward improving people's lives.""

But she says sometimes that message gets lost, pointing to the common criticism that space endeavors are expensive and that governments like South Africa's should be investing in improving the lives of its citizens.

""There's a number of benefits that we get from what we do, but we fail to communicate it to people,"" Ndaba says, adding that satellite imagery can be used to assess land quality for farming or housing construction.

""We're always looking at the challenges that people are facing, and we look for the solution.""

Adriana Marais, physicist and explorer

South African physicist Adriana Marais is the founder of Proudly Human.

Adriana Marais has set her sights on Mars -- and it's a mission she's been planning for as long as she can remember.

""If I had to choose a particular outcome for my life, spending my last days on Mars would be it,"" Marais says.

In 2015, the South African physicist came a step closer to realizing her dream when she was shortlisted as one of 100 astronaut candidates for the Mars One Project , a private venture to build a permanent settlement on the red planet.

But there's still much to learn about Mars before humans can survive on its surface -- or even successfully make the trip. After a nine-month journey just to get there, astronauts will encounter extreme conditions on arrival.

On Earth, Marais is preparing to simulate that harsh environment. In 2019, she founded research organization Proudly Human , which plans to run a series of settlement experiments in extreme environments as part of its Off-World project.

""We will have teams arriving, setting up infrastructure from scratch, and living and doing research in those extreme locations for duration of the experiment,"" says Marais.

In December 2019, she traveled to Antarctica to begin setting up a community where selected participants will spend nine months in complete isolation. The project is now on hold because of the pandemic but Marais says Antarctica will be an ideal testing ground.

""Temperatures in the winter in Antarctica range between -60 and -70 degrees Fahrenheit in the interior, and this is the average temperature on Mars in terms of testing infrastructure like water systems,"" she says.

According to Proudly Human, the research and technology developed to support life in environmental extremes can also help inform solutions on Earth, where billions of people worldwide lack access to clean water and air, reliable power sources, and a secure food supply

""I feel we have a duty living in this challenging era,"" says Marais, ""creating a future that we can be proud of, whatever planet we're on.""

Ruvimbo Samanga, space law adviser

Zimbabwean Ruvimbo Samanga is a space law adviser for her home country, which began its own space program in 2018.

Growing up in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, Ruvimbo Samanga first became interested in space as a young girl. But she never thought her love of ""all things extra-terrestrial and extra-planetary"" could become a viable career, and pursued law instead.

In 2018, she coached a team of law students that made history by becoming the first African entrants to win the prestigious, international Manfred Lachs Space Law Moot Court competition. That's when Samanga realized she could combine her two passions into one career -- and became a space law and policy adviser.

From there, ""the opportunities were boundless,"" she says. ""I think (space law and policy) just give me the most effective way of bringing about change in the industry. It's so exciting to see the field developing right before your eyes.""

Space law governs space-related activities , including the use of space technology, damage created by space objects, and the preservation of space and Earth environments -- and it has to constantly evolve to keep up with developments in technology.

Samanga represents Zimbabwe on the Space Generation Advisory Council , supporting the UN Programme on Space Applications -- which facilitates the sharing of space technology benefits with developing countries that don't yet have the resources to do it themselves.

""There are a lot of challenges in Zimbabwe and an urgent need for socioeconomic development all around,"" she says, pointing to the recent food security crisis brought on by severe droughts.

In 2019, Samanga started AgriSpace, which uses satellite technology to help farmers maximize crop yield.

Samanga built on her expertise to launch AgriSpace in 2019, a company which helps Zimbabwean farmers optimize crop yields. ""I realized there was a technological gap -- farmers are using archaic and traditional methods,"" she says. ""To bridge that gap, we use satellite imagery and data to give farmers the necessary information they need to know when to plant, how to plant, what to plant, and where to plant.""

For Samanga, all her work -- from law and policy to satellite tech -- stems back to her childhood fascination with space. She's now sharing that dream with students in Zimbabwe, inspiring the next generation of space explorers from the African continent.

""I dream for a world where girls do not have to question themselves and are not questioned,"" she says. ""My dream is to see more African youth, especially young girls, in the African space industry.""",2021-03-07 00:00:00
McLaren signs long-term deal with karting star Ugo Ugochukwu,"(CNN) McLaren Racing has signed a long-term agreement with 13-year-old Ugo Ugochukwu, a promising karting champion from the United States.

Ugochukwu has already claimed several titles in the US and Europe and was recently crowned FIA European karting champion.

His deal with McLaren, which was announced on Monday, provides the team with an option on Ugochukwu's services in the future while also supporting his development through motorsport's junior ranks.

""We've been watching Ugo's progress with interest, so when the opportunity to sign an agreement with him became available, we had no hesitation moving on it,"" said McLaren CEO Zak Brown.

Why airlifting rhinos upside down is critical to conservation,"(CNN) Swinging above the African savannah, an upside-down rhino suspended from a helicopter looks comically surreal. But for the black rhino, flying to new territory is no laughing matter -- it's about survival.

Most rhino translocations are carried out with trucks, but some remote locations can't be reached by road. So ten years ago, conservationists began using helicopters, on an occasional basis, to move rhinos to and from inaccessible terrain. The rhino is either placed on its side on a stretcher, or hung upside down by its legs.

Conservationists like the upside-down airlift because it's faster, easier and less expensive than the stretcher option, but until now it hasn't been clear how being flipped affects the rhinos.

Seeking to find out, the Namibian government asked a research team at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine to look into the practice. The results , published in January, were surprising. ""We were anticipating that the rhinos would fare worse hanging upside down,"" says Robin Radcliffe, a senior lecturer in wildlife and conservation medicine.

Instead, Radcliffe and his team found that although it looks like an uncomfortable experience, upside-down flying is the better option for rhino health.

The right way up is upside down

Namibia is home to a nearly a third of Africa's black rhinos -- one of two rhino species found on the continent.

Starting in 2015, the Cornell team suspended 12 black rhinos -- each weighing between 1,770 and 2,720 pounds -- upside down from a crane, and placed them in a side-lying position for comparison.

The researchers measured biomarkers for respiration and ventilation, and found that the rhinos had higher blood oxygen levels when upside down.

For the study, the research team from Cornell suspended 12 black rhinos from cranes.

Radcliffe says the upside-down position allows the spine to stretch which helps to open the airways. Additionally, the team found that when lying on their side, rhinos have a larger ""dead space"" -- the amount of air in each breath that does not contribute oxygen to the body.

The difference between the two postures was small, but because the strong anaesthetic used on the rhino causes hypoxemia -- low oxygen levels in the blood -- even a minor improvement makes a difference to the rhino's welfare.

Airlifting rhinos

Whether on their side or upside down, airlifting a rhino requires two helicopters: a small one to dart the rhino with a sedative, and a larger one to carry the animal. When the rhinos are lifted lying down, the stretcher adds additional weight, and the process takes longer -- according to Radcliffe, it can take a team of six up to 30 minutes to position and secure the rhino on the platform.

By contrast, attaching ropes to the animal's legs and feet can take just minutes.

Securing a rhino to a stretcher takes up to half an hour.

Radcliffe says it both reduces the expense -- together, two helicopters cost around $4,000 per hour -- and improves the wellbeing of the animal, by cutting the sedation time. The rhinos are sedated with opioid tranquilizers that are 1,000 times stronger than morphine and pose one of the biggest risks to the animal, whether it's being moved by road or air, says Radcliffe.

Why do conservationists move rhinos?

Black rhinos live in desert, shrubland and savannah across Africa, with the biggest populations in Namibia, South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe. In the 1960s, more than 100,000 black rhinos lived in the wild, but 30 years of aggressive poaching wiped out 98% of the animals. By the mid-1990s, just 2,354 black rhinos remained.

Since then, careful and targeted conservation efforts have more than doubled black rhino numbers to around 5,600.

But while the population is growing, the black rhino isn't out of the woods yet, says Jacques Flamand, leader of the World Wildlife Fund's Black Rhino Range Expansion project

Jacques Flamand, pictured, says the upside-down airlift is his preferred way to translocate rhinos. He has been using the method for a decade.

Rhinos are a ""density-dependent"" species, says Flamand, which means if there are too many in one area, their numbers will decline unless some are translocated elsewhere. Moving rhinos also helps to ensure a diverse gene pool, he says. ""We wouldn't want a black rhino bull to mate with his daughter or mother, which in nature would be unlikely due to the emigration of males, but in the fenced reserves, is a real risk.""

And rhinos are still pursued by poachers, who target them for their horn, which is highly prized as an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine and for jewelry and ornamental carvings. In some cases, rhinos are rescued from poaching hotspots and moved to areas where they can be monitored and protected.

In Namibia, government wildlife conservancy programs move rhinos to farms and reserves in remote communities. Local people are trained as game guards and rhino rangers, which helps boosts the local economy and keeps the animals safe, says Simson Uri-Khob, CEO of Save the Rhino Trust Namibia.

In 2020, rhino poaching in Namibia was down 40% from 2019 , which Uri-Khob credits to stronger community involvement: ""We have more boots on the ground compared to previous years.""

Will we see more flying rhinos?

Currently, the majority of rhinos are transported by road, and most airlifts involve journeys of around 30 miles, in trips lasting 20 to 30 minutes, says Radcliffe.

But airlifting rhinos is likely to become more common in the future, he says, as more rhinos are moved to rugged, inaccessible areas such as Namibia's northern Kunene region.

Airlift translocations enable researchers to relocate rhinos to hard-to-access areas, like Namibia's northern Kunene region.

""Namibia had the foresight to recognize that this type of transport will only increase in the future and that we should better understand the safety of the rhinos themselves,"" Radcliffe says.

He and his team hope to conduct research on longer airborne translocations, and investigate the impact of flight on brain activity and blood flow. Additionally, ""we know they do fine short-term, but we would like to monitor the rhinos after upside-down translocation, to see how they do long-term,"" he says.

Radcliffe hopes his research will lead to better protection for these endangered animals. ""What we can do as conservationists is to make sure that we provide the best security and the best management so that rhinos can recover,"" says Radcliffe. ""We have an obligation as global citizens to protect these animals.""",2021-03-17 00:00:00
"A 5,000-mile living wall could hold back the world's largest desert","(CNN) The world's largest desert is growing. In the last century, the Sahara Desert expanded by more than 10% , now covering an area of more than 3.3 million square miles (8.6 million square kilometers) and spanning 11 countries in the north of Africa.

The Sahel region, a semi-arid belt that acts as a buffer zone just south of the desert, is most affected. Water, already scarce, is becoming scarcer. Soil quality is deteriorating, and a lack of vegetation is leading to food insecurity. The UN estimates roughly 135 million people who depend on these degraded lands are at risk.

But an ambitious plan, launched by the African Union in 2007, could help to hold back the hot sands and protect the Sahel communities. Within the next decade, the Great Green Wall initiative hopes to restore 100 million hectares of land between Senegal in the west and Djibouti in the east, creating a 15-kilometer-wide (9 miles) and 8,000-kilometer-long (5,000 miles) mosaic of trees, vegetation, grasslands and plants.

Having previously struggled with insufficient and unpredictable funding, the project received a major boost in January: $14 billion in new funding from France, the World Bank and other donors -- contributing nearly half of the $33 billion the UN estimates is needed to achieve the 2030 goal.

If completed in full, the wall will be more than three times the length of the Great Barrier Reef, currently the largest living structure on Earth.

Fresh shoots

Nine years away from its deadline, there is still a long way to go. So far, 4 million hectares of land has been restored -- just 4% of the overall goal -- though this rises to almost 20 million hectares when counting areas outside of the official Great Green Wall zones.

Countries have tried a variety of conservation measures, such as reforestation, agroforestry, creating terraces, and dune fixing -- a technique that prevents the movement of sand long enough to let natural vegetation establish itself. They are also taking steps to protect water supplies, by drilling bore holes and building irrigation systems.

As well as restoring land, the initiative hopes to provide employment and food security to local communities.

Ethiopia is reported to have restored the most so far, producing 5.5 billion plants and seedlings, and planting more than 150,000 hectares of reforested lands and 700,000 hectares of terraces -- which together make up an area more than five times the size of London

""It took us more than a decade to set up the countries and all the strategies,"" says Elvis Paul Tangem, coordinator of the Great Green Wall initiative at the African Union Commission. ""But now we have laid the groundwork, we have seen what has worked and what has not worked, and we are on the highway to achieve our objectives.""

Among the biggest lessons learned is the importance of community collaboration, says Tangem. ""We went back to the frontline communities and looked exactly at their needs and the indigenous knowledge and practices that have been going on for centuries,"" he says.

Community value

Sarah Toumi, a French-Tunisian environmentalist involved in the initiative's recent fundraising push, agrees that such an ambitious project will only be possible if local residents are fully behind it.

""It's very easy to plant a tree, but it's not easy to grow one,"" she tells CNN. ""It's expensive in arid areas: you have to water it, you have to take care of it, you have to prevent animals from eating it.""

JUST WATCHED Africa's Great Green Wall plans to bring life to the desert Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Africa's Great Green Wall plans to bring life to the desert 04:17

Toumi speaks from her own experience after founding an organization called Acacias for All, which aims to restore land affected by desertification in Tunisia. The organization has planted more than 700,000 acacia trees in the region, she says.

Bringing communities into the initiative and demonstrating the value of restoration has been vital to the sustainability of the project. Toumi's organization helps to teach farmers how to harvest the leaves, fruits and gum of the plant so that they can make a living from it.

In addition to the Great Green Wall's target for land restoration, there is also the goal to create 10 million jobs in rural areas. So far, 335,000 have been created and growing fruit and forest products has earned $90 million, according to the UN.

""It's about creating sustainable livelihoods for people ... so that they can live peacefully in their ecosystems and preserve their traditions and preserve their landscapes,"" says Toumi.

Rather than a physical wall, the initiative aims to create a mosaic of trees, shrubs and grasses that will stretch across the entire continent.

Promoting peace

As the population grows rapidly in the region, land restoration combined with job creation is becoming all the more urgent. Across the African continent, more than half of the 375 million young people entering the job market in the next 15 years will be living in rural areas.

Climate change could increase political instability in the already fragile Sahel region.

If there is no job for someone in their community due to desertification and land degradation, they are likely to migrate -- which could trigger political instability across the world, says Monique Barbut, former executive secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and special envoy for biodiversity to the French President.

By involving 11 countries, the initiative could help to unite African leaders, she adds, ""(bringing) life back to that region of the world, which will help us stabilize that part of Africa on political grounds.""

Tangem agrees, noting ""the strong link between natural resource management and political stability in the region."" Once complete, the Great Green Wall could help provide a nature-based solution with a global impact.",2021-03-17 00:00:00
Why can't Nigeria protect its children from Boko Haram?,"(CNN) It was a kidnapping as brazen as it was unexpected.

While the numbers are murky, more than 300 schoolboys are still missing after an attack on a boys' school in northwest Nigeria nearly a week ago.

A large number of attackers riding motorbikes ambushed the children at the school.

""They said they were not here to rob us, that we shouldn't run. 'We are going to help you,'"" said 13-year-old Khalid Yargobe, who escaped over a wall with scores of his classmates as attackers breached the wall of his school.

While kidnapping for ransom by criminal elements in Katsina state have seen a disturbing increase, an abduction of this scale is unheard of.

It is a reminder of the brutal kidnapping of 276 girls from Chibok in 2014 by terror group Boko Haram. More than 100 of those girls never returned home.

On Tuesday, an audio message surfaced claiming responsibility for the kidnapping, purportedly from Abubakar Shekau, the leader of a faction of terror group Boko Haram.

Katsina State governor Aminu Bello Masari told CNN that officials have yet to see any concrete evidence that the boys were taken by the group.

But if the claim is true, it is a deeply disturbing shift of the influence of Boko Haram. For a decade, various factions of the group have killed tens of thousands of civilians, and displaced millions, in their stronghold hundreds of miles away in northeast Nigeria.

School bags of the kidnapped students are seen inside their classroom in Kankara, Nigeria on Wednesday, December 16, 2020.

Mission accomplished?

Almost exactly five years ago, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari claimed that the government had ""technically defeated"" Boko Haram.

While clearly politically motivated, there was some truth to his controversial declaration at that time.

In the months previously the Nigerian military, with international support and critical operational involvement from a coalition of regional states, pushed Boko Haram out of a huge swath of territory that the insurgents controlled in Borno State at the border regions.

In March of 2015, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS central in Syria and Iraq. Despite the clear ideological common ground between the two extremist groups, it was widely seen as a move made out of desperation as they were being hammered on the ground.

Pledging fealty to ISIS led to a leadership struggle and fracture, with Boko Haram splitting into at least two separate groups. One led by Shekau and the other calling itself Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP).

The loss of territory and infighting significantly reduced the threat of open combat, and the military freed countless kidnapped girls and women as they regained control.

Boko Haram then shifted even more to brutally unconventional tactics like suicide attacks, sometimes carried out by kidnapped girls.

But despite a relative period of peace, close observers of the Lake Chad basin believed there was always the threat of a resurgence.

Cycles of Violence

To understand why, you need to look at the origins of Boko Haram itself.

The group emerged in the early 2000s in Maiduguri, in Borno State. ""Boko Haram"" is really a nickname -- their official name translates to ""People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teaching and Jihad.""

But the nickname is apt -- it means ""education"" or ""western education"" is forbidden and the group's origins can be explained, in part, by their strict Salafist interpretation of Islam.

For several years Boko Haram grew relatively peacefully -- drawing supporters angered by the perceived threat of western education and morals coming from the federal government and seeping in from Nigeria's south (which is largely Christian). They also tapped into popular frustration at high levels of corruption and ineptitude from the state.

But it is impossible to attribute any single factor to Boko Haram's rise.

That mission led to its founder Some argue that the terror group's evolution into its current violent form can be traced back to a significant security operation against its members in 2009.That mission led to its founder Mohammed Yusuf's capture and killing.

Just last week, the international criminal court at the Hague accused both the terror group and the Nigerian security forces of potential crimes against humanity.

A staggering 10,000 people, many of them children, have died in detention during the conflict, according to a report by Amnesty International released in May.

In the Africa context, this cycle of violence between the state or conventional militaries and extremist insurgencies have played out in the Lake Chad region, the Sahel, Somalia and, in a recent troubling addition, Northern Mozambique.

Nigerian soldiers walk inside the school on December 15, where gunmen abducted students in Kankara, Nigeria.

Guns won't solve it

It's debatable whether Boko Haram ever enjoyed broad popular support in some regions. But their recent activity has eroded what support they did have and led to public anger.

Earlier this month, a group of militants on motorcycles killed more than 100 men and women near Maiduguri. They were part of a farming community.

According to Mohammed Awwal, a member of a local vigilante group, the attacks were reprisals because the community refused to give Boko Haram their food, a mafia-style arrangement that had previously kept them safe.

""They tied their hands behind their backs and cut off their heads,"" Awwal said, quoting an eyewitness.

However you explain their origins, Boko Haram has long been an insurgent group that preys on civilians, a parasite, really: taking food; women and girls as wives or slaves; kidnapping boys to ransom, swap for prisoners, or put into the field of battle.

But despite assurances from the government, the military and police aren't always viewed much better by many Nigerians. The recent #ENDSars protests are an offshoot of this anger.

Ultimately, there is broad consensus that guns alone won't extinguish the threat of Boko Haram for good.

To do that, there needs to be a wholesale change in strategy that broadens the focus to building community trust and opportunities. A focus on reconciliation, not violence. And for politicians brave enough to do it.",2020-12-17 00:00:00
Photo series shows why African hair braiding is about more than just aesthetics,"Written by Michelle Cohan, CNN

Ghanaian photojournalist and filmmaker Carlos Idun-Tawiah is not a fan of labels. But if he had to pick one for himself, he'd go with ""editorial photographer.""

The 23-year-old's fashion photos have graced the pages of Vogue, Essence and InStyle, showing off his vibrant yet composed style.

Between the beauty shoots and the fancy car adverts, Idun-Tawiah uses his camera to dispel misconceptions about African heritage.

""I just love to document stories that matter, that are important, that go beyond the colors or the framing,"" he told CNN.

Ghanaian Photographer captures the cultural roots of hair braiding

Most recently, he has focused his lens on the cultural roots of African hair braiding and threading. After reading a publication referring to hair braiding as a ""coronavirus hairstyle,"" Idun-Tawiah said he felt compelled to rectify the narrative.

Earlier this year, he collaborated with creative director Josef Adamu to conceptualize a sequel to Adamu's 2018 production, "" The Hair Appointment "" -- a photo series on hair braiding within the Black community in Brooklyn, New York.

""(Adamu) saw the need to really put out the essence of Black hair, of why we do (different types of) braids,"" Idun-Tawiah told CNN.

The series was shot in Accra, Ghana's capital, at a famous salon, Ebony and Ivory. Credit: Carlos Idun-Tawiah

After months of research and preparation, he and a team of five Ghanaians came together to create the second installment, titled "" Obaasima ,"" which in the Twi language translates to ""woman of substance.""

""I felt the need to continue that story in Africa to bring out the history, the real reason why people braid their hair,"" Idun-Tawiah said. ""It's not just for the beauty or aesthetic.""

The style can be traced back some 5,000 years in African culture, according to Ntombomzi Lekgoro, a hairstylist in South Africa. She told CNN that both women and men used to braid their hair -- and it was and still is a big source of pride.

The braids serve as a a protective style to help with hair growth. Credit: Carlos Idun-Tawiah

""There are different reasons why we braid our hair; when I was a kid my mom braided my hair to keep it neat for school, then as a teen I started braiding it for growth purposes and also for trends. ... Now that I'm a mom I braid my daughter's hair for growth purposes,"" she said.

The braiding itself doesn't yield growth; instead, it's the protective nature of the braids that allows for it -- even though the process of getting there involves a lot of tugging and pulling.

Because the salon appointments last several hours, they are social events in and of themselves, an element Idun-Tawiah wanted to capture in his series.

The photo essay has three parts: picking out a style, the process of the braiding and the ensuing fashion shoot to model off the new look. Credit: Carlos Idun-Tawiah

""Obaasima"" has three parts, he told CNN. ""(The photos) moved from the process of what you wanted to do with your hair, to the process of getting your hair done -- the experience of being in the salon with the hair braiders -- to the runway phase, capturing the fun of being a woman,"" he said.

""It was important for us to create this story in Ghana in an effort to remain authentic to style, inspiration, and also to pay homage to hair braiding origins,"" Idun-Tawiah added.

As for the future, he said he's always looking for the next story that needs its truth told.

""I definitely look forward to having more exhibitions, correcting various misconceptions and the world being educated through my work,"" he said. ""That to me is more than enough.""",

Ghanaian CEO Miishe Addy is pioneering her own path,"(CNN) Imagine for a moment that time travel is possible. What would you go back and tell your younger self? Perhaps it would be to take more risks, or to not let others steal your joy. For Miishe Addy, it would be three simple words: trust your intuition.

Addy is the co-founder and CEO of Jetstream Africa, a technology-enabled logistics company focusing on cross-border trade. Ghanaian by heritage and American by birth, she grew up in Texas and earned a philosophy degree from Harvard. But she always felt a pull to do something more innovative and impactful.

After moving to Ghana in 2017, an opportunity to innovate presented itself in an unexpected way. So, she followed her intuition and dove head-first into the male-dominated shipping logistics industry -- launching Jetstream in a country where women-run businesses are not only common, they are celebrated.

Globally, Ghana consistently ranks near the top for the number of women-owned businesses. A 2020 report found that 36.5% of all businesses in the country are owned by women -- the third-highest ranking out of the 58 world economies included the study and higher than countries such as the US, Spain and Australia.

Addy, pictured here in May 2020 negotiating cargo space on Ethiopian Airlines flights, is the co-founder and CEO of logistics company Jetstream Africa.

Now, three years in and with her company growing, CNN recently spoke to Addy to get a first-person perspective on being a female entrepreneur, what she has gained from her experience, and why with that journey comes a sense of responsibility to lend a helping hand to the women coming after her.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

CNN: What brought you to Ghana?

Miishe Addy: I moved to Ghana to teach business at a startup incubator in Accra and spend time with my extended family. When I arrived at Kotoka International Airport [in Accra] in 2017, there were signs everywhere that Ghana was developing fast. New housing compounds were springing up in what used to be forest areas, market women selling wares on the side of the road were using mobile phones, and I wasn't hearing the constant hum of generators as businesses were relying more on the national electricity company. Pre-Covid, Ghana was officially one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The pandemic slowed that growth, but demographics, governance, and economic fundamentals still point to a recovery this year.

CNN: What is your favorite thing about your career choice?

MA: My favorite thing about my career choice in tech entrepreneurship is the ability to make an impact. Technology is like nothing else in the sense that a relatively small team of people who build a technology platform that's relevant to the market can impact hundreds, thousands, even millions of people within a relatively short timeframe -- and (have) the ability to create things that are of value to other people and scale those things across countries, across geographical boundaries, across cultures. That's incredibly rewarding.

CNN: What have you learned about yourself as an entrepreneur and CEO?

MA: The most important thing I've learned about myself is that my intuition is often right. The things that I believe are going to happen in the world and that are going to materialize are accurate. And sometimes I doubt my intuition, or I'll ask a lot of people for their opinions because I want to get things right. But more often than not, when I'm the one closest to the problem, I have a big picture view of what the solution is. In many cases, I'm the best person to know what the answer is and where the market is going.

CNN: Speaking of problems, how has the pandemic affected your business?

MA: The second wave of Covid has hit the continent hard, but it has also accelerated trends toward digitization that were already happening in the shipping industry. Jetstream tripled our revenues and customer base last year, and this year we saw over 1,000 sign-ups for our mobile technology by logistics vendors who, two years ago, would not use their mobile phones for anything other than WhatsApp and phone calls.

CNN: Is it harder for a woman in Ghana to start out in the tech sector as opposed to other countries?

MA: I would generally say it's easier to be an entrepreneur as a woman in Ghana than in other countries. There are so many women entrepreneurs in this country who are doing amazing businesses in many different sectors. Technology specifically is a little harder in Ghana because there are so few women with engineering backgrounds or who have the capabilities to build an engineering or technology-based business.

CNN: What roles have your parents played in your life?

MA: Both of my parents are inspirations. My dad is an inventor, investor, and entrepreneur. He developed a groundbreaking sterilization device for Johnson & Johnson in the 1990s that is still used globally today. He's gone on to lead and invest in businesses and development projects in Asia and Africa. My mom is a whip-smart rabble-rouser who grew up in a military family, studied economics at Stanford, and now consults a bunch of manufacturing and logistics companies in Ghana. I get my ambition and entrepreneurial spirit from my dad, my stubbornness and grit from my mom.

Addy, pictured with family at a festival in Accra in August 2007, credits her parents as inspirations in her entrepreneurial career.

CNN: What are your secrets to success?

MA: My secrets to success are really not so secret. It's really about hard work and curiosity. I think over time, the biggest factor in my growth and in my company's growth has been our willingness to stay humble and to be wrong and to admit when we're wrong, and to fix our solution every time it's wandering astray from the problem. The entire business has grown on the basis of continually applying ourselves to a better understanding of the market and what we're doing. So, I would say humility and a growth-oriented mindset have been key.

CNN: What advice would you give to young women starting out in the tech innovation field?

MA: I think the key advice I would give to young women who are starting out, especially in technology entrepreneurship, is this notion of coming to solve problems that need you; coming when you're called, not when you're ready. And so, I think for many high-achieving women or women who are creative problem solvers, many times there's a lot of pressure to get things perfect or to get things right. And I would say that if you have an idea of a problem that you want to solve, and you have the intuition that technology could make that solution scale bigger or faster or to more people, do it. Don't wait till it's perfect -- just do it.",2021-03-26 00:00:00
Africa's Oscar-shortlisted films show an industry spreading across borders,"(CNN) It's an exciting time for filmmakers and movie fans around the world: Academy Awards season is here. And with several African films up for official nominations, people across the continent will be paying close attention when those nominations are announced on Monday.

The South African documentary film ""My Octopus Teacher"" is on the shortlist for an Academy Award this year.

As films from the continent continue to gain international recognition, Philippe Lacôte, Ivorian director of the 2020 film ""Night of the Kings"" (also on the shortlist for an International Feature Oscar nomination) says it is important for Africans to create movies that include their vision of the world.

His film explores themes across the physical world and the mythical one. Last year, he told CNN in an interview that it was key to show the world these themes because they are a part of Ivory Coast's culture.

""Today, Ivory Coast is on the map of international cinema,"" he said. ""It's important for me -- even if it's one film. We don't want to be outside this map.""

Meanwhile, Nigeria's film industry, Nollywood, will have to wait at least another year for its first chance at Oscar glory. The country, which has the largest film industry in Africa -- and the second largest in the world -- was disqualified in 2019 for failing to meet language requirements.

An evolving industry

African films are gaining more international attention as technology continues to remove some traditional access barriers -- helping films flourish across borders and find new audiences.

Video streaming sites like Disney+, iROKOtv , Netflix, YouTube, and Showmax act as aggregators, helping Africans gather and share content online from across the continent and beyond.

iROKOtv has hundreds of thousands of subscribers who can easily access Nigerian and Ghanaian movies from any part of the world. And Netflix, in partnership with multiple African filmmakers and production companies, is showcasing African movies that are accessible to people in over 190 countries.

Jason Njoku, co-founder of iROKOtv, says streaming services like his remove obstacles for Africans that traditionally blocked access to films from other regions. ""If you're interested in Nigerian movies, you literally just have to go online and within a minute, you can have a complete, unlimited library for you to watch,"" he says, for ""anyone, anywhere in the world.""

""Streaming platforms democratized content and storytelling,"" says Moses Babatope, co-founder of entertainment company FilmOne. ""What they have done is to break down any barriers like travel and immigration. They allow us to appreciate human stories across races and borders.""

Challenges and opportunities

Even with streaming, Babatope says that cinemas still play an important role in getting movies across borders. His company has helped view and distribute several Nigerian titles, including the 2017 Nigerian romantic comedy ""The Wedding Party 2"", which was viewed in cinemas across the continent . It has become one of the highest-grossing Nollywood films in the last decade.

That outlet is important because while technology removes some barriers, it can add others; according to the World Bank, less than a third of Africa's total population has access to broadband. Meanwhile, only 272 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have mobile internet access -- out of a population numbering more than 1 billion.

This means a significant part of the population is cut off from reaching video streaming sites such as Netflix and iROKOtv.

But Mary Njoku, director of the Nigerian production house ROK Studios, says it won't always be this way.

""Most people in the upper-middle class can afford to stream, but it won't be like that forever. Technological promise will catch up and then the market will explode,"" she says. ""So, we creatives just need to keep on creating amazing, compelling content and just wait.""

The potential is massive, with the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa with mobile internet access projected to increase to 475 million by 2025 -- and as the industry continues to grow, international media conglomerates are looking to the continent for partnerships and original content.

In 2017, pay TV company StarTimes announced the listing of Nollywood movies as part of its offering for the Chinese market, signaling interest in Nigeria's movie market.

Meanwhile, Netflix has appointed award-winning Kenyan film producer Dorothy Ghettuba as its International Originals manager. The streaming giant has acquired several films and originals including ""Lionheart"" and ""Blood and Water.""

And just last year, Disney announced a "" first of its kind "" collaboration with Kugali Media company.

Mary Njoku -- whose production house was acquired by French media giant Canal+ in 2019 -- says these partnerships with international studios will create room for bigger and more ambitious stories to be told about the continent.

""The African creative industry is young, dynamic, and ambitious. They have collectively created so much with so little,"" she says. ""Imagine what the next decade looks like with major studio partnerships.""",2021-03-11 00:00:00
Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade on his company's journey from Nigeria to Silicon Valley,"(CNN) Over the last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has fueled a shift towards digital banking and mobile money. In Africa, this change in habits has international investors eyeing the lucrative opportunity to bring the unbanked online.

These digital platforms could help expand financial inclusion on the continent, where more than half of people over the age of 15 in sub-Saharan Africa lacked access to a bank or mobile money account as of 2017 according to the World Bank

Nigeria alone has more than 200 financial technology (fintech) companies, with the sector attracting global interest from companies such as Mastercard and Visa

According to a recent report from consulting firm McKinsey & Company , funding for Nigerian fintech companies between 2014 and 2019 topped $600 million. In 2019, outside investment in Nigerian fintech startups accounted for a quarter of all funding for tech startups across Africa.

One of the largest deals took place last October, when US-based digital payment powerhouse Stripe acquired Nigeria's Paystack, reportedly for over $200 million . Founded in Lagos in 2015, Paystack says it now has more than 60,000 clients, including corporations like Domino's Pizza and telecom giant MTN.

Shola Akinlade (left) is the co-founder and CEO of Paystack.

CNN's Eleni Giokos caught up with Shola Akinlade, Paystack's co-founder and CEO, to talk about the company's transformation from a Nigerian startup vying for attention in Silicon Valley to a payment giant with goals of expanding across Africa.

The following interview was edited and condensed for clarity.

Eleni Giokos: You process over 50% of all online payments in Nigeria. Did you think it was going to get this big when you started?

Shola Akinlade: We started Paystack from a personal pain. I've been seeing how things work elsewhere ... and I thought, 'Why can't we have good things here?' I think that was where it came from and, personally, just wanting things to be easier. I wasn't thinking, 'Oh, this is going to be big at all.' But I got into Y Combinator [which provides We started Paystack from a personal pain. I've been seeing how things work elsewhere ... and I thought, 'Why can't we have good things here?' I think that was where it came from and, personally, just wanting things to be easier. I wasn't thinking, 'Oh, this is going to be big at all.' But I got into Y Combinator [which provides seed funding for startups] in Silicon Valley.

And when I went to San Francisco, we saw people building amazing things. People were building shirts that never get dirty or a bra that detects breast cancer. I was initially intimidated when they said, 'What are you guys working on? ... How many people are in Africa?' I was like, 'One billion.' That was the moment I realized that this is going to be very big. If you figure out how to move money and commerce around, it's going to change lives, it's going to change the continent.

EG: You can formalize the informal sector because it plays such a huge part of the economy. Is that the dream?

SA: I think that's the interesting thing about Paystack. Our first set of customers are people that are building the future of the continent. I think Paystack builds a platform and we want people to build more on top of it. One of my customers is a company called BuyPower, making it easy for people to buy electricity digitally. We started with them four years ago and what we've seen is that the way people get included in the financial digital landscape is by real-world cases.

So, think about when your electricity goes off on a Friday night. You have two options: you can buy it digitally or you can wait until Monday and go walk somewhere. So there's a wide range of customers that Paystack is powering. If you look at the Google Play store probably the top 10 finance apps are all powered by Paystack.

Akinlade started Paystack in Lagos, and the company was acquired by US-based Stripe in 2020.

EG: Do you have to be a business to use this?

SA: Yes, we work with businesses. If you paid a business, you probably might have interacted with Paystack without even knowing. We empower the merchants, and the merchants will bring their customers. We invited our customers and said, 'What features should we build?' And everyone said ... 'We want you to let customers know that paying online is safe; paying online works.' One of the things we know at Paystack is if someone has a problem paying online with a merchant, that is someone that will never pay online again -- so we take that very seriously. We make sure that refunds get delivered instantly (and) disputes are resolved.

EG: We've seen the pandemic accelerating digitization. How has that influenced the way your customers are engaging with you in terms of your business' growth?

SA: Now we're doing probably more than five times more sign-ups than we were doing in March (of 2020). A lot of people are coming online, and I think this pandemic was a real reminder that African businesses are undertooled and underserved. It was easier for businesses elsewhere to react with access to the right tools and just move online.

EG: Do you want to scale this globally? I know that you're first looking at the continent. How big do you want to get?

SA: Paystack is one of those companies where the size of the opportunity is just so big. Today we're in just three countries. Africa has over 50 countries. So we need to scale rapidly across the continent. I think there's a lot that's going to happen in the continent and Paystack will build that infrastructure that allows us to scale across the continent.

EG: We keep saying that we can leapfrog legacy requirements and industrialization in a way, and just fast forward to AI and the digital world. Is that really possible? How do you see this playing out as someone who is a pioneer within the space of the digital world for the continent?

SA: I think the way ecosystems are built is everybody doing their part. I'll do my part, the person building the roads, she'll do her part. So I think it's not a zero-sum game. We will play our part on the technology side, but we need the roads, we need things with good governance. We need more things in different directions. We need people to help us tell our stories. It's hard to build and do all this yourself. So I think the ecosystem needs a lot of different parts working together and everyone doing their part.",2021-03-29 00:00:00
"Nigerian startup Flutterwave secures $170 million in capital injections from investors, now valued at over $1 billion","(CNN) Flutterwave, an African fintech startup has secured $170 million in capital injections from investors, the firm said in a statement Wednesday.

The young West Africans finding their voice through streetwear,"Written by Ify Obi, CNN

Streetwear has always been about more than just clothing. Over the last three decades it has become a global phenomenon, influenced by a DIY, no-holds-barred attitude expressed through fashion, music, art, dance and skateboarding.

And though streetwear has become popular all over the world, different places have their own iterations, including West Africa, where fashion is evolving as young people take streetwear's history of hip hop and skate culture influences and combine it with local styles to communicate their own realities.

In countries like Ghana and Nigeria, whose youth populations have soared -- 57% of Ghanians and over 60% of Nigerians are under 25 -- fashion has also become a way for young people to speak their minds and be heard by their communities and the wider culture. Here are some of the most exciting streetwear brands active in West Africa today.

Waffles N Cream

In Nigeria, Waffles N Cream are leading the way in streetwear fashion. ""Skate community and family,"" is how founder Jomi Marcus-Bello described the brand's ethos over email. Starting as an online lifestyle brand in 2009, Waffles N Cream has grown into an internationally recognized skate crew, who are also behind Lagos's first skate shop, established in 2017. ""Running a brand in Lagos has its hectic moments but we love it because it's home,"" Marcus-Bello said.

With no designated skate park, skateboarding in a city with nearly 21 million inhabitants and traffic-packed, ill-kept roads is not always easy. But this crew are committed to bringing an authentic Nigerian flair to the culture of skateboarding. This is reflected in apparel made from their own Ankara prints, used to create skate staples including bucket hats and baggy pants -- with 10% of sales going towards building that much-wanted skate park.

Vivendii

Fellow Nigerian brand Vivendii, which doubles as a DJ collective, is well-known within Nigeria's Alté music scene -- led by a new breed of genre-bending artists including Lady Donli, Odunsi The Engine and Santi, whose sounds are a distinct fusion of pop and Afrobeat, R&B, soul, dancehall, and hip hop.

""The arts are all intertwined so there are parallels between the way musicians and designers express themselves here,"" said Ola Badiru, co-founder of Vivendii, over email. ""You know the feeling you get when you connect to certain sounds, we try to emulate that energy in our designs. For example, if pain is being conveyed through the music and we connect to that feeling, we'll incorporate it -- we'll convey it through the imagery and text on our clothing.""

First launched as a fashion blog in 2011 by Badiru, Jimmy Ayeni and Anthony Oye, Vivendii's journey was set on course thanks to an influential meeting. ""We loved clothes and always imagined creating our own pieces. Then we met (fashion designer) Roberto Cavalli and (former editor-in-chief of Vogue Italia) Franca Sozzani (when they were in) Lagos, and they urged us to create a brand based on our style,"" Badiru said. ""Our designs are centered around our culture; the way we were raised and the way we live today."" From there, the luxury streetwear brand was born.

Vivendii have collaborated on a project with Virgil Alboh's Off-White and Nike, for a limited-edition soccer jersey, and their graphic T-shirts and bags have been sported by model Imaan Hammam. Meanwhile, as Vivendii Sound, they've Djed for Boiler Room in London, The Voodoo Club in Barcelona, and Afro Nation in Portugal.

Street Souk and Native Magazine

Young entrepreneur Iretidayo Zaccheaus recognized that there were few dedicated spaces in Nigeria for streetwear brands to showcase and network. As a response to this she launched annual pop-up event, Street Souk, in Lagos. In just two years, the expo has featured over 40 upcoming and established brands, with the next edition due in December.

Meanwhile digital and print publication Native, which defines itself as ""the reliable pulse of the African millennial,"" ensures a space for youth culture in Nigerian media. Its co-founder Seni Saraki said via direct message that many young people struggle to feel heard or taken seriously.

""I think Nigeria, and this probably extends to West Africa as a whole, is built on the idea that the voices of young people should be lower than that of the elders,"" said Saraki. ""Even in matters that affect us directly, our opinion is sought last. And this occurs in every industry, whether the creative space, political sphere or legal community.""

Change might be in the air however, with the ""Not too Young to Run"" bill, which was passed in 2018, offering the chance for younger people to be active in politics. With 18 as the median age in Nigeria, youth involvement in politics and culture could have broad reaching significance.

Free The Youth

A similar feeling of being excluded from national discourse was expressed by Ghanaian Free the Youth brand co-founder Joey Lit. ""Before us, the mainstream fashion industry in Ghana was unwilling to acknowledge the youth in terms of job opportunities and consumer engagements,"" said Lit over email. ""Due to what is considered as appropriate dressing, we were seen as wayward for the way we dressed. A lot of doors were closed to us due to the fact that we weren't doing what was regarded as the norm""

Established in 2013 by Lit and Kelly Kurlz, and now a 10-strong group, the brand's collections are driven by stories true to the Ghanaian experience. One design, a screen printed ""1000 injured"" T-shirt, pays homage to the victims of a stadium disaster in 2001 during a game between the Accra Hearts of Oak and the Kotoko soccer teams.

Since then Free The Youth has made Vogue's VogueWorld 100 list of boundary pushers, and have done collaborations with Nike, Daily Paper and Foot Locker Europe.

The collective also run the Ghetto University of Tema, a budding NGO in their hometown, Tema, which provides young people with training to develop careers in music production, graphic design, photography and other arts-based paths. ""We created this movement in order to empower ourselves and other like-minded youth to embrace that freedom without judgment or reproach,"" Lit said.",
My body went viral twice. This is how it felt,"Written by Wana Udobang Lagos

Wana Udobang is a Nigerian writer, performer and TV personality. All opinions expressed in this article belong to Udobang.

The first time my body went viral, it was a photograph I posted on my Instagram. I'm wearing a blue swimsuit and I'm standing with one hand on my hip striking a pose on the beach in Havana, Cuba. I certainly didn't expect the number of reposts and neither did I expect people commenting in my inbox with words like ""Brave,"" ""Inspiring,"" and ""Confident.""

As far as I was concerned, I was just wearing beach-appropriate clothing while on holiday. Why is it that me documenting these seemingly normal activities conjure such loaded words?

But, in fact, my body has always been one of the major narratives in my life. For example, many of the nicknames I was given as a child were related to my fatness, like ""fatty bum bum"" -- said in endearment. My body seems to precede everything else about me -- at least in other people's minds.

As a result, I have always been aware of its ranking on the beauty and desirability front. In fact, whenever my body is the subject of conversation, someone usually says something about my ""pretty face,"" leading me to believe that I might have had the chance to be beautiful, but because of my body, I did not make the cut.

And while self-love has been a necessary part of shaping my own self-perception into something positive, it is not the panacea it is often touted to be. It hasn't quite insulated me from the impact of other people's thoughts about my physical form.

Second time around

The second time my body went viral, it was the result of a collaboration between me, Swedish designer Mina Lundgren of Notion of Form, and Nigerian photographer Lakin Ogunbanwo . The project was an exploration of the body as a sculptural form, with photos showing how folds, tan lines and stretch marks can become markers of interest. The result was a series of still images and a short film narrated with poetry that I had written.

The poem reads: ""You came out of your mother's womb, a sculpture of brittle bones and wrinkled flesh glistening in stardust and magic. You are miracle child, a lineage of women defying the notion of form. You are art, a body gorging with stories of love and loss, off absence and abundance, you are wild, soft and free. This is why they call you beautiful.""

The reception was overwhelmingly positive, and again my inbox was inundated with messages applauding my bravery, and admiration for my choice to bare my skin, as well as invitations to speak about body politics on Instagram live chats and television shows. And while part of me will remain bewildered by the fact that images of me can illicit such strong responses, it would be disingenuous to pretend that I don't have some idea why.

Bodies like mine are often deemed undisciplined, lazy, unruly, shameful, lacking in self-control and steeped in low self-esteem, so even any compliments that allude to my level of confidence and assumed boldness are likely to be rooted in bias.

This is also why me posting a photo of myself wearing a bathing suit automatically throws my body -- and all of me --into a ""political"" position, it's seen as me making a statement. But it also denies me the privilege of simply being vain, self-indulgent or just showing off my beach body, as smaller women might do.

The right to be there

I know firsthand how society's perceptions of what we look like shapes how we see ourselves, and sometimes how we live our lives. Once while auditioning for a television gig some hurtful behind-the-scenes information was leaked to me. During a board meeting someone had objected to my suitability for the role, saying that Nigerians don't like to see fat people on TV. I went through each audition stage with this knowledge hanging over my head -- but I still showed up. I still believed I had the right to be there. I got the job in the end.

Over the years my strategy has been to be likeable, overly pleasing and easy going. In professional situations I have refused to complain, even when it would have been justifiable for me to do so, afraid that I could be easily replaced, or that the topic of how I look would resurface. I decided that even if I wasn't the kind of person that people wanted to look at, at least I would be a dream to work with.

Regardless of conversations about expanding the scope of what we mean by ""beauty,"" and the work of body positivity movements over the years, it is impossible to ignore that how we see others -- and ourselves -- has been shaped by the images that circle around us daily.

Becoming a conduit

Over the last decade, I have been very lucky to have been involved in making art, and specifically performance, which has given me the means to connect with my body in more than just the obvious ways. From performing on a stage or in front of a camera to collaborating with visual artists, I have been able to see my body as both physical and metaphysical material, form and content, object and subject; a conduit for sharing and channeling creativity -- and not just an end in itself.

But until people are willing to take responsibility for their own limited views about beauty and what shape a body should be (especially a woman's body), I have settled on coming to terms with the fact that I will continue to oscillate between my own ideas about beauty and my body, and other people's expectations.",
This startup wants to be the Spotify of Africa,"London (CNN Business) African music has exploded onto the world stage in recent years, but its streaming platforms lag behind.

That means African artists are missing out on streaming revenue and royalties. According to the International Confederation of Authors and Composers, its African members only collected €72 million ($88 million) in music licensing fees during 2018, less than 1% of its global total.

Mdundo, a Kenya-based platform, wants to help change this. Set up in 2013 by Martin Nielsen, a Danish expat, it provides access to the continent's favorite music to more than 6 million monthly active users. The service is available throughout Africa, though until recently it focused mainly on the East Africa region.

Having watched Spotify revolutionize the music industry elsewhere, Nielsen wanted to create an alternative for Africa, which at that point was neglected by the global streaming giants.

""The philosophy is exactly the same,"" he tells CNN Business. ""We believe that if you create a product that is interesting enough for the user, they will move away from the illegal stream, and you can start making much more money for the music industry and the rights owners than ever before.""

But he believes his business has a model better-suited to the continent. ""We don't think that the product that Apple and Spotify are offering is the right one for the mass market in Africa. That's why we're doing it in a different way,"" he says.

Free downloads

Rather than chasing monthly subscriptions, Mdundo, which means ""rhythm"" in Swahili, is focusing on its free model, where users download, rather than stream, music by 80,000 artists free of charge. A five to 10 second commercial is played before each track.

Visa V Coca-Cola KO Brands such asand Safaricom advertise with them, and the revenues generated from songs are split 50/50 between the artist and the platform.

This free model appeals to many African users, who are often used to illegal downloads, says Eddie Hatitye, director of Music in Africa, a South Africa-based organization that supports the music sector across the continent, commissioning research and connecting musicians.

Mdundo estimates that legal competitors account for just 7% of all downloads in Africa. Because data plans are relatively expensive in Africa, music platforms need to offer downloads if they are to compete with illegal sites, he adds.

Going public

In September, Mdundo listed on the Danish stock exchange, raising around $6.4 million despite never having turned a profit.

Like Spotify in its early years, Nielsen says that his number one priority is growth. ""If we only focused on Kenya right now, we would be profitable or break-even,"" he says. ""But we honestly believe that the value of having a footprint across Africa, which is 1.1 billion people, rather than Kenya, which is 46-or-so million people, is significantly better in the long run.""

Mdundo's team is predominantly based in Kenya.

Nielsen is confident Mdundo's growth will accelerate, thanks to increased mobile penetration; an estimated 475 million people in sub-Saharan Africa will be mobile internet users by 2025, almost double that in 2019.

Local players

Mdundo is not the only African music platform. Spinlet and uduX are popular services in Nigeria, as is MusikBi in Senegal and Simfy in South Africa. But the popularity of these local platforms is still dwarfed by international brands, says Hatitye.

""Apple Music has significant market dominance on the continent,"" he says. Neither Apple nor Spotify would disclose their number of subscribers in Africa but Chinese company Boomplay has more than 50 million users, 90% of them in Africa.

But Hatitye believes African services will grow in popularity. ""There's always an appetite for something that is local and carries the DNA of the continent,"" he says.

Despite deals with major record labels like Warner Music Group, Mdundo's catalog mainly consists of African artists, including music in local languages, which the global platforms don't always offer.

research company GeoPoll. It's another differentiator to an African audience, which listens to more local artists than international, according to a 2019 study byresearch company GeoPoll.

""Local platforms are tapping into the interest of the local market,"" says Hatitye. ""They tend to focus on local talent and Africa's emerging talent, and these artists tend to find better exposure on these platforms.""",2020-12-18 00:00:00
Opinion: Entrepreneurs in Africa have great ideas. This will help them compete on a global stage,"Eleni Giokos is a CNN correspondent based in the network's Johannesburg bureau. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

Last month, I decided to treat myself to a pair of Kenyan-made Enda running shoes. I'm no marathon runner, but lockdown has inspired me to up the ante in my exercise regimen, and who better to trust with my feet than Kenya, home of the kings and queens of distance running?

My Endas cost 13,000 Kenyan shillings, which is around $117 US — not exactly cheap, but it still undercuts a few big-name competitors.

However, there was a catch: Delivery service DHL said it could only dispatch the shoes to my home in South Africa if I paid 879 South African rand — around $58 — in import tariffs. That's about half the value of the shoes. The import duty priced out the African-made shoe and handed the advantage back to Enda's big global competitors.

As it happens, I went ahead with my order, but others may have been put off. In many ways, it summed up the experience of high costs and logistical challenges that has held back intra-Africa trade.

Back in 1990, Africa's intra-regional trade languished at around 5% of total African imports, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Once a small Bedouin fishing town, it's now one of the Red Sea's top diving resorts, attracting thrill-seekers, nature lovers, and more recently, domestic tourists waiting out Covid-19.

Located an hour's drive from Sharm El Sheikh, Dahab is bursting with activity, yet it also provides a stress-free seaside atmosphere where visitors can just sit back and enjoy the many shades of blue of its waters.

The year-round paradise is built around a colorful boardwalk full of affordable accommodations, tour operators, handicraft shops, multicultural restaurants and cafes, each with its own very distinct vibe.

Its vibrant, multicultural community is made up of local Bedouins, along with Egyptians from mainland Egypt and international expats who were won over by Dahab's beauty, and its accessibility to all of Sinai's attractions.

""You feel yourself here,"" explains Julia Limonova, a Russian expat who moved to Dahab three years ago. ""You can find your circle because there are so many different people like free divers, divers, kite surfers, windsurfers and yogis.

""And there are different nationalities like Russians, Ukrainians, Germans and Italians.""

Dahab is also one of the few places in the area with internet access, making it attractive to remote workers looking for a peaceful ""office"" by the sea.

After the first Covid-19 case was reported in Egypt back in March, the government shut down all cafes and airports, implemented curfews and encouraged residents to stay home.

But social distancing in busy cities like Cairo can be difficult at times, which is why some have chosen to move to Dahab during the pandemic.

At the time of writing, there are no confirmed Covid-19 cases in Dahab, but it's worth noting this could be attributed to it being a small town with little to no testing.

""No one is talking about the coronavirus here. In Cairo, you are constantly bombarded with news,"" explains Rahma Zein, who chose to quarantine in Dahab on the advice of friends.

""It really takes a psychological toll and I believe that when your psychology is down, your immunity is down.""

""Being here and not being engrossed in the conversation of coronavirus really helps you just be and brings a certain level of normality.

According to Zein, the plethora of adventures available in Dahab, from free diving, to hiking and sunbathing, make it the ideal place to quarantine during these uncertain times.

""On a normal day, I wake up, make breakfast, go for a free dive, hang out on the beach, take a hike, eat then sleep,"" she adds.

""In between sessions, I make phone calls and do my work.""

The Blue Hole

Situated on the edge of the Red Sea, the Blue Hole is one of the world's most notorious diving sites. Shutterstock

One of Dahab's most famous sites, the Blue Hole is considered the world's deadliest diving spot.

But its infamous reputation has only boosted the impressive sinkhole's appeal to brave divers looking for an underwater Everest.

Descending to a maximum depth of 328 feet and easily accessible from the shore, the Blue Hole, is shielded from the currents, so its waters are relatively calm.

The conditions here are perfect for free divers keen to learn, as well as advanced divers looking to push their limits in a race against depth and lung capacity.

While it's entirely possible to scuba dive safely in the Blue Hole, its notoriety is due to an infamous archway known as the Arch, which connects the site with the open sea.

Scuba divers who seek out the Arch, located 184 feet below the surface, may succumb to narcosis, become disoriented, and ultimately run out of air.

To quell the traffic here, a local group of divers have created an underwater museum filled with mammoth statues made of recycled materials, creating an artificial reef.

The most impressive statue is a life-sized elephant weighing 700 kilograms that's gained the attention of countless tourists searching for a surreal underwater adventure.

Attempting to dive all of Dahab's submerged sites in a week would be nearly impossible as there are so many stand out spots, ranging from reefs to the incredibly well-preserved S.S. Thistlegorm.

Hit by a German bomber ship during World War II, this British Merchant Navy ship provides a rare underwater glimpse into history.

There are also limitless options in shallower waters for snorkelers who may want to avoid crowded diving spots.

Travelers can hike or trek by camel to Ras Abu Galum National Protectorate, which covers 400 square kilometers of coastline, and offers a better glance of pristine coral and marine life.

The Three Pools dive site in nearby Akaba is also a safe bet for those keen to get lost in a kaleidoscope of colorful fish.

The Blue Lagoon and Wadi Qnai

The Blue Lagoon is ideal for kitesurfing. @amrelhadeka

With its flat turquoise waters and constant wind, the Blue Lagoon is a tranquil hideaway with just enough speed for windsurfers and big air for kitesurfers.

There are only a few bamboo huts here and often only a handful of people, so it almost feels like you're entering an exclusive beach.

But the lagoon has no interest in catering to tourists with resort hotels or providing luxurious amenities.

It offers no internet, no phone reception, and barely any electricity, making it an ideal spot to unplug from the modern world.

Travelers are drawn to its beautiful simplicity, and if hunger strikes, local Bedouins are on hand, ready to catch and cook some of the freshest and tastiest seafood imaginable.

Many choose to camp here overnight to catch the spectacular sunrise and sunset.

While visitors can rent a hut or bring a tent, neither is required, as a sleeping bag on a sandy beach is all that's needed to watch the universe reveal itself, one star at a time.

Although Dahab's metamorphosis into a global hotspot is often credited to its diving and surfing possibilities, rock climbing is also becoming huge here, with new climbs being added every year.

The most popular site is Wadi Qnai, which caters to all levels of climbers, providing single and multi-pitch routes.

The sandy valley's landscape, made up of multiple granite boulders, is uniquely suited for bouldering in the shade.

It's way too hot to climb here during the day in the summer months, but some opt to camp overnight in order to climb at sunrise, before heading back to town to cool off in the sea.

There are also a number of top attractions just outside of Dahab, such as the town of St. Catherine, home to the world's oldest Christian monastery, and nearby Mount Sinai, the site where Moses is given the Ten Commandments in the Book of Exodus.

Meanwhile rock formation Jebel Makharum, or ""Mountain with the Hole,"" which lies between Dahab and St. Catherine, is another top hiking spot in the Sinai area.

Dahab during Covid-19

Rock formation Jebel Makharum, is known as the ""Mountain with the Hole."" @amrelhadeka

Dahab's wonderful versatility and relative remoteness are among the reasons people like Zein and Limonova have opted to remain here during the coronavirus pandemic.

""Social distancing is easier here,"" explains Zein. ""You are up in the mountains and when you go out, you are on your own.""

But although the influx of Egyptians moving from the city to Dahab may help the local economy in the short term, it also increases the risk of bringing the virus with them.

According to the Egyptian Health Ministry, there have been close to 40,000 Covid-19 infections in the country, with capital Cairo and the nearby provinces of Giza and Qalioubiya reporting the highest numbers.

""People are coming here from Cairo because it's safe and they have free time,"" adds Limonova

""But some people in Dahab don't want them to come here because we don't have enough medical facilities if something happens.""

In hopes of preventing an outbreak in Dahab, the government banned travel from Cairo, while beaches, cafes and diving centers were closed, easing the pressure on its marine ecosystem.

However, the restrictions are expected to be lifted in the coming weeks.

If Dahab avoids an outbreak, it will be in a great position to rebound when tourism returns, especially considering the lack of traffic here.",
Fayoum Oasis: Egypt's best kept secret,"Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.

(CNN) — It's difficult to imagine a desert oasis with a magical lake, cascading waterfalls, and a valley of ancient whales failing to be listed among a destination's top attractions.

But in a place like Egypt, with its ancient pyramids and beautiful beaches, competition is understandably steep.

Located less than two hours south west of Cairo, Fayoum Oasis is undoubtedly one of the country's hidden treasures.

Made up of many lakes and canals, this large region is an ideal weekend or day trip spot for those keen to escape the bustle of the city.

""Cairo is chaotic and noisy. The closer you get to Fayoum, the quieter and cleaner it becomes,"" Cairo-based Italian cinematographer Federico Corno tells CNN Travel. ""And then suddenly you see patches of green everywhere.

""People often think about Egypt as just sand, pyramids, the heat or the Red Sea. They don't imagine green farms, art and pottery, relaxation and meditation.

""In Fayoum, life just kind of slows down and goes back to the natural rhythm it should be.""

Chasing waterfalls

Wadi El Rayan, a protected national park that stretches across nearly 700 square miles, is one of Fayoum's many highlights.

It's comprised of an upper and lower human-made lake, with what's considered to be Egypt's largest waterfalls in between.

These waterfalls can be hard to spot from the upper plateau, as they're slightly smaller than other renowned falls.

But viewing the multiple drop-offs from the lower plateau is the best way to witness their collective beauty and experience a unique shower in the middle of a desert.

This site is famously crowded on weekends (during times of unrestricted travel), so it's best to visit during weekdays.

However, the area is nearly deserted during Ramadan, although a few residents seem to rely on what they catch in the lower lake to break their fast.

The sprawling park also features a variety of distinctive scenic attractions that include moving dunes, natural sulfur springs, mountains, and its best-kept secret, Wadi Al Hitan.

Walking whales

Wati El Hitan, known as the Valley of Whales, is home to the unique Fossils and Climate Change Museum. Shutterstock

A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2005, Wadi Al Hitan, is an open-air museum that offers a puzzling depiction of the evolution of life.

The skeletons of hundreds of gigantic whales, sharks, and infinite fossils fill the desert valley, which is also known as The Valley of Whales, painting a vivid picture of the sheer scale of its wondrous inhabitants of 40 million or so years ago.

From a distance, these incredibly preserved bones resemble winding teeth jutting out of the desert.

This valley is also home to the informative Fossil and Climate Change Museum that mimics the natural surroundings and could easily pass as a dwelling in a ""Star Wars"" film.

The centerpiece of the one-room museum is the prehistoric Basilosaurus.

This phenomenal 60-foot long fossil, thought to be the largest intact fossil of the ancient whale, is one of several extinct Archaeoceti fossils that can be found in the area.

The Basilosaurus possessed two tiny hind limbs, believed to be useless for movement, that protruded from its flanks, offering evolutionary evidence of the whales' transition from land to marine life.

Magic Lake

The Magic Lake is named as such thanks to its mesmerizing waters, which change color depending on the time of day and amount of sun exposure it gets.

Reaching its shores is just as fun as swimming in its magical waters, as this requires dune bashing the desert in a 4x4.

Looking down at the lake from the top of the dunes is something of a surreal spectacle, with the calm water serving as a crystal-clear mirror reflecting the sky.

The dunes are also large and steep enough to sandboard down.

Many visitors opt to camp for the night here to catch the magnificent celestial performance that only the milky way can provide.

""The raw sand and the high dunes contrasting with the color of the sky creates some stunning photos. In the summer, the milky way is super clear and looks like someone placed a carpet of stars in the sky,"" describes Egyptian travel photographer Amr El Hadeka.

Water wheels of life

The area's water supply comes from a number of water wheels that redistribute water from canals in the Nile. Courtesy Eihab Boraie

Bestselling author Paulo Coelho famously wrote about the beauty of Fayoum's oasis in his classic novel ""The Alchemist,"" and yet Fayoum is not actually a true oasis.

While an oasis derives water from an underground spring, Fayoum gets its water from the Nile, courtesy of a series of canals known as Bahr Yussef that were built by the ancient Egyptians.

There are around 200 waterwheels scattered across the area that redistribute the water from Bahr Yussef, which is responsible for giving the region its fertility and identity.

These celebrated waterwheels were introduced in the third century B.C. by Ptolemaic engineers, who used the topography of the land to lift water into irrigation canals, using the natural force of the fast-moving streams.

Located in the heart of Fayoum's colorful downtown area, they've become an important landmark, particularly for those who are passionate about history.

Birds of Lake Qarun

Lake Qarun is popular with bird watchers thanks to the 88 species of birds, including flamingos, found here. @amrelhadeka

Eons ago, Lake Qarun was known as Lake Moeris and the freshwater lake covered the entire Fayoum region.

Connected to the Nile via Bahr Yussef, this protected wetland is a small fraction of what remains of Lake Moeris.

Considered the world's most ancient lake, it's not suitable for swimming, but Lake Qarun has become a legendary destination for passionate bird watchers.

From large colonies of flamingos to various duck species, it's a unique ecosystem, supporting over 88 species of birds, and acts as a lifeline for endangered species like the slender-horned gazelle.

The abundance of birds living in this area has also made Fayoum popular among Egyptians for a traditional delicacy -- stuffed pigeon.

But this beloved Egyptian dish is unlikely to grace the cover of any food magazines.

It offers a small amount of meat, which tastes like a darker, slightly gamier version of chicken.

However, none of that matters, because it's the succulent seasoned rice, which absorbs all the savory flavors from within that makes it so popular that people often can't help but eat more than one at a time.

Tunis Village

Overlooking Lake Qarun, this colorful village teeming with diverse flora and fauna provides one of the most exquisite views Fayoum has to offer.

Aside from its natural beauty, Tunis Village is considered a thriving cultural arts hub due to its artistic residents who've shaped the village's identity, using their skillful hands to create gorgeous pottery and handicrafts.

The village's popularity has grown among Egyptians and tourists in recent years due to the annual Tunis Village Pottery Festival.

""I love this festival because anyone who does anything artistic can go get a booth and showcase their work alongside the locals,"" Amr El Hadeka tells CNN Travel.

""There's a lot of stuff going on like workshops and performances that give the festival an amazing vibe.

""People come from everywhere and get a chance to learn about the culture and leave inspired.""

The family-friendly festival usually takes place during the first week of November, which is also a great time to catch the variety of birds migrating into the area for winter.

Whether searching for relaxation or adrenaline, art or history, there's something for everyone in Fayoum.

Visitors can see many of its top sights in one go by taking a 4x4 desert safari day trip, as many of the locations are positioned close together.

It's surely only a matter of time before Fayoum considered among Egypt's must see attractions.",
Traveling to Egypt during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,"Editor's Note — Coronavirus cases remain high across the globe. Health officials caution that travel increases your chances of getting and spreading the virus. Staying home is the best way to stem transmission. Below is information on what to know if you still plan to travel, last updated on April 2.

(CNN) — If you're planning to travel to Egypt, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The basics

Egypt allowed the resumption of international flights last July, although all passengers must show proof of a negative test taken prior to departure (other than to three specified coastal resorts), as well as valid health insurance.

What's on offer

Egypt is full of big hitters: the Pyramids at Giza, sensational museums and cafe culture in Cairo, not to mention some of the finest diving in the world in the Red Sea. Explore the desert through some of North Africa's best hiking trails or take it easy at five star resorts complete with private beaches that slide gently into azure water. Cairo's long-awaited Grand Egyptian Museum is scheduled for opening in 2021.

Who can go

All travelers can enter Egypt providing they can show proof of a negative Covid-19 test.

What are the restrictions?

From September 1, all arrivals into Egypt, including its citizens, must provide a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure. This extends to 96 hours for arrivals from Japan, China, Thailand, North America, South America, Canada, London, Paris, and Frankfurt. The certificate must be written in English and Arabic and be stamped by an accredited laboratory. All travelers must complete a personal monitoring card and show proof of health insurance on arrival.

Alternatively, those arriving in the coastal governorates of South Sinai, Red Sea and Marsa Matrouh who cannot show evidence of a negative test are able to take a test and then isolate while awaiting the results, at a cost of $30. Those found to be positive must isolate for 14 days in a dedicated area of their hotel.

Most countries need an e-visa to visit Egypt, available here

What's the Covid situation?

Egypt has seen a total of 202,843 Covid cases and 12,041 deaths as of April 2. Following a large spike in June and July, deaths and cases tailed off during August, September and October, but were followed by a second spike early in the new year. Case numbers are currently on an upward trend. Vaccinations have begun, but only minimal doses administered so far.

What can visitors expect?

Masks are mandatory and must be worn on all public transit and in taxis, as well as in enclosed public spaces. Failure to wear a mask indoors could result in fines. There are also strict limits on public gatherings. Hotels, restaurants and cafes have also slashed capacity and brought in new hygiene measures to limit the spread of the virus.

Doing business in China is difficult. A clash over human rights is making it harder,"(CNN Business) Companies that want to do business in China have long made compromises in the pursuit of success. Now an escalating diplomatic dispute over human rights is underscoring the stark choice facing Western executives: put profit or principles first.

The strains over Xinjiang — where US, EU and UK authorities have accused the Chinese government of repressing Uyghurs and other minority groups through forced labor, mass detention and sterilization — has ensnared a growing number of businesses and trade relationships in recent months.

Beijing has vehemently denied all the allegations, and says its camps in the region are ""vocational training centers"" designed to combat terrorism and religious extremism. But last week, a landmark investment deal between the European Union and China was cast into doubt after officials traded sanctions over Xinjiang.

Days later,and other Western retailers were threatened with a boycott in China because of the stand they had taken against the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in Xinjiang.was even dropped by major Chinese e-commerce stores.

""We are working together with our colleagues in China to do everything we can to manage the current challenges and find a way forward,"" H&M said in a statement Wednesday.

Many companies have traditionally been willing to play along, given how enticing the giant economy is as a market for everything from Beijing has made it clear that multinational corporations have to follow its rules if they wish to operate in the country, and gaining favor can require anything from abiding by restrictive regulations to saying a few good words about China.Many companies have traditionally been willing to play along, given how enticing the giant economy is as a market for everything from cars and clothes to movies and luxury goods

But the escalating political blowback may make some of those relationships untenable. Just as China has whipped its citizens into a nationalist frenzy over Xinjiang, customers, lawmakers and investors are stepping up the pressure on Western companies to scrutinize their supply chains for evidence of human rights abuses. That's making it hard for companies to avoid picking sides.

""These companies are just squeezed in the middle and there is no magic answer,"" said James McGregor, chairman of consulting firm APCO Worldwide's greater China division. ""I think China's feeling really threatened by all of these sanctions, and has decided just to hit back as strongly as they can to try to get these companies to influence their governments to kind of tone down and back off.""

A tough-but-prized market

Foreign companies cannot simply ignore the world's second largest economy. Its growing middle class is a rich consumer market for many firms.

""Accessing the internal market in China has always been the draw,"" said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia and the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Years ago, when companies first started coming to China — even if they weren't making money for a number of years — they stayed because eventually the people are going to have more money and going to be able to spend.""

But breaking into China also means winning over notoriously strict regulators who wield vast control over who gets to enter and what they get to do.

International firms are often forced to concede certain aspects of their business before they're allowed access to the market, including through joint ventures established with local partners. While some rules have been eased in recent years, they're still a source of tension for companies who complain that such arrangements force them to give up technology in exchange for entry.

Thrust into controversy

Those who win access to China, meanwhile, can sometimes find themselves thrust into controversy, to damaging effect. In 2017, several stores owned by South Korea's Lotte were shut down across China after the conglomerate became embroiled in the deployment of a controversial US missile defense system in its home country. China had bitterly opposed South Korea's decision to deploy the system, which it saw as a threat to its own security.

""Businesses already are forced to pick sides, and they try really hard not to have to do that publicly,"" said Isaac Stone Fish, founder and CEO of Strategy Risks, a research firm focused on corporate risk in China. He pointed to the NBA as the ""most notorious example of that spilling out into the public.""

""They're trying to balance between their most important market and their most important growth market, and sometimes they make ethical sacrifices,"" Fish added.

The deck is stacked

Foreign businesses are almost always at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with China.

""The Chinese have huge economic leverage,"" Glaser said. ""They always do this in ways that they are harming a particular sector or industry or particular company, but where China pays no cost.""

China's strategy here is to ""kill the chicken to scare the monkey,"" Glaser said, using a popular Chinese idiom. ""They know full well the other countries are watching what's going on.""

Companies also appear to be learning that they can't always act in a vacuum when it comes to China — their statements to Beijing and Chinese consumers now often gain traction with other audiences.

The NBA, for example, didn't just anger Chinese audiences when it attempted to explain the remarks from the Houston Rockets' Morey about Hong Kong. A lukewarm response from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver that supported Morey ""in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression"" didn't just infuriate Chinese audiences; US politicians criticized the organization for not taking a strong enough stand.

And investors worldwide are also starting to pile the pressure on companies they believe aren't doing enough to address alleged human rights abuses. Earlier this week, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility -— a shareholder advocacy group focused on environmental, social and governance issues — told Reuters that it was reaching out to dozens of companies for information about their supply chains and whether they could at all be linked to Xinjiang.

Chinese state media and social networking platforms called for boycotts of major Western brands after statements made by the companies in the past about Xinjiang cotton resurfaced online.

Pleasing no one

The Xinjiang issue has made it even more difficult to please everyone at home and in China.

Many global brands, including Nike and Adidas, faced enormous pressure last summer from activists to ensure that their supply chains are free of ties to Xinjiang.

McGregor said that China may be conscious of upsetting the world too much ahead of that time. After all, if tensions come to a boil then the country risks tarnishing its reputation on a massive stage. But that still leaves many companies in a tough spot.

""Most of them are just trying to keep their heads down and get through it right now,"" he said.

H&M's comments on Wednesday, released days after it was swept up in the Chinese boycott, may be indicative of that pressure.

Opinion: Why China's space program could overtake NASA,"Eric Berger, a reporter and editor based in Houston, is the author of ""LIFTOFF: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days that Launched SpaceX."" After a long career at the Houston Chronicle, he joined Ars Technica in 2015 as the site's senior space editor, covering SpaceX, NASA and everything beyond. He was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his coverage of Hurricane Ike in the Houston Chronicle in 2008. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) China has a good chance of becoming the dominant space power in the 21st century, and it's not just looking to copy NASA on the way to the top. Instead, the country is paying close attention to what innovative US companies like SpaceX are doing as well. To get ahead in space, communism is learning from capitalism.

In the summer of 2019, a small Chinese rocket launched from an inland spaceport in the southern part of the country. Close-up photos, posted afterward on Chinese social media accounts, showed small grid fins affixed to the upper part of this Long March 2C rocket for the first time. They were virtually identical in design to the grid fins SpaceX uses to steer its Falcon 9 rocket through the atmosphere for landings on its ocean-based drone ships.

A year after this test, China's main space contractor revealed plans to develop the ability to reuse its Long March 8 booster, which is powered by kerosene fuel , the same type of power that fuels SpaceX rockets. By 2025, Chinese officials said , this rocket would be capable of landing on a sea platform like SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster.

And it is not just the Chinese government contractors that are emulating SpaceX. A growing number of semi-private Chinese companies have also announced plans to develop reusable rockets. Chinese firms such as LinkSpace and Galactic Energy have released schematics that seem to mimic SpaceX technology.

None of this should be particularly surprising. Government-launched enterprises in both Russia and Europe also recently revealed plans to develop reusable rockets that are similar both in appearance and function to the Falcon 9 booster. But what makes the Chinese efforts to emulate SpaceX particularly notable is the country's expansive ambitions in space and its vast resources to back up these long-term goals.

Earlier this month, the Chinese government signed an agreement with Russia to work together to build a Moon base . China has also begun planning to launch crewed missions to Mars and deploy a massive space-based, commercial-scale solar power plant by 2050. They're playing the long game, and they're playing to win.

Based on China's recent accomplishments in space, it would be wise to take these grand ambitions seriously. In December, China became only the third nation to return Moon rocks to Earth . Later this spring, it will seek to join the United States as only the second country to land and operate a rover on the surface of Mars.

NASA could also abandon the International Space Station in a few years. Meanwhile, China is training European astronauts and teaching them Chinese so that they might visit its large, modular space station. Some of these European astronauts may subsequently join the China-Russia lunar exploration effort.

Increasingly, the US' main advantage over China lies in its burgeoning commercial space industry, led by SpaceX. If America wants to compete, it should unleash the full potential of SpaceX and other commercial space companies that seek to go further in space, faster and for less money. This kind of public-private partnership has already worked in low-Earth orbit, with NASA buying services from companies such as SpaceX, Northrop Grumman and Boeing to deliver cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station.

This is one reason why, about five years ago , China began backing dozens of companies to commercialize rockets and satellites. The 21st century space race, therefore, is not so much between China and NASA. Rather, it is between China and the US commercial space industry.

Nearly a decade ago, SpaceX attracted international acclaim when it began to successfully land its Falcon 9 rockets, accomplishing an engineering feat many previously deemed impossible or impractical. While historically rocket boosters have been discarded in the ocean after they expend their fuel on the way to orbit, SpaceX figured out how to land its boosters upright on platforms at sea and on land, allowing the company to recover and refurbish the rockets and save money.

Later, the company strapped three of these Falcon 9 cores together to build a larger and much more powerful rocket, called the Falcon Heavy . And it is now testing an even larger, reusable booster, its Starship vehicle , intended to ferry humans to and from Mars.

This massive rocket would be unlike anything NASA built, however; Chinese officials, taking a page from the SpaceX playbook, said they would like it to be reusable. And, they added, they aim to one day launch the Long March 9 to take its taikonauts to Mars.

While SpaceX became a transformational space company, the US and China have been locked in an increasingly intense battle for influence and economic resources on Earth. That conflict, which has already emerged in low-Earth orbit, will extend to the Moon and eventually Mars in the coming decades. In the contest for geopolitical influence and economic wealth, space will come to represent the ultimate high ground.

China is definitely going.

For now, the US and NASA have the advantage of a more robust space program and a stronger commercial space industry. But for the last decade, the US commercial space industry has succeeded despite Congress, not because of it. Unless Congress and NASA more closely embrace commercial space and follow a bold plan of exploration, China's constancy of purpose and mimicking of Western strengths will overcome this head start.",2021-04-01 00:00:00
China's crackdown in Xinjiang has separated Uyghur children from their parents. CNN found two of them,"Xinjiang, China (CNN) It was supposed to be a routine trip home to Xinjiang for Mamutjan Abdurehim's wife and two children.

That was five years ago. He says he hasn't seen them since.

Mamutjan's wife Muherrem took their daughter and son from Malaysia back to the region in western China to get a new passport in December 2015. They remain trapped there, he said, caught up in the sweeping government crackdown against Muslim minorities that has reportedly seen up to 2 million people arbitrarily detained in vast camps across Xinjiang.

China has denied the allegations of human rights abuses in the region, saying the camps are necessary to prevent religious extremism and terrorism.

Mamutjan said his family, who are ethnically Uyghur, are unable to leave China, while he would be at risk of being detained or imprisoned if he returned. He is now living in Adelaide, Australia.

This week, a CNN team tracked down Mamutjan's 10-year-old daughter Muhlise at her paternal grandparents' home in the city of Kashgar, in southern Xinjiang.

When asked if she has a message for her father, whom she hasn't spoken to since 2017, Muhlise began to cry. ""I miss him,"" she said.

When Mamutjan watched the video from his home in Adelaide, he struggled to fight back his tears.

""I can't believe how tall (my daughter) is now ... What kind of country does this to innocent people?"" he said.

In a new report released Thursday , Amnesty International estimated there may be thousands of Uyghur families like Mamutjan's worldwide, parents and children who have been separated for years as a result of the Chinese government's tightening grip on Xinjiang.

Under the leadership of the country's all-powerful President Xi Jinping, Muslim minorities in Xinjiang have allegedly been subject to a government-engineered program of mass incarceration , forced indoctrination and even sterilization.

According to the Amnesty International report, some parents who fled the region in the early days of the crackdown have been unable to reunite with their children. Others, like Mamutjan, found themselves on opposite sides of the ocean by accident, and now fear returning to Xinjiang.

Alkan Akad, a China researcher at Amnesty International, said the separation of parents and children isn't all accidental. In some cases, it can be a deliberate tactic by authorities.

""The Chinese government wants to gain a leverage over the Uyghur population residing abroad, so that they would be able to stop them from engaging in activism and speaking out for their families and their relatives in Xinjiang,"" said Akad, who authored the new report.

Speaking at a news briefing on March 15, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang were ""baseless and sensational.""

""Xinjiang-related issues are not human rights issues at all. They are in essence about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism,"" he said.

The Chinese government has not responded to CNN's detailed questions on any of the families mentioned in the article, or on the scale of the family separations between Uyghurs in Xinjiang and abroad.

'We did not deserve all of this""

The last time that Mamutjan said his family were all together -- him, his wife and their two children -- was in Malaysia in 2015.

Back then, Mamutjan said he was studying for his doctorate degree in Muslim World Studies, with a full scholarship, while his wife, Muherrem was learning English. He said his daughter Muhlise was in kindergarten and ""very active,"" always running around everywhere, playing in parks and on the university campus. His son was only six months old.

""We were quite happy. We had no major troubles in life,"" he said.

In December that year, Mamutjan said, his wife went back to Xinjiang with the two children. According to Mamutjan, she had lost her passport and the Chinese embassy in Malaysia had refused to issue her a new one unless she went back to her hometown of Kashgar.

Her passport was renewed in 2016, but Mamutjan said his wife wasn't able to leave immediately due to some financial issues. Then, around the beginning of 2017, her travel documents and those of the children were confiscated by authorities.

A few months later, he said his wife vanished. ""I was in constant contact with my wife before April 15, 2017. We would chat daily, video chat with the children. And in the middle of April 2017, she promptly disappeared from (Chinese messaging app) WeChat,"" he said.

""I called home the following day and my mom told me that she was gone for a short period of time, for a short study course ... And I realized that she was detained.""

Mamutjan said he hasn't spoken to his wife since. Initially he was worried his children might have been sent to state-run orphanages, but later received social media videos showing them still living separately with their grandparents from each side.

Worried for his safety, Mamutjan said he left Malaysia and moved to Australia. There was no word from his family for years -- Uyghurs in Xinjiang can be placed in detention for only minor perceived infractions, including for contacting relatives abroad, according to leaked records seen by CNN , and it is common for families still in Xinjiang to cut communications.

Then in May 2019, Mamutjan said, he saw a social media video of his son, then age 4, excitedly shouting, ""My mom has graduated!"" The Chinese government insists the internment camps are ""vocational training centers"" and detainees are ""students,"" and Mamutjan took his son's joyful cheering to mean his wife had been released.

Mamutjan said he called his parents, hoping the video was a sign the family's situation had improved, but when his mother answered, she told him there were Chinese Communist Party officials in the house and hung up.

With Mamutjan's permission, CNN journalists visited his parents' house in Kashgar unannounced to see if they could help locate his children -- and find out what happened to his wife.

His daughter Muhlise answered the door in a bright pink shirt and black pants. When showed a picture of Mamutjan, she said: ""This is my Dad."" She said she knew where her father was but seemed unwilling to talk about her mother's location.

After checking the answer with her grandparents, Muhlise said her mother was at her other grandmother's house but she ""can't see her very often."" The 10-year-old said she last saw her mother ""a month or two ago."" She said her brother was not with her but she saw him regularly.

CNN has asked the Chinese authorities about the mother's whereabouts, but has not received a reply. CNN also tried to visit the maternal grandparents' home in Kashgar, but the team couldn't find anyone there -- the door was bolted from the outside.

When Muhlise was asked if she wanted to be reunited with her father, she said, ""We can't go ... Our passports were confiscated.""

After keeping her composure throughout the arrival of the CNN team, Muhlise began to break down when asked if she missed her father. ""I don't have my mom here, and I don't have my dad here either ... I want to be reunited with them,"" she said. Hearing the question, her grandmother burst into tears.

Mamutjan said he believed the Chinese government was separating parents from their children as a way to intimidate and control Xinjiang's minority groups.

""It's basically a collective punishment for their ethnicity and religion and their unique cultural values,"" he said. ""We did not deserve all of this immense suffering.""

Desperate measures

Some parents have resorted to desperate measures to try and be reunited with their children.

In 2016, Ablikim Mamtinin and his wife Mihriban Kader said they were forced to flee Xinjiang after she became pregnant with their sixth child. Under China's family planning policies , most families were only allowed to have one child until 2015, although rural ethnic minorities, including the Uyghurs, were permitted up to three in the region. A new policy implemented in 2017 said all urban couples in Xinjiang could have two children, while rural couples could have three.

With each new child, Mihriban and Ablikim said they had been paying fines and bribes to avoid punishments from the authorities. But in 2016, they said they were given a warning from local officials that their patience was at an end.

Ablikim said if they had stayed in Xinjiang any longer, his wife would have been forced to have an abortion. ""They would have imprisoned me for having six children,"" he said.

Mihriban and Ablikim managed to get tourist visas to Italy, giving them a chance to escape and start a new life in Europe. But their travel agent said they weren't able to get visas for all five of their children -- only the youngest. Zumeryem, Yehya, Muhammad and Shehide would have to stay behind.

The four siblings -- Zumeryem, Yehya, Muhammad and Shehide -- hold up a sign saying, ""Mom, Dad, we miss you,"" from their state-run orphanage in Xinjiang in 2021.

It was a heartbreaking choice for Mihriban and Ablikim. In the end, after leaving the four children with their grandparents, they left, hoping to be reunited as soon as possible once they were settled in Italy. But as the crackdown intensified in Xinjiang, their relatives in China stopped responding to their calls and emails. The parents heard some of their relatives were detained, which they believed was a result of their decision to leave for Italy. Soon it became impossible to contact anyone -- and they were unable to reach or learn the whereabouts of their four older children for almost four years.

When they finally reconnected in early 2020, and the parents heard how desperate the situation had become inside Xinjiang, they decided it was time to urgently take their children out of China. Visa clearance documents for the four siblings had been approved by the Italian government in 2019, but their passports were about to expire, and the parents say the authorities had been threatening to send the children to a state-owned orphanage.

In June 2020, directed remotely by their parents in Italy and a cousin in Canada, the four siblings -- then aged between 11 and 16 -- traveled from their remote village in Xinjiang all the way to Shanghai, a journey of more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers), in an attempt to get their visas to rejoin their parents in Italy.

The four children took little money and no baggage to avoid suspicion from authorities along the way. But when they went to the Italian consulate in Shanghai to pick up their visas, the children said they were blocked by a Chinese security guard in the lobby of the building, where the consulate sits on the 19th floor.

Emails from consulate officials then directed the children to a different Italian visa office in Shanghai, which eventually rejected their visa application, saying they couldn't recognize the visa clearance documents, and minors needed to be accompanied by adults. They also said the four should apply in Beijing, which was under a Covid-19 lockdown at the time.

The Italian visa office and the Italian consulate in Shanghai have not responded to CNN's inquiries. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rome told CNN ""we won't comment"" on the case.

Eventually the cousin lost contact with the four siblings as two of them were making their way back to their hotel. Later, the parents say they were told by their children that they had been taken by officials and brought back to Xinjiang, where they were interrogated and then sent to a Covid-19 quarantine center for two weeks.

When they were released, the four children were put into a state-sponsored orphanage.

In the county seat of Payzawat, about an hour's drive from Kashgar, CNN attempted to locate the four siblings with their parents' permission, but local officials did not allow the team to visit the children. CNN was able to connect with Yehya, the second-oldest child, over a WeChat video call, as what he called a ""teacher"" off camera prompted the young man with what to say to journalists.

When asked if he wanted to be reunited with his parents, he said, ""I do.""

At one point, a voice on the other end of the phone told Yehya, ""Tell them that you see your sister every day."" When asked if he wanted to pass on any messages to his parents, the voice told him to say that he had ""nothing"" to say to his parents.

Since their failed escape attempt, when the children occasionally gain access to a phone in the orphanage, they can speak to their parents. Recently, the children sent a photograph of the four of them standing in front of barbed wire outside the facility. Another image they sent showed the siblings with a sign in Chinese, saying, ""Dad, Mom, we miss you.""

Despite the difficulties they face in retrieving their children, Mihriban and Ablikim said they aren't going to stop trying.

Now living in the small Italian town of Priverno, near Rome, the couple encourage their three youngest children to kiss the photos of their older siblings every day.

""I will never give up until I bring back my children safely and rejoin with my family,"" Mihriban said.

'I only want to bring my children back'

In a report released in March, more than 50 global experts in international law and Xinjiang named China's removal of children from Uyghur families as a violation of the UN Genocide Convention.

Under the convention, ""forcibly transferring children of (an ethnic) group to another group"" is considered as an act of genocide, if it is intended to destroy the protected group. The experts found that was in the case in Xinjiang.

The March report quoted a Chinese government document that showed, between 2017 and 2019, the number of children who had been separated from their families in Xinjiang and placed into state-run boarding schools had increased by 76.9%, from just under 500,000 to 880,500.

During a news conference in Beijing on March 7, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi denied there was any evidence of genocide occurring in Xinjiang, calling the allegations ""preposterous.""

JUST WATCHED Beijing denies Uyghur genocide claims. Hear report's author react Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Beijing denies Uyghur genocide claims. Hear report's author react 02:52

Uyghur historian Rian Thum, a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester and co-author on the March report, said the placement of children in state-run orphanages is part of a Chinese government strategy to try to assimilate the Uyghur population.

""This is a consistent widespread policy, they have special terminology for it,"" Thum said. ""We see it not just in one area or two, we can see it across the entirety of the Uyghur region.""

The Chinese government has denied attempting to erase Uyghur culture, saying it respects all of China's ethnic minorities and religions. At a news conference in February, a spokesman for the Xinjiang government said there were a variety of reasons why Uyghurs overseas might have lost touch with their relatives back home, including that they may be ""criminal suspects in police custody.""

""If you cannot get in touch with your relatives in Xinjiang, you should contact the nearest Chinese embassy or consulate. We will work with them to provide assistance,"" he said.

But CNN's interviews with both sets of children illustrated the tight security and immense pressure under which many Uyghurs in Xinjiang -- both old and young -- live every day.

In his video call with CNN, Mihriban and Ablikim's son Yehya often repeated verbatim answers from the ""teacher"" next to him, glanced around nervously and looked off the camera.

Even when interviewed in their own home, Uyghurs appeared to watch their words. When Mamutjan's daughter Muhlise was asked during CNN's unannounced visit whether her mother had been sent to a ""vocational training center,"" she whispered to her paternal grandparents who told her in Uyghur to ""say nothing like that."" ""Say she is at home,"" her grandfather said.

The interview was cut short when the family said local authorities came around looking for them.

Mamutjan said he was worried not just about his own son and daughter but a whole generation of Uyghur children who had grown up under the crackdown in Xinjiang.

""The Uyghur children in the orphanages ... are being brainwashed, (they) would be clueless about their culture, about their language, and their religious values,"" he said.

For the four Ablikim siblings, their father is making a last-ditch, direct appeal to China's leader Xi Jinping, who has recently called his government's Xinjiang policy ""completely correct,"" to allow the children to fly to Italy and reunite with their parents.

""President of China,"" Ablikim said. ""I only want you to bring my children back.""",2021-03-18 00:00:00
China Xinjiang: First independent report into Uyghur genocide allegations claims evidence of Beijing's 'intent to destroy' Muslim minorities,"Hong Kong (CNN) The Chinese government's alleged actions in Xinjiang have violated every single provision in the United Nations' Genocide Convention , according to an independent report by more than 50 global experts in international law, genocide and the China region.

The report, released Tuesday by the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy think tank in Washington DC, claimed the Chinese government ""bears state responsibility for an ongoing genocide against the Uyghur in breach of the (UN) Genocide Convention.""

It is the first time a non-governmental organization has undertaken an independent legal analysis of the accusations of genocide in Xinjiang, including what responsibility Beijing may bear for the alleged crimes. An advance copy of the report was seen exclusively by CNN.

Up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to have been placed in a sprawling network of detention centers across the region, according to the US State Department, where former detainees allege they were subjected to indoctrination, sexually abused and even forcibly sterilized. China denies allegations of human rights abuses, saying the centers are necessary to prevent religious extremism and terrorism.

A Chinese flag flies outside the east gate of the Old City in Kashgar, Xinjiang, on November 8, 2018.

Speaking at a press conference on March 7 , Foreign Minister Wang Yi said allegations of a genocide in Xinjiang ""couldn't be more preposterous.""

On January 19, the outgoing Trump administration declared the Chinese government was committing genocide in Xinjiang. A month later, the Dutch and Canadian parliaments passed similar motions despite opposition from their leaders.

Azeem Ibrahim, director of special initiatives at Newlines and co-author of the new report, said there was ""overwhelming"" evidence to support its allegation of genocide.

""This is a major global power, the leadership of which are the architects of a genocide,"" he said.

This photo taken on June 4, 2019 shows a facility believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, north of Akto in China's northwestern Xinjiang region.

Genocide Convention

The four-page UN Genocide Convention was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948 and has a clear definition of what constitutes ""genocide."" China is a signatory to the convention, along with 151 other countries.

Article II of the convention states genocide is an attempt to commit acts ""with an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.""

There are five ways in which genocide can take place, according to the convention: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Since the convention was introduced in 1948, most convictions for genocide have occurred in the International Criminal Tribunals held by the UN, such as those for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, or in national courts. In 2006, former dictator Saddam Hussein was found guilty of genocide in a court in Iraq.

However any establishment of an International Criminal Tribunal would require the approval of the UN Security Council, of which China is a permanent member with veto power, making any hearing on the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang unlikely.

While violating just one act in the Genocide Convention would constitute a finding of genocide, the Newlines report claims the Chinese government has fulfilled all criteria with its actions in Xinjiang.

""China's policies and practices targeting Uyghurs in the region must be viewed in their totality, which amounts to an intent to destroy the Uyghurs as a group, in whole or in part,"" the report claimed.

A separate report published on February 8 by Essex Court Chambers in London, which was commissioned by the World Uyghur Congress and the Uyghur Human Rights Project, reached a similar conclusion that there is a ""credible case"" against the Chinese government for genocide.

No specific penalties or punishments are laid out in the convention for states or governments determined to have committed genocide. But the Newlines report said that under the convention, the other 151 signatories have a responsibility to act.

""China's obligations ... to prevent, punish and not commit genocide are erga omnes, or owed to the international community as a whole,"" the report added.

'Clear and convincing'

Yonah Diamond, legal counsel at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, who worked on the report, said a common public misunderstanding about the definition of genocide was it required evidence of mass killing or a physical extermination of a people.

""The real question is, is there enough evidence to show that there is an intent to destroy the group as such -- and this is what this report lays bare,"" he said.

All five definitions of genocide laid out in the convention are examined in the report to determine whether the allegations against the Chinese government fulfill each specific criterion.

""Given the serious nature of the breaches in question ... this report applies a clear and convincing standard of proof,"" the report said.

The Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy was founded in 2019 as a nonpartisan think tank by the Fairfax University of America, with a goal to ""to enhance US foreign policy based on a deep understanding of the geopolitics of the different regions of the world and their value systems."" It was previously known as the Center for Global Policy.

Vehicles stand in a parking lot as a large screen shows an image of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kashgar, Xinjiang autonomous region, China, on Thursday, November 8, 2018.

Thousands of eyewitness testimonies from Uyghur exiles and official Chinese government documents were among the evidence considered by the authors, Diamond said.

According to the report, between 1 million and 2 million people have allegedly been detained in as many as 1,400 extrajudicial internment facilities across Xinjiang by the Chinese government since 2014, when it launched a campaign ostensibly targeting Islamic extremism.

Beijing has claimed the crackdown was necessary after a series of deadly attacks across Xinjiang and other parts of China, which China has categorized as terrorism.

The report details allegations of sexual assaults, psychological torture, attempted cultural brainwashing, and an unknown number of deaths within the camps.

""Uyghur detainees within the internment camps are ... deprived of their basic human needs, severely humiliated and subjected to inhumane treatment or punishment, including solitary confinement without food for prolonged periods,"" the report claimed.

""Suicides have become so pervasive that detainees must wear 'suicide safe' uniforms and are denied access to materials susceptible to causing self-harm.""

The report also attributed a dramatic drop in the Uyghur birth rate across the region -- down about 33% between 2017 and 2018 -- to the alleged implementation of an official Chinese government program of sterilizations, abortions and birth control, which in some cases was forced upon the women without their consent.

The Chinese government has confirmed the drop in the birth rate to CNN but claimed that between 2010 and 2018 the Uyghur population of Xinjiang increased overall.

During the crackdown, textbooks for Uyghur culture, history and literature were allegedly removed from classes for Xinjiang schoolchildren, the report said. In the camps, detainees were forcibly taught Mandarin and described being tortured if they refused, or were unable, to speak it.

Using public documents and speeches given by Communist Party officials, the report claimed responsibility for the alleged genocide lay with the Chinese government.

Researchers cited official speeches and documents in which Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are referred to as ""weeds"" and ""tumors."" One government directive allegedly called on local authorities to ""break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections and break their origins.""

""In sum, the persons and entities perpetrating the enumerated acts of genocide are State organs and agents under Chinese law,"" the report said. ""The commission of these enumerated acts of genocide ... against the Uyghurs are therefore necessarily attributable to the State of China.""

Rian Thum, a report contributor and Uyghur historian at the University of Manchester, said in 20 years, people would look back on the crackdown in Xinjiang as ""one of the great acts of cultural destruction of the last century.""

""I think a lot of Uyghurs will take this report as a long overdue recognition of the suffering that they and their family and friends and community have gone through,"" Thum said.

'The lie of the century'

The Chinese government has repeatedly defended its actions in Xinjiang, saying citizens now enjoy a high standard of life.

""The genocide allegation is the lie of the century, concocted by extremely anti-China forces. It is a preposterous farce aiming to smear and vilify China,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a news conference on February 4.

The detention camps, which Beijing refers to as ""vocational training centers,"" are described by officials and state media as being part of both a poverty alleviation campaign and a mass deradicalization program to combat terrorism.

""(But) you can simultaneously have an anti-terrorism campaign that is genocidal,"" said report contributor John Packer, associate professor at the University of Ottawa and former director of the Office of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in The Hague.

World Uyghur Congress' UK director Rahima Mahmut, who was not involved in the report, said a lot of countries ""say (they) cannot do anything, but they can.""

""These countries, the countries that signed the Genocide Convention, they have an obligation to prevent and punish ... I feel every country can take action,"" she said.

While the report team avoided making recommendations to maintain impartiality, co-author Ibrahim said the implications of the its findings were ""very serious.""

""This (is) not an advocacy document, we're not advocating any course of action whatsoever. There were no campaigners involved in this report, it was purely done by legal experts, area experts and China ethnic experts,"" he said.

But Packer said such a ""serious breach of the international order"" in the world's second-largest economy raised questions about the global governance.

""If this is not sufficient to instigate some kind of action or even to take positions, then what actually is required?"" he said.",2021-03-09 00:00:00
China has built the world's largest navy. Now what's Beijing going to do with it?,"Spread out before him that April day was the largest flotilla Communist-ruled China had ever put to sea at one time, 48 ships, dozens of fighter jets, more than 10,000 military personnel.

For Xi, the country's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, the day was a way point to a grand ambition -- a force that would show China's greatness and power across the world's seven oceans.

""The task of building a powerful navy has never been as urgent as it is today,"" Xi said that day.

China was already in the midst of a shipbuilding spree like few the world has ever seen. In 2015, Xi undertook a sweeping project to turn the PLA into a world-class fighting force, the peer of the United States military. He had ordered investments in shipyards and technology that continue at pace today.

By at least one measurement, Xi's plan has worked. At some point between 2015 and today, China has assembled the world's largest naval force. And now it's working to make it formidable far from its shores.

In 2015, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) had 255 battle force ships in its fleet, according to the US Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI).

As of the end of 2020, it had 360, over 60 more than the US Navy, according to an ONI forecast.

Four years from now, the PLAN will have 400 battle force ships, the ONI predicts.

Go back to 2000, and the numbers are even more stark.

""China's navy battle force has more than tripled in size in only two decades,"" read a December report by the leaders of the US Navy, Marines and Coast Guard

""Already commanding the world's largest naval force, the People's Republic of China is building modern surface combatants, submarines, aircraft carriers, fighter jets, amphibious assault ships, ballistic nuclear missile submarines, large coast guard cutters, and polar icebreakers at alarming speed.""

Some of those will be the equal or better of anything the US or other naval powers can put in the water.

""The PLAN is not receiving junk from China's shipbuilding industry but rather increasingly sophisticated, capable vessels,"" Andrew Erickson, a professor at the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute, wrote in a February paper

A Type 052D Chinese guided missile destroyer participates in a naval parade to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of China's PLA Navy in 2019.

Those include ships like the Type 055 destroyer -- which some analysts say betters the US Ticonderoga-class cruisers for firepower -- and amphibious assault ships that could put thousands of Chinese troops near foreign shores.

Where the US stands

While China is expected to field 400 ships by 2025, the goal of the current US Navy shipbuilding plan, a goal with no fixed date, is for a fleet of 355 -- a substantial numerical disadvantage.

That's not to say the US Navy has seen its days as the world's premier fighting force come to an end.

When counting troops, the US Navy is bigger, with more than 330,000 active duty personnel to China's 250,000.

Analysts point out several other factors in Washington's favor.

The US Navy still fields more tonnage -- bigger and heavier armed ships like guided-missile destroyers and cruisers -- than China. Those ships give the US a significant edge in cruise missile launch capability.

The US has more than 9,000 vertical launch missile cells on its surface ships to China's 1,000 or so, according to Nick Childs, a defense analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Meanwhile, the US attack submarine fleet of 50 boats is entirely nuclear powered, giving it significant range and endurance advantages over a Chinese fleet that has just seven nuclear-powered subs in its fleet of 62.

Close to home, however, the numbers move in Beijing's favor.

""The big advantage the Chinese navy holds over the US Navy is in patrol and coastal combatants, or corvettes and below,"" Childs said. Those smaller ships are augmented by China's coast guard and maritime militia with enough ships combined to almost double the PLAN's total strength.

Those are troubling signs for Washington as it grapples with budget and pandemic problems that are much larger than China's. Analysts worry the trend lines, including China's announcement Friday that it will increase its annual defense budget by 6.8%, are going in Beijing's direction.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, meets with representatives of the aircraft carrier unit and the manufacturer at a naval port in Sanya, south China's Hainan province on Dec. 17, 2019.

Nobody can match China's shipbuilding

You can't have the world's largest navy if you can't build a lot of ships. China gives itself that ability by being the world's largest commercial shipbuilder.

In 2018, China held 40% of the world's shipbuilding market by gross tons, according to United Nations figures cited by the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, well ahead of second place South Korea at 25%.

Put in a historical perspective, China's shipbuilding numbers are staggering -- dwarfing even the US efforts of World War II. China built more ships in one year of peace time (2019) than the US did in four of war (1941-1945).

""During the emergency shipbuilding program of World War II, which supported massive, mechanized armies in two theaters of war thousands of miles from home, US shipbuilding production peaked at 18.5 million tons annually, and the United States finished the war with a merchant fleet that weighed in at 39 million tons,"" said Thomas Shugart a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former US Navy captain, in testimony before Congress last month.

""In 2019, during peacetime, China built more than 23 million tons of shipping, and China's merchant fleet ... totals more than 300 million tons,"" Shugart said.

The Chinese state-owned companies churning out commercial shipping are also the engines of its naval buildup.

""In conflict, excess PRC industrial capacity, including additional commercial shipyards, could quickly be turned toward military production and repair, further increasing China's ability to generate new military forces,"" Erickson, of the US Naval War College, wrote last year.

The infrastructure in place, the workforces involved and the technology employed in those commercial shipyards is applicable in turning out warships in quantity.

That's something China does very well. ""Between 2014 and 2018, China launched more submarines, warships, amphibious vessels, and auxiliaries than the number of ships currently serving in the individual navies of Germany, India, Spain, and the United Kingdom,"" according to the China Power Project.

""At the rate China is building naval vessels, and with the capabilities those newer warships have, I would say that they've already progressed from what was a coastal defense navy, to what is now probably their region's most powerful navy -- with some global reach -- and are on their way to building a world-class power projection navy if they continue growing as they have,"" Shugart told CNN.

The power of missiles

Beijing has been methodical in its naval buildup, with much of its numbers to date concentrated on craft such as corvettes, frigates and diesel-electric-powered submarines that would be useful in waters around China, said Sidharth Kaushal, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.

""The bulk of China's shipbuilding, such as its force of (approximately) 75 Type 056 corvettes , are smaller vessels of the corvette/frigate size,"" Kaushal said. Contrast that to the US Navy, whose closest ship to the frigate class, the littoral combat ship, now numbers only around 15 combat-dedicated vessels.

The corvette force is ideal for tighter, shallower ocean environments, like China's key areas of concern, the South China Sea ; around Taiwan; and the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea, controlled by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing.

The ships the PLAN puts to sea near Chinese shores are protected by a large ground-based missile force.

The missiles ""problematize US power projection and prevent overwhelming naval and air power from striking the Chinese mainland,"" said Kaushal. ""However, this also has the effect of facilitating power projection against local nations, as these nations are far more vulnerable when the maritime links that enable the US to support them are severed.""

For instance, if the US Navy was unable to operate in the South China Sea because of the Chinese missile threat, it would have a hard time protecting the Philippines, with which Washington has a mutual defense treaty.

US military leaders are also cognizant that in 2021 the PLA Navy is much more than ships.

""Take a look at what China's really investing in,"" US Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said this week in an interview with Breaking Defense . ""Yes, they are putting more ships in the water, but they're investing heavily in anti-ship missiles as well as satellite systems to be able to target ships.""

All that gives China a strong hand to play in any possible conflict close to home. And China is adamant its military is defensive.

""The development of China's national defense aims to meet its rightful security needs and contribute to the growth of the world's peaceful forces,"" said the country's 2019 defense white paper, titled ""China's National Defense in the New Era.""

""China will never threaten any other country or seek any sphere of influence.""

So why is the PLA Navy building aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships and large, powerful destroyers and cruisers suitable for operation far from China?

Near seas defense vs far seas protection

Protecting the Chinese mainland and its territorial claims around the region are what Beijing calls ""near seas defense.""

China's massive naval buildup coincides with it reinforcing its claims to almost all of the 3.3 million square-kilometer (1.3 million square-mile) South China Sea by building up tiny reefs and sandbars into man-made artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems.

""Islands and reefs in South China Sea have unique advantages in safeguarding national sovereignty and maintaining a military presence in the open sea,"" read a December 2020 article in Naval and Merchant Ships, a Beijing-based magazine published by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, which supplies the PLA Navy.

But they can't stand alone, the magazine noted. In the events of hostilities, outposts in the southern reaches of the waterway could require reinforcements from near China's southern coast, more than a day's sailing away, it said.

Piling resources in the near seas to achieve that level of control could be problematic for China, some argue. It may leave China vulnerable to a distant naval blockade that could deprive it of vital materials from abroad, severing what are termed sea lines of communication, or SLOC for short.

""China does not control the straits and transit lanes on which its economy depends and 'once a crisis or war at sea occurs, (China's) sea transport could be cut off,'"" Jennifer Rice and Eric Robb, senior intelligence analysts at the US Office of Naval Intelligence, wrote in a paper for the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute last month. ""The regional focus of near seas defense is also insufficient to address the increasingly global scope of China's economic interests.""

To bring Chinese military power to bear on its global interests, they said, China has begun implementing ""far seas protection.""

""Far seas protection reflects Beijing's direction for the PLAN to 'go global,' ... part of a larger Chinese government policy to encourage the expansion of China's economy and cultural outreach,"" Rice and Robb wrote.

Part of the play is perception. For decades now, nothing has quite projected military power as the image of a US Navy aircraft carrier in waters far from home. It's something China craves, analysts say.

""Some Chinese military analysts suggest it is imperative for the PLA to safeguard China's overseas interests and note that sending out the PLAN is essential to establishing China's image as a great power,"" Rice and Robb wrote.

Dozens of corvettes can't do that. So China has ramped up its production of ships that form an aircraft carrier task force, like guided-missile cruisers and nuclear-powered submarines, which have much longer endurance than the diesel-electrics that comprise most of the PLAN fleet.

The PLA Navy has two aircraft carriers in service, but their endurance without refueling is limited to less than week, according to the China Power project. That makes them more suitable for use in places like the South China Sea rather than in far oceans.

But more carriers are in planning and production. The newest planned Chinese carrier is expected to be equipped with a nuclear power reactor and electromagnetic catapults that will enable it to launch aircraft with more firepower and greater range than the existing carriers.

Rice and Robb point out that two Chinese defense white papers, from 2015 and 2019, say long-range naval forces are necessary to help with international peacekeeping, disaster relief and naval diplomacy -- in other words, flying China's flag overseas.

But they issue a warning. ""The peacetime nature of these activities can obscure far seas protection's wartime applications. The concept encourages offensive operations during wartime, despite the defensive strategy its name implies,"" they wrote.

Citing Chinese publications, they add, ""One source urges naval forces to 'control key strategic channels' far from China. Another source advocates employing strategic 'fist' forces formed around aircraft carriers. ... Another wartime mission is to strike important nodes and high-value targets in the enemy's strategic depth to 'ease pressure on the near-seas battlefield.'""

China's first aircraft carrier, Liaoning, arrives in Hong Kong waters on July 7, 2017.

What's possible now -- and later

Although the Chinese navy would be a formidable opponent for any foe, its practical abilities don't yet match its aspirations.

Firstly, the PLAN would require aircraft carrier battle groups with far stronger air wings than the Chinese fleet's current capabilities.

Aircraft carrier The Shandong, above, is the newest of China's two active aircraft carriers. Commissioned in 2019, it is an updated version of its predecessor, the Liaoning, which is a platform originally built for the Soviet navy. The Shandong carries an air wing of approximately four dozen aircraft split between fighters and helicopters. The Shandong is conventionally powered, meaning it can only operate about six days at sea before refueling. Source: China Power-CSIS

The PLAN's two active carriers are conventionally powered and based on old Soviet designs. That limits the range of the ships themselves, the range and number of aircraft they carry, and the payloads of munitions on those aircraft.

In short, they are not even near peers to the US Navy's fleet of 11 aircraft carriers. And just one of those US carriers makes an intimidating statement while steaming off a foreign shore.

""A US Navy aircraft carrier, its air wing, is more powerful than most countries' entire air forces,"" said Eric Wertheim, editor of the US Naval Institute's ""Combat Fleets of the World.""

The PLA Navy is not there yet. Note how limited China's long-range naval power projection has been to date.

China's aircraft carriers haven't ventured farther than the western Pacific, let alone to projected power globally. While PLAN ships have deployed to the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and into the North Atlantic to northern Russian ports, they've done so in small numbers and infrequently.

Just last week, state-run tabloid Global Times reported on a Chinese naval expedition group of at least five ships led by a guided-missile destroyer crossing the equator and sailing into the open sea. It did not give an exact location of the equator crossing but noted the group had likely been at sea for three weeks.

""Such missions enable the PLA to get familiar with the high seas as China eyes to build a blue-water navy,"" the report said.

Global Times said a year ago a similar expedition group ventured out into the Pacific, an event noted by Roderick Lee, director of research at the US Air Force's Air University China Aerospace Studies Institute.

Destroyer A Chinese navy Type 052D destroyer, front, takes part in an exercise with the Russian navy in the Baltic Sea in 2017. The ship, of which China had built 25 as of August 2020, is a prime example of how China is making modern warships with the ability to project naval power around the world, analysts say. Sources: Global Times, US Naval Institute

""The key takeaway from this training event is that the PLAN is developing the proficiencies to sustain limited offensive strikes against US forces -- perhaps as far out as Hawaii,"" Lee wrote for the Jamestown Foundation's China Brief

""The PLA Navy is making significant progress in joint operations, damage control, logistics, and intelligence -- to the extent that they may soon be able to operate on the doorstep of US Navy port facilities in wartime.""

But other analysts say the realization of the PLAN's blue-water efforts could be years, if not decades, away.

""By 2049 China aims to have a global military that's able to fight and win wars and project power globally,"" Meia Nouwens, senior fellow for Chinese defense policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said last week as the think tank released its annual world ""Military Balance"" report.

Along that timeline, analysts say they are looking for certain benchmarks to measure progress. They include establishing more overseas bases to support the PLAN -- it has only one, in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa -- and building heavy air transport to supply those bases.

""An interesting one will be when a Chinese carrier group makes a long-range deployment of significance, potentially into the Indian Ocean,"" Childs, the International Institute of Strategic Studies defense analyst, said.

Other notable deployments could include going into the Arctic and possibly the Atlantic, Childs added.

Soldiers stand on deck of the ambitious transport dock Yimen Shan of the PLA Navy as it participates in a parade in the sea near Qingdao, China, in 2019.

The Taiwan question

But in the near term, the center of attention is Taiwan, the democratic self-governing island that the powers in Beijing say is a historical and inalienable part of their sovereign territory.

Beijing's 2019 defense white paper said the island's authorities were ""intensifying hostility and confrontation, and borrowing the strength of foreign influence.""

""The 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces and their actions remain the gravest immediate threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the biggest barrier hindering the peaceful reunification of the country,"" the paper said.

And in a press conference in January, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman made clear where the military stands. ""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,"" Senior Col. Wu Qian said.

""The PLA will take all necessary measures to resolutely defeat any attempt by the 'Taiwan independence' separatists, and firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

In a speech in 2019, Xi said ""not a single inch of our land"" could be ceded from China.

""We should safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and achieve full unification of the motherland,"" he said.

In many ways concerning Taiwan, Xi has set up the PLA Navy fleet to do that.

As noted, the concentration of smaller surface ships like corvettes and coastal patrol craft are suited for combat near shores. And there's only about 130 kilometers (80 miles) of relatively shallow water between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, ideal for the corvettes.

Those six dozen or so corvettes, for example, can carry two anti-ship missiles each with ranges of up to 200 kilometers (125 miles). Imagine the tracking and missile defense headache that creates for the US Navy surface fleet in the Pacific, which can only muster about three dozen destroyers.

PLA capital shipbuilding can also been seen in the lens of Taiwan.

Late last year, the Type 075 landing helicopter dock (LHD), a 35,000- to 40,000-ton multipurpose ship about half the size of China's two in-service aircraft carriers, embarked on sea trials.

As one of the biggest amphibious assault ships in the world, the Type 075 has a full flight deck to handle helicopters, and a flooded well deck that can launch and recover hovercraft and amphibious vehicles, according to an analysis from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) . It also has the capacity to carry 900 ground troops, who the helicopters and hovercraft can put ashore.

The ship, the first of three in the water or in production, ""considerably elevates China's ability to transport, land, and support ground forces operating outside the Chinese mainland,"" analysts Matthew Funaiole and Joseph Bermudez Jr. wrote for the CSIS.

""The new class of ship ... represents a significant step forward for enhancing China's amphibious capabilities.""

But if China were to invade Taiwan, it would need far more than 900 ground troops to control and occupy the island.

And that brings us back to those numbers, including the coast guard, the maritime militia, even those merchant ships China produces like no one else can.

""We would be wise to assume that China will bring all of its tools of maritime power to bear in ensuring success in a cross-Strait invasion,"" Shugart, the CNAS analyst, told Congress, who drew an analogy to the escape of British forces from France in World War II to visualize his point.

""In something like the form of a reverse-Dunkirk, we should expect that instead of only dealing with dozens of gray-painted PLA Navy amphibious vessels and their escorts, we would likely see a Taiwan Strait flooded with many hundreds of fishing boats, merchant ships, and Coast Guard and Maritime Safety Administration vessels.""",2021-03-05 00:00:00
China's plans to 'improve' democracy in Hong Kong could spell the end of the city's opposition,"Hong Kong (CNN) As members of China's political elite prepared for an annual summit in Beijing this week, state-run news agency Xinhua noted ""there is no perfect democracy, only democracy that fits best.""

Hong Kong may be about to find out the democracy that fits best, at least in Beijing's opinion, is no democracy at all.

At the opening of the two sessions -- the twin meetings of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee (CPPCC) and the National People's Congress (NPC) -- Thursday, Zhang Yesui, the NPC spokesman, said recent unrest in Hong Kong ""showed that the electoral system needs to be improved"" in order to ensure ""patriots govern.""

Speaking Friday , Wang Chen, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said changes would affect both the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's already only semi-democratic parliament, and how the city chooses its chief executive.

The Election Committee, a Beijing-dominated body which currently chooses Hong Kong's leader, will be expanded, likely diluting the influence of any pro-democracy members, and will also be given the power to nominate all candidates for the legislature, as well as ""electing a relatively large share of Legislative Council members,"" Wang said.

"Tinker, Tailor, Sculptor: Faye Toogood is the designer behind a new Birkenstock bed","Written by Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN

While most childhood aspirations don't often play out in adult life, Faye Toogood realized her early dreams of becoming a sculptor and then some. Today her multidisciplinary practice, which she runs out of a studio in London, spans sculpture, interior design, product design and fashion.

Toogood was first inspired by one of Britain's most treasured modernist sculptors, the late Barbara Hepworth, during a family trip to a museum dedicated to her in St. Ives in the southwest of England.

But in a classic tale of near-misses, a teacher at school told her it wasn't a good idea to become a sculptor and that she should broaden her scope. So instead, Toogood earned her degree in art history and started her career as an editor for World of Interiors magazine, stepping stones that would eventually lead her back to that early desire to sculpt.

With a renewed desire to work in 3D, she launched Studio Toogood in 2008, designing interiors for homes and retail spaces first and then adding what she refers to simply as ""objects,"" to her repertoire. The fashion came in 2013, when she launched a clothing collection with her sister Erica, a pattern cutter, who continues to work with her today.

Their debut line was a series of eight canvas coats all named after different working trades including the doorman, the chemist, the oil rigger and the photographer -- a theme she continues to play with now. On her website today, you can purchase a pair of trousers seemingly fashioned for a baker or a dress designed with an astrologer in mind. There's also a hat named after a tinker, a label she sometimes uses to describe herself.

""It's been an amazing story really,"" she said via video call, reflecting back on the 15 collections of clothing she's created since the start, ""a journey of two sisters coming together -- one a sculptor and bit of a tinker, the other a tailor, to make something.""

Making things was a big part of the Toogood upbringing.

""I think that when you're a child you accept your childhood as the norm. But now, in hindsight, I realized that it was more alternative,"" she said. ""My mother made everything -- from all the clothes that we wore to the muesli that we ate, (to) the bread that she baked. She made the curtains, she painted everything herself.""

Her father was an ornithologist (an expert in birds) and as Toogood remembers it, they spent most of their time outdoors in nature. ""I think that harbored a high imagination, a strong imagination, for both me and my sister.""

Today, a little bit of that youthful spirit is woven into the Toogood practice. Her team of some 20 employees -- including architects, fashion designers, graphic designers and sculptors, who she fondly refers to as a ""band of outsiders,"" or a ""series of misfits"" -- approach design in a holistic way, often beginning with constructing shapes out of basic materials in lieu of sketching or creating digital designs.

Before the pandemic hit Europe last year, Toogood was commissioned by Birkenstock to design what has since become a large capsule collection of shoes, clothing and even a bed.

She remembers visiting the Birkenstock headquarters in Germany early on in the collaboration to present some initial designs, with a box of paper, cardboard and fabric shoes (all handmade and hand-stitched) in tow. ""We did a series of sculptures and paintings, all as background (for concepts),"" she said. ""We don't tend to draw in our studio, we go straight to making, and as innocent or as childlike as it is I find it works the best when talking to manufacturers. They get the idea, they get the narrative, they immediately get the concept ... so (Birkenstock) loved it!""

The capsule, which is out now, comprises three different sandals recut, from some of the brand's signature styles, like the Arizona, as well as casual clothing in muted, elemental shades. The bed is a large sculptural design inspired by the classic Birkenstock footbed, the base of the sandal, with its puffed layers of canvas and leather upholstery sitting on a cork foundation.

For those that don't know Toogood's work, the collection reflects her wider ethos and aesthetic. Her designs, be they furniture or fashion, are rooted in fairly rudimentary ideas -- materials and shapes are simple, fuss-free but always striking. It's the type of design you want to run your hand over for all its alluring rounds. Much like a Hepworth sculpture.

Similarly soothing is the studio's new ""Dough"" ceramics range -- a mug, a pitcher, a wide bowl and a platter -- defined by curved edges that seem to mimic a gently rising ball of kneaded flour and water. They express simplicity, comfort and perhaps a kind of calm or wholesomeness that we've all been looking for in our homes during the pandemic.

""Our relationship to our home couldn't be more poignant,"" she said. ""It's no wonder that the home business and the home world is having a huge renaissance right now.""

Toogood appreciates that her products aren't affordable for everyone. It's ""couture design"" for the most part -- and her role, as she sees it, is to push boundaries and come up with concepts that will be emulated, eventually ending up on everyday tables at home, although she notes that collaborations with partners like Birkenstock do make some of her products more accessible and that she is working on other ways to lower the pricing on some of her designs.

When asked to name the most affordable design trick to transform any home, she was quick to respond: paint.

""It sounds really obvious but (buying) pots of paint is the most transformative thing you can do in your home right now...and be courageous with it!""

But, regardless of budget, she believes in the fundamental power of design, as a way to improve a home's environment. ""Having grown up in a make-do-and-mend household I'm a great believer that you can make things beautiful.

""You have to have the imagination and you have to put in a bit more time... but you can create a unique space.""",
"After centuries in the ground, these French oaks will soon form part of the new spire at Notre Dame","Written by Saskya Vandoorne, CNN

Deep in the former royal forest of Bercé, in France's Loire region, a 230-year-old tree comes crashing to the ground with thunderous intensity.

Just a sapling during the French Revolution, the 65-foot-tall oak tree is one of many being felled as part of ongoing efforts to rebuild Notre Dame.

The tree eventually will join 1,000 other oaks being used to reconstruct the wooden lattice of the roof and replace the base of the fallen spire engulfed by the blaze that devastated the Gothic building almost two years ago, in April 2019.

""We know it's the end of something, but it's also the beginning,"" said Pauline Delord, a 15th-generation forest guardian responsible for protecting and managing the forest.

Her colleague Claire Quinones agrees. ""It's the best second life we can give (the tree),"" she said.

Last summer, French president Emmanuel Macron dropped the idea of a contemporary redesign for Notre Dame's 315-foot spire -- originally added by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc in 1859 -- before opting instead for an identical restoration . The decision kickstarted a months-long hunt for the perfect oaks with the potential to meet the exacting demands of architects Philippe Villeneuve and Remi Fromont, who were brought in to oversee the reconstruction process.

This winter, drones were used to scan a snow-dusted forest near Le Mans in search of the first eight trunks that would be used to support the spire. The drones, with the help of 3D imagery, were used to seek out specimens measuring 3 feet wide and over 60 feet tall, with no visible defects. The slender trees in Bercé have a slight curve that makes them ideal for the spire.

The selected trees will be felled before the end of March and dried for 12 to 18 months to make sure the beams won't shrink or move once in place.

According to the army general in charge of the reconstruction of Notre Dame, these trees were planted under King Louis XIV's reign in order to provide wood to build the masts for ships belonging to the French navy.

""We are poor people who only live 60, 70, 80, 100 years maximum. But the trees are here after,"" General Jean-Louis Georgelin said. ""We recognize the humility of the human being in front of the immensity of the universe.""

In addition to the eight oaks coming down in Bercé, more trees have been donated from over 200 forests across the country -- the four corners of France will be represented within the cathedral once building work is complete.

A petition addressed to France's ecology minister has called for a stop to the tree cutting, but forestry groups say the number of trees being felled represents a tiny percentage of the oaks harvested each year in France.

Notre Dame is scheduled to reopen in 2024, but with delays that occurred last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic -- and with large amounts of lead dust at the site posing a contamination risk -- many believe the date set by Macron is unrealistic. General Georgelin, however, remains adamant. ""We will reopen the cathedral in 2024, no doubt about that,"" he said.",
Hong Kong Disneyland's new castle is an architectural vision of diversity,"Written by Elissaveta M. Brandon, CNN

Much has changed in the 55 years since Walt Disney died -- not just in the fortunes of his brand, now one of the world's most influential corporations, but in the characters it creates and the values it promotes.

So, when the company went about building a new fairytale castle at Hong Kong Disneyland, it took into consideration something that would have barely factored into discussions when its first resort opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955: diversity.

The new Castle of Magical Dreams, completed in November and reopened in February after Hong Kong's Covid-19 restrictions loosened, nods to the wider variety of female characters now featured in Disney movies. Unlike the Cinderella Castles in Florida and Tokyo or the Sleeping Beauty Castles in California and Paris -- all of which were partly inspired by the 19th century Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany -- the design represents not just one heroine but over a dozen.

The new structure was built atop the existing Sleeping Beauty Castle, the centerpiece of Hong Kong Disneyland since the resort opened in 2005. As such, Princess Aurora still holds a special place in the new castle, with a tower dedicated to the ""Sleeping Beauty"" protagonist standing the tallest.

But the other 12 towers pay homage to a variety of different princesses, queens and heroines, including historical or folk figures fictionalized by Disney, like the Chinese warrior Mulan and the Native American figure Pocahontas. (Anna and Elsa from ""Frozen"" share a tower between them).

Diversity is also reflected in the eclectic architecture, which sees rose gold domes mixed with embossed turrets and spires. Disney's so-called ""Imagineers"" -- the artists, designers and engineers behind the theme parks -- incorporated the characters' storylines into the design of each tower, such as an apple lattice pattern in Snow White's (""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs""), scalloped detailing for Ariel's (""Little Mermaid"") and a water lily motif for Tiana's (""The Princess and the Frog""). Elsewhere, the structure boasts gold-tipped finials, stained-glass rose windows and columns with hand-carved embellishments.

Design challenges

Hong Kong's original Sleeping Beauty Castle was directly inspired by the first Disneyland resort in California. This castle had been dreamed up in the 1950s by Walt Disney, who envisioned an amusement park for the entire family, complete with a replica of an old-fashioned American main street and distinct ""dreamlands.""

To honor its founder's vision, Disney decided to preserve Hong Kong's Sleeping Beauty Castle when it embarked on a major expansion in 2016 -- instead of demolishing it entirely, designers built atop and around it.

""The original castle is a foundation of Disney, so we wanted to build upon that,"" said Hilcia Pena, a senior architect at Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) in a video interview.

The result is a palimpsest of sorts, where versions of many castles -- the California original, Hong Kong's 2005 replica and the brand-new Castle of Magical Dreams -- come together as one. After the multi-year, 10.9 billion Hong Kong dollar ($1.4 billion) expansion, which also saw the park welcome multiple new attractions, the re-imagined castle is over twice the height of the old one.

According to Pena, this means that the castle is no longer dwarfed by the mountainous landscape of Lantau, the island where Hong Kong Disneyland is located. Imagineers even used helium-filled balloons to help them visualize the height of the prospective structure in relationship to its backdrop. They then used 3D technology to model how the old castle and new castle would connect.

One of the biggest challenges was finding a way to build on top of the existing castle while keeping the park open to visitors. The team landed on modular construction, which sees individual parts of a building, or ""modules,"" constructed in a factory before being transported to the site. In this instance, the castle was built from 15 large parts, each prefabricated, painted and assembled off site. Individual towers and other components were then shipped in and craned into place over a period of three months.

Together, the towers form a mosaic of cultures through color, symbols and patterns, with each offering different elements of their respective characters' worlds. Jasmine's fuchsia tower is embellished with an Arabic fabric pattern and crowned with a turquoise dome. Mulan's tower is embossed with a cherry blossom motif. And Merida's tower is replete with Celtic patterns, a reference to the four clans in the 2012 movie ""Brave.""

Each tower culminates in a gold-tipped finial unique to each character: a golden seashell for Ariel and an enchanted rose for Belle. Meanwhile inside, guests will find 13 columns topped with details dedicated to the protagonists' friends, like Ariel's Flounder and Sebastian, Merida's triplet brothers and Moana's pet pig Pua and rooster HeiHei.

""We're understanding different parts of the world, so we can't just focus on one group, or one princess or one location,"" said Pena. ""Our stories continue to grow, and we get to learn about different cultures around the world. So how do we put that into the buildings and stories we try to tell?""

The only direct depictions of the 14 heroines are found inside, where Imagineers designed bronze statues of each one. Their evolution -- from Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, whose lives rely on a man's kiss, to assured and empowered characters like Merida and Moana -- tells a story about how Disney has repositioned itself over the years. But even the older characters' statues have been designed with contemporary values in mind.

""Instead of portraying them in a very submissive way, we portrayed them (all) as powerful women in a very engaging pose,"" said Amanda Chiu, a producer with WDI Asia, pointing to the depiction of Ariel standing proudly as she exercises her newfound freedom and Jasmine riding solo on the magic carpet.

Local inspiration

In line with the characters' origins, Imagineers drew inspiration from Europe, China and the Pacific Islands. ""A European castle has one style and the same detailing everywhere,"" said Pena. ""This one has different architectural styles -- even the domes are very different in style.""

It is fitting, perhaps, that such an eclectic castle exists in Hong Kong, one of Asia's more diverse cities. ""Hong Kong is a city of rich cultural fabric and cultural diversity,"" said Chiu, who was born and raised in the territory.

As well as taking inspiration from around the world, Disneyland Hong Kong was also built according to the principles of feng shui, an important aspect of design and architecture in parts of Asia. Based on an ancient Chinese system, the ancient practice involves positioning objects or buildings in relation to one another and their surroundings to encourage happiness and good fortune. In 2005, for instance, the angle of the resort's front gate was shifted by 12 degrees in the belief that it would keep positive energy, or ""chi,"" flowing through the park. Feng shui also informed the design of the new castle.

""Feng shui is about the balance of the five elements,"" said Chiu, referring to wood, fire, earth, metal and water. ""We want to draw on that harmony and apply that to castle.""

Wood and earth are symbolized by the castle's landscaping -- a mix of living plants and artificial foliage -- which helps it blend in with its surroundings; fire will be used in pyrotechnic shows at night; metal can be found in the towers' gold finials; and water is used in the castle's moat and dancing fountains. ""All of these elements come together in good harmony,"" Chiu added.

While still rooted in tradition of sorts, Hong Kong's Castle of Magical Dreams nonetheless symbolizes Disney's attempts to modernize. With an increasingly global customer base, and several resorts in Asia, diversity might not just be a matter of values but good business, too.

'The Candy Book' and 5 other reads that defy 'outdated rules of gender',"Kristen Rogers , CNN Written by

Keeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.

Transgender, gender-nonconforming, nonbinary, crossdressing and androgynous people, and drag queens, inspired and contributed to the fashion industry for years.

said. But they hadn't been honored for their contributions, Candy magazine creative director and publisher Luis Venegassaid.

That's why he launched Candy in 2009 -- to focus on what he calls transversal people: those who are ""defying the outdated rules of gender,"" a group for whom clothing and makeup can be quite meaningful.

""I wanted it to be glamorous and the same thing as Vogue magazine is, only focus on a group of people who, at the time, possibly weren't going to make the cut to be in Vogue,"" said Venegas, who is also the magazine's editor.

That same year, International Transgender Day of Visibility was created to not only raise awareness of the discrimination faced by transgender people, but also to celebrate them annually on March 31.

Times are a little different now, for some: Caitlyn Jenner, an American television personality and retired Olympian, made her public debut on Vanity Fair's cover in 2015. RuPaul, an American drag queen and TV personality, starred on Vogue's cover in 2019.

Candy magazine had no precedent, according to Venegas, but had been successfully surviving for a decade by then. Creating "" The C☆ndy Book of Transversal Creativity ,"" published in 2020, is how he celebrated the anniversary.

Compiled from what Venegas considered the best content from the magazine's first 12 issues, ""The C☆ndy Book of Transversal Creativity"" showcases photography and art by more than 100 artists, including David Armstrong, Naomi Harris, Bruce Weber and Cole Sprouse. Geena Rocero and Amos Mac are among the culturally influential transgender people who contributed insightful essays to the book.

Though deviating from gender binaries has been more accepted in recent years, many people remain uninformed about what this means — resulting in societal division, online and in-person discrimination , facile media representation and policies that harm rather than help them. ""The C☆ndy Book of Transversal Creativity"" represents people of varying body types, races or ethnicities, ages, and gender performances.

Acknowledging the stylish aspects of some transgender communities is ""always fun,"" but the natural expressions of ""trans people run the gamut from boring to fabulous,"" said Linda Simpson, an entertainer and author of the book "" The Drag Explosion ,"" whose photography of and writing about the New York drag scene in the 1980s and 1990s is featured in Venegas' book.

One Candy Magazine issue included a 62-page profile on transgender stars such as actress Laverne Cox and Janet Mock. ""The C☆ndy Book"" features a portion. Credit: Candy Magazine/Rizzoli New York

Dr. Rachel Levine, the new US assistant secretary of health and the first out transgender federal official ""doesn't put incredible emphasis on fashion,"" Simpson said. Simultaneously, ""you've got models walking on the runways of Paris and Milan that are transgender. So, like all communities, there's a real wide range of expression and bodies.""

Trans people have often been portrayed as exotic, perverted and monstrous, Simpson said. ""To have a magazine or book showing trans people as glamorous and chic and sexy is really empowering in many ways, and certainly a wake-up call for some people.""

Celebrating these communities during this year's International Transgender Day of Visibility and year-round, as well as highlighting their societal and political struggles, is important, Venegas said.

""There's lots of lack of knowledge in general in all the rest of society,"" he said. ""The more we know about all kinds of transversal manifestation and all kinds of transversal creativity, the more knowledge (the world will have).""

Chinese celebrities rush to defend Beijing's Xinjiang policy by cutting ties with international brands,"Nectar Gan , CNN Written by

Chinese celebrities are finding it increasingly difficult to stay out of politics.

Due to China's tight restrictions on free speech, most of the country's stars have been outwardly apolitical by default. But as China embraces a new wave of apparent nationalism -- promoted by the ruling Communist Party and amplified by state media -- it seems staying silent is no longer a viable option.

Over the past two days, Chinese actors, singers and models have spoken up en masse to defend Beijing's policy on Xinjiang, as a nationalist-fueled backlash erupted against some international clothing brands for expressing concerns over allegations of forced labor, and refusing to use cotton produced in the western region.

Human rights groups have accused Beijing of detaining Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in internment camps across Xinjiang, and using them for forced labor, which they claim is part of global tech and retail supply chains, either directly or indirectly.

Recent sanctions from the United States and other Western countries over Xinjiang have sparked a renewed pushback from the Chinese government, which calls the camps ""vocational training centers"" designed to combat terrorism and religious extremism. China has repeatedly and vehemently denied accusations of forced labor in the camps.

In December, the US government said it would block imports of cotton produced in Xinjiang over concerns it ""may have been made by slave labor in some of the most egregious human rights violations existing today.""

accused of ""smearing"" cotton produced in Xinjiang, including H&M, Nike, Adidas, Puma and Calvin Klein. However, in a striking move this week, more than 30 Chinese celebrities have ended their promotional partnerships or said they would cut ties with brands theyaccused of ""smearing"" cotton produced in Xinjiang, including H&M, Nike, Adidas, Puma and Calvin Klein.

The scale of the celebrity exodus is unprecedented -- so much so that on Chinese social media, March 25 has been dubbed ""contract termination day"" among China's entertainment circles.

Other celebrities also showed allegiance by sharing the hashtag ""I support Xinjiang's cotton,"" which has been viewed nearly 5 billion times since it was posted Wednesday by party mouthpiece People's Daily on Weibo, China's heavily-censored version of Twitter.

The collective support from celebrities is just the latest example of the role they are expected to play in an ever more nationalistic China -- that of vocal defenders of the country's actions, even if it means sacrificing their own business opportunities.

While some of them are more than happy to speak out, either because of their genuine support for the government or the pragmatic belief that doing so could benefit their careers, others simply cannot afford to stay silent under intense online pressure and public scrutiny.

'A nation's dignity is not to be violated'

The latest outrage comes after the Party's youth wing, the Communist Youth League, on Wednesday posted an old statement from H&M, about Xinjiang on Weibo. In the statement, which was released in September 2020, H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, said that it was ""deeply concerned"" over reports of forced labor in the production of cotton in Xinjiang and that it had stopped buying cotton from growers in the region.

In the Weibo post, the Communist Youth League denounced the company's stance. ""Spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton while trying to make a profit in China? Wishful thinking!"" it said

Actor Huang Xuan, who had been a brand ambassador for H&M since last April, announced soon after that he would no longer work with the company. Another H&M ambassador, Song Qian, followed with a similar announcement.

But the public ire did not stop at H&M. Social media users found a statement from Nike, published nearly a year ago, that said it was ""concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, Xinjiang.""

As the outrage spread to Nike, its brand ambassador Wang Yibo came under fire for not immediately cutting ties with the company. Amid growing criticism over his silence, Wang's agency eventually announced on Thursday morning that the star had ended all cooperation with the sportswear brand.

""Our agency and Mr. Wang resolutely resist any remark and action that smears China. A nation's dignity is not to be violated. (We) resolutely safeguard the motherland's interest,"" the statement said.

Throughout Thursday, more and more celebrities followed suit, cutting ties with fashion brands linked to the Better Cotton Initiative, a non-profit group based in Geneva and London, that promotes sustainable cotton production, which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang, citing human rights concerns.

Political liability

Partnering with famous Western brands has long been a coveted business opportunity -- they can be lucrative and help Chinese celebrities gain international clout. For the brands themselves, tapping into the world's largest luxury market via stars with followings in the millions, is good for business.

But in recent years, these seemingly innocuous deals come with greater risk for stars.

In 2018, Italian luxury brand Dolce & Gabbana ignited an outcry in China after releasing promotional videos featuring an Asian model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks, drawing accusations of racism. To make matters worse, one of its co-founders was then accused of making derogatory remarks about Chinese people as he defended the ads in private Instagram messages (the Italian designer denied posting them, insisting his account was hacked).

Amid the outrage that followed, two of D&G's Asia Pacific brand ambassadors, singer and actor Wang Junkai and actress Dilraba Dilmurat, terminated their contracts with the luxury label.

""The motherland is absolutely not to be violated. The motherland is above everything,"" Wang's representative office said in a statement at the time.

In 2019, during the height of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, luxury fashion houses Coach, Versace and Givenchy were accused by Chinese consumers of undermining the country's sovereignty by designing T-shirts that listed Hong Kong and Macau -- China's two special administrative regions -- as countries.

Following the uproar, a slew of Chinese celebrities, including model Liu Wen and actress Yang Mi, quickly cut ties with the fashion brands.

In other instances, Chinese stars have been affected by politics as a result of direct orders from the Chinese government.

In 2019, China's film regulator blocked the mainland's movie industry from participating in Taiwan's Golden Horse awards, dubbed the ""Chinese-language Oscars,"" amid rising tensions between Beijing and the self-ruled democratic island.

The ban came after the event, stirred questions about Taiwan's independence in late 2018, when a Taiwanese best documentary winner said she hoped the territory would ""one day be treated as a genuine independent entity.""

The black and red sneakers, part of a collaboration between Lil Nas X and New York-based art collective MSCHF , were made using Nike Air Max 97s, though the sportswear brand has distanced itself from the design

In an emailed statement to CNN, Nike said it was not involved in creating the modified sneakers. ""We do not have a relationship with Lil Nas or MSCHF,"" the company said. ""Nike did not design or release these shoes and we do not endorse them.""

MSCHF confirmed via email March 29 that the limited-edition ""drop"" of 666 pairs sold out in less than a minute (though Lil Nas X will keep the first pair, MSCHF creative director Kevin Wiesner told CNN).

They were priced at $1,018 a pair, a reference to the Bible passage Luke 10:18 that reads: ""I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."" Each shoe's air bubble sole contains 60 cubic centimeters (2.03 fluid ounces) of red ink and ""one drop"" of human blood, according to MSCHF.

A MSCHF spokesperson said the blood had been provided by members of the art collective, adding: ""We love to sacrifice for our art."" Later, Wiesner explained on a video call that the creative team collected individual drops over the course of a week using the same type of needle used in at-home glucose tests. The group also confirmed to CNN that Nike was ""not involved in this in any capacity.""

The shoes sparked outrage online over the weekend, and attracted criticism from a number of high-profile political and religious figures, including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and the evangelical pastor Mark Burns. The latter described the sneakers in a tweet as ""evil"" and ""heresy."" Some fans of the ""Old Town Road"" rapper, meanwhile, tweeted their support and desire to own a pair.

In response, Lil Nas X (whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill), posted a video to his official YouTube account titled ""Lil Nas X Apologizes for Satan Shoe,"" which has now been viewed over 1.8 million times. But after a few seconds, the apparent apology cuts to a scene from his new music video, ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name),"" showing him dancing provocatively with a devil character. The rapper is then pictured snapping the devil's neck, before removing his horned crown and assuming it himself.

The day after Lil Nas X released the music video, he responded to the backlash over its rebellious religious imagery. ""I spent my entire teenage years hating myself because of the s**t y'all preached would happen to me because i was gay,"" he wrote. ""So i hope u are mad, stay mad, feel the same anger you teach us to have towards ourselves.""

""We all knew that some people would take the satan element of this seriously...but I'm not sure we were entirely prepared for how much of a furor it would cause,"" Wiesner said.

"World's first digital NFT house sells for $500,000","Written by Lianne Kolirin, CNN

Having spent so much time at home over the last year, many people are craving a change in their surroundings.

But if a coat of paint or some creative renovations fail to do the trick, there is now a more extreme alternative: The digital house.

Mars House, the world's first digital NFT (non-fungible token) home, has recently sold for more than $500,000.

NFTs have made headlines recently, allowing digital art and other musings such as drawings or music to be sold online.

An NFT is a unique digital token which effectively verifies authenticity and ownership. It is encrypted with the artist's signature on the blockchain, a digital ledger used in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

The new owner paid digital artist Krista Kim 288 Ether -- a cryptocurrency that is equivalent to $514,557.79 -- for the virtual property.

In exchange, the buyer will receive 3D files to upload to his or her ""Metaverse.""

Metaverse is a virtual extension of our world, Kim told CNN Tuesday, where plots of virtual land are purchased and traded, and digital homes and business are built.

There is a market for digital assets such as fashion and accessories and users can live and interact in a Metaverse through their digital avatar.

Kim said the concept behind the house was ""inspired by being locked down during the pandemic.""

Kim, who describes herself as a ""Techism artist,"" told CNN: ""Mars House represents the next generation of NFTs. It is a sign of things to come, as we enter an AR (augmented reality) interfaced future, with the launch of Apple AR glasses and AR contact lenses.

""Art, NFTs, cryptocurrencies... these sweeping changes and ideas of how we will live with digital assets is becoming a reality and will create a global paradigm shift.

""Also, after being confined due to Covid-19, we need more innovative ideas on how our interior environments can heal us, as mental health has become a primary concern for all.""

The house is intended ""to omit a zen, healing atmosphere,"" Kim said in a post on Instagram earlier this month.

The artist said that she partnered with musician Jeff Schroeder of The Smashing Pumpkins to create a calming musical accompaniment.

Record-breaking month for NFTs

The sale was made last week -- adding to what has been a record-breaking month for NFTs.

World's largest canvas painting fetches $62M at Dubai charity auction,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

The world's largest canvas painting has sold at a Dubai auction for almost 228 million dirham ($62 million), putting it among the most expensive artworks ever to go under the hammer.

Measuring over 17,000 square feet, ""The Journey of Humanity"" is roughly equivalent in size to four NBA-regulation basketball courts.

The work was created by British painter Sacha Jafri in order to raise money for children affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Having cut the work into 70 parts, Jafri had initially intended to sell the panels separately in the hope of making a combined $30 million. But at a charity auction on Monday, Dubai-based businessman Andre Abdoune offered more than double that to buy them all.

The sale puts Jafri's name among the world's most expensive living artists. The $62 million raised by ""The Journey of Humanity"" has only been beaten at auction by the works of Jeff Koons, David Hockney and the digital artist Beeple, whose NFT image ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days"" sold via Christie's for over $69 million earlier this month.

As part of Jafri's Humanity Inspired initiative, proceeds from the auction will be donated to UNICEF, UNESCO, The Global Gift Foundation and Dubai Cares for programs related to children's education, health care, sanitation and digital connectivity. In a press release issued by Dubai Cares, Jafri described the sale as ""a moment for humanity.""

""At the beginning of my 'Humanity Inspired' initiative, I had a vision to reconnect our broken planet through the hearts, minds and souls of the children of the world,"" he is quoted as saying. ""I feel in my heart that we have come one step closer to achieving this tonight, thanks to Andre.""

Record-breaking feat

The artwork holds the Guinness World Record for the world's largest art canvas. It was created in a ballroom at the Atlantis The Palm hotel in Dubai, where Jafri was based when the United Arab Emirates introduced lockdown measures to control the spread of Covid-19 last year.

""I was stuck in Dubai and I wanted to create something poignant, something that would mean something,"" he told CNN last year , prior to completing the artwork. ""Something that could potentially make a really big difference.""

Related video: Sacha Jafri speaks to CNN upon the painting's completion last year.

Taking seven months to complete, the painting features abstract brushwork and drip-painting in a style Jafri dubs ""magical realism."" The canvas was divided into four connected segments, with the first representing ""the soul of the Earth,"" and the others alluding to nature, humanity and the wider universe, Jafri said.

The painter, who was educated at the elite British boarding school Eton alongside Prince William, had also called for children around the world to contribute their own artworks centered on the themes of connection, separation and isolation during the pandemic. The submissions were printed out on paper and incorporated into the huge canvas.

""I asked the children of the world to send in their artworks -- how they feel now, their emotions,"" he explained last year. ""We, as adults, are finding this hard. We found the last five months very difficult, very confusing, very frustrating and quite scary. But imagine how a 4-year-old child feels.""

Abdoune, the artwork's new owner, said in a press statement that the ""investment and love"" Jafri put into the painting was ""so amazing.""

""All my life I was aiming to help children,"" he said. ""When I was a child, I had nothing to eat. Now I have something to eat. We all have to do something.""

Parts of the artwork will be on display at Jafri's career retrospective, which is currently showing at the Leila Heller Gallery in Dubai.

AI photo restoration shines a light on life in old Ireland,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Thousands of historical images from across Ireland are being brought to life in color for the first time, thanks to a new AI-led photo project.

Combining digital technology with painstaking historical research, professors John Breslin and Sarah-Anne Buckley at the National University of Ireland, Galway, have been able to turn photos, originally shot in black in white, into rich color images.

The collection spans centuries and regions of Ireland, as well as the country's diaspora. It includes portraits of key figures like Oscar Wilde and poet W.B. Yeats, as well as defining moments in history, like the Titanic setting sail from the Belfast shipyard where it was constructed.

Yet, some of the most compelling photos depict everyday scenes -- people herding pigs, spinning wool or packed onto the back of horse-drawn carts. And while poverty is evident in pictures of barefoot villagers crowding around for a photo, or of Dublin's working-class tenement buildings, there are also well-to-do family shots and depictions of upper-class pastimes like fox hunting.

""There were many different social classes in Ireland, as in many countries, so I think it's important to show the full range,"" said Breslin in a phone interview from Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. ""We have a mixture of the wealthier classes and the gentry, and then you've got people who are just trying to survive and gather water and turf (peat) to burn on their fires.""

The project, ""Old Ireland in Colour,"" now has dedicated social media accounts with tens of thousands of followers. A new book of the same title is also bringing together more than 170 of the images, painting a compelling picture of life on the island from the 1840s through to the 1960s.

An entire section of the book is dedicated to the Irish revolutionary period, which spans from the early 1910s to 1923. This image shows Dublin's city center in ruins following the Easter Rising of 1916. Credit: Courtesy of Merrion Press

Deep learning

The project began when Breslin started experimenting with old photographs of his grandparents for a personal genealogy project. After discovering an AI-powered colorization tool, DeOldify, he started applying the technique to photos from archives and libraries across Ireland.

Using a process known as deep learning, AI software can be taught how to colorize. The ""training"" involves analyzing thousands of normal color photos, as well as black and white versions of the same images, to help it understand which colors correlate to different shapes and textures, explained Breslin, who specializes in engineering and computer science.

Then, when the software encounters an image that only exists in black and white, it knows ""what the colors should probably be,"" he said. ""So, for example, the grass or trees or the sea -- it knows from those textures and shapes that they should be green or blue.""

AI has its limitations, however. There were certain idiosyncrasies to life in Ireland that the US-developed software was not trained to recognize.

""An average kind of color (of a roof), around the world, might be a terracotta, an orange or a kind of a brownish-type tile,"" Breslin said. ""Whereas in Ireland, the roofs were typically slate, which is gray or black.""

This is where his collaborator, Buckley, who specializes in Irish social history, came in. The pair researched everything from clothing and pigments available in Ireland at the time, to the uniforms worn by various military units, before manually changing colors and shades based on what they found.

The project also features photos of Irish people overseas, such as this 1911 image from an expedition to Antarctica. Credit: Courtesy of Merrion Press

For a photo of revolutionary politician Constance Markievicz, they even consulted passenger records from New York's Ellis Island -- where she was processed among the millions of Irish immigrants arriving in America between the 1890s and 1950s -- to determine that her true eye color was blue.

Colorization debate

Despite the painstaking approach taken by the two researchers, photo colorization remains controversial among academics. Some historians believe software like DeOldify can produce misleading results that obfuscate, rather than enhance, the content of old photographs.

But the practice is ""nothing new,"" Breslin said, adding that people have been colorizing photos ""since the advent of photography,"" albeit without the help of AI or other software like Photoshop. He also argued that his images exist in addition to, not instead of, the originals.

The eviction of farmers by their landlords -- as depicted in this scene, from the village of Woodford -- was the source of huge controversy in 1880s Ireland. Credit: Courtesy of Merrion Press

""We're not vandalizing the negatives,"" he said. ""You can always go back and find the original photograph, and throughout the book we provide pointers to the original collection.""

In making old images more accessible, Breslin hopes his and Buckley's project can help engage people who may not otherwise be interested in history. If the success of their book so far is anything to go by (though not released in North America until next month, it was among Ireland's best-selling titles in 2020), he may well be right.

""We're being bombarded with so much information, knowledge, bite-sized media and content, so, for the younger generation particularly, it can be hard for history to compete,"" Breslin said. ""It's important to be able to relate more to our history, and colorization definitely makes things more relatable.""",
A photographer shows the beauty of their transition through vivid self-portraits,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Several months after photographer Laurence Philomène began testosterone hormone therapy as part of their transition, they began to take pictures of themselves at home. This was in 2018, and Philomène, was concerned about burnout, so they took two months off from work to focus on self-care.

Establishing a portrait practice became part of their daily routine: They photographed themselves making breakfast or brushing their teeth; they took nude self-portraits against their home's baby blue walls or while wearing a fairytale princess gown in bed. All these images are made more vibrant by the presence of Philomène's signature neon orange hair.

What began as a simple impulse to chronicle a period of physical and mental change has become an archive of thousands of images and now a forthcoming book, ""Puberty,"" set to be released this summer.

The artist began the series while facing intense feelings of burnout. ""I was in a place where I had been prioritizing other people's needs and I really needed to relearn how to take basic care of myself,"" they said. Credit: Laurence Philomene

""Puberty"" captures all the intimate details of daily life in lush color, and the photographer often interrupts the mundane with the unexpected. Philomène sits in the lilac-tinted water of a bathtub, eyes downcast, sipping from a mug. They recline on a couch like Ingres' famous 19th-century painting of a concubine, ""Grande Odalisque,"" gazing over their shoulder at the camera. In one image, their hand holds a peach in the dappled morning light; in another frame, echoing that composition, they hold a medical syringe with hormones above an overturned plush Care Bear.

On one level these photos are about the photographer's personal experience of transitioning. At the same time, Philomène's images capture what has become a globalized human experience, as the difficulties of self-care at home and the pressures of productivity have grown more relevant during the coronavirus pandemic.

""(Puberty) is about my transition, but it's also just these themes that resonate really deeply with being a human in the 21st century,"" said Philomène in a video interview from their home in Montreal.

The beauty of fluidity

In the mid-2010s, as celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox were landing magazine covers, Philomène saw how trans beauty was being framed in a specific way.

""I felt like a lot of it was very much focused on this idea of passing as your gender and transitioning in a very binary sense,"" the artist said. ""That really wasn't representative of the trans community that I was a part of, which was a lot more fluid.""

Philomène began spending alone time taking baths during quarantine. Many of the themes they explore in ""Puberty"" became even more universal during the coronavirus pandemic. Credit: Laurence Philomene

Philomène is non-binary and sees photography as ""a space where you can play around with gender,"" they said. Much of their work has focused on studio portraits and documentary-style images of gender nonconforming youth, though self-portraits have always been part of their practice. In the 2019 series ""Huldufólk,"" they appear nude, embedded in various desolate landscapes in Iceland, as a way to evoke the country's folk history of elves, called ""hidden people,"" and compare the ever-shifting terrain to a human body in perpetual change.

In ""Me vs Others,"" a series they shot from 2014-2019, they cast people of different genders and ethnicities to play themselves, each wearing a wig to assume Philomène's identity. The staged portraits of the doppelgangers are often tongue-in-cheek, with objects like oranges and Cheetos becoming symbols for the artist as well.

""Puberty"" also incudes still lifes of the ephemera of the home, painting a more complete picture of what the artist sees every day. Credit: Laurence Philomene

Now 27 years old, Philomène grew up during the mid 2000s, and as a teenager was just as influenced by the photo-sharing platform Flickr as they were by Wolfgang Tillmans's effervescent snapshots of youth culture, or Nan Goldin's diaristic depictions of intimacy.

""I just have a lot of nostalgia for (the Flickr era), because (social media) wasn't fully formed in the way that it is with capitalism now,"" Philomène said. ""I wasn't trying to sell anything. When I was 14 posting on Flickr we were just trying to make cute pictures.""

Philomène was diagnosed with a chronic illness when still a child, and at age 11, they began dyeing their hair to assert a sense of control over their body, the artist recalled. Living with an illness for so much of their life has greatly informed their work today, they said -- a sentiment that resonates with some of its major themes: how one cares for their body, and how one's sense of self is more than their appearance.

""Representation is not the end all be all,"" the artist said. ""My goal at the end of the day isn't just to represent a trans life, but to really...create a sense of connection."" Credit: Laurence Philomene

""Lately, my sense of self is expanding beyond the physical body,"" the artist said. ""(I've been) thinking of myself as a being having a human experience and wanting to communicate what that feels like outside of what I look like.""

Philomène hopes to tap into some of the experiences human beings share, and encourage self-reflection. ""(I want to) inspire people to see beauty in their day-to-day lives,"" they said. ""Because that's really what the project is all about at the end of the day.""",
The Native American couple redefining cultural norms -- in photos,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Challenging binaries and stereotypes, ""Swing"" is a pop-up series that paints a nuanced portrait of America through photography of the day-to-day lives of overlooked people and communities.

In the summer of 2019, as an overcast sky hung over Minnesota's Prairie Island Indian Community, photographer and filmmaker Tomás Karmelo Amaya took a portrait of a couple kissing while wearing colorful regalia.

The couple, Nevada-based dancers Adrian Matthias Stevens and Sean Snyder, were visiting the reservation to dance in the Tinta Wita Wacipi powwow, a tradition that brought them together -- and a tradition in which they are now making history.

Stevens, who is of Northern Ute, Shoshone-Bannock and San Carlos Apache heritage; and Snyder, who is of Southern Ute and Navajo heritage, are a Two-Spirit couple that have been together for seven years. Within North American Indigenous communities, Two-Spirit refers to people who possess both masculine and feminine spirits, but it can also be used to represent LGBTQ+ Indigenous people more broadly.

""It's not biological, it's spiritual, and it ties back to what I was taught growing up,"" Stevens told Vogue in 2020. ""My aunties recognized me as a Two-Spirit individual way before I even recognized it.""

Through his images of the pair, Amaya shows their bond and the beauty of their movement. When Stevens and Snyder met, they were both dancers on Utah's powwow circuit but it took years for them to perform couples routines -- called ""sweetheart specials"" -- together. That category was exclusively performed by male and female dancers until 2018, when they became the first Two-Spirit pair to do so, after being disqualified from a dance the year prior.

""Because our styles are so different, we had to find a way to dance together,"" Snyder is quoted as saying in Vogue . ""And for us being two men, it was surprisingly difficult. You don't grow up going to dances and learning to dance with another same-sex partner. We had to learn how to lead and how to take direction.""

Since then, their routines and matching regalia -- each embellished with their own handmade beadwork -- have brought them widespread attention. In 2019, a short documentary telling their story, ""Sweetheart Dancers,"" was shown at the PBS Short Film Festival.

For Amaya, who is of Yoeme, A:shiwi, and Rarámuri Indigenous descent, the shoot was particularly resonant. ""We see front and center this beautiful expression of love between (them),"" said Amaya, reflecting on a portrait he took of Stevens and Snyder kissing. ""(It's) a beautiful, proud moment. Because this is the type of safe environment we need to create for our youth and for our future ancestors, as well as a lot of our community members who have faced a lot of discrimination and oppression, and because of systems that are constantly negating their existence.""

Creating 'visual medicine'

It was dance that brought Amaya and the Two-Spirit couple together. After a shoot in another part of the state, Amaya and his wife and business partner, Siera Begaye, decided to drive to the powwow in Prairie Island. Begaye, who also dances, had previously met Stevens and Snyder, and Amaya photographed the couple while they were waiting to hear the results of the categories they had performed in separately that day.

Amaya remembers speaking with Stevens and Snyder about their hope to provide a network of support for LGBTQ+ Indigenous people. ""Sean, Adrian and I had very meaningful conversations about the importance of visibility for our Two-Spirit relatives, for our gender-nonconforming relatives, and our trans relatives within the Indigenous community ... our Indigenous communities included this entire spectrum of sexuality and expression far before it was in this system of settler colonialism.""

Calling his images ""visual medicine,"" Amaya believes that photographs have the potential to heal. ""Sometimes it feels like it exists almost in an intangible way, where I know I'm doing healing work. I know the intention is there,"" he said. ""And then there are moments like receiving a message from a community member saying, 'This particular photo made me feel seen, it made me feel safe. It made me really proud.' Then I started feeling like it's not just in my mind -- there's real impact and effect.""",
New York's radical female and non-binary skateboarders -- in photos,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Though Jordana Bermúdez isn't a skateboarder, she found a sense of community at a skate park on Manhattan's Lower East Side.

The photographer, who relocated from Mexico City to New York City in 2019, grew up roller skating and biking. And it was in Coleman Playground, a stretch of concrete near the waterfront populated with ledges and grind rails, that she felt familiarity amid the unknowns of her new city.

""I grew up going to parks, and surrounded by these people,"" Bermúdez said over video. ""And I felt safer there.""

She was particularly intrigued by the number of women and non-binary skaters testing tricks and sharing laughs. Since watching Bing Liu's ""Minding the Gap,"" a 2018 documentary about male friendships strengthened by skateboarding, Bermúdez had been interested in the skate culture and identity among those who don't identify as male.

Bermúdez, who moved to New York to study at the International Center of Photography, began attending meet-ups organized by two groups: GRLSWIRL, a skate community that began in Venice Beach, California, and Quell, a female-founded media, magazine and podcast brand aiming to ""increase visibility for nontraditional skateboarders."" These groups both formed with the intention of providing a safe space for women and gender-nonconforming riders in a sport that is still dominated by men. Bermúdez was quickly pulled into their orbit.

""I couldn't stop (photographing),"" Bermúdez said. ""I followed my intuition, and I started going four times a week.""

Her ensuing multimedia project, ""Girls Can't Skate,"" was shot over the course of nearly a year and comprises still portraits, GIFs and, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in New York, video interviews and virtual photo shoots. By shifting from in-person photographs to Zoom shoots, she could visit people's homes in an instant, taking pictures of skaters in Arizona and California, in Brazil and Norway.

Though not a skater herself, Bermúdez has become a fixture in the scene, and is even roommates with one of her subjects.

""It's just so natural to be part of the community,"" she said. ""They're very welcoming and inclusive.""

Strength through diversity

Skateboarding has become a cultural force around the world, spreading from its birthplace in Southern California to inspire thriving communities as far afield as South Africa, Afghanistan and Japan. In Tokyo, where the rescheduled 2020 Summer Olympics are set to take place this summer, skateboarding will be represented for the first time, and will include both men's and women's street and park competitions.

Though women have long been a part of skateboarding, they are not afforded the same visibility or professional opportunities as men -- and the gap is even more glaring for gender-nonconforming riders.

The rosters of professional skate teams are still nearly all male, but recent years have seen a handful of firsts for professional female and non-binary skaters. In 2015, Leticia Bufoni became the first female skater to sign for the Nike SB team, and she was joined two years later by non-binary skater Leo Baker. In 2016, Nora Vasconcellos became the first woman to join the Adidas skateboarding team, and in 2017, Samarria Brevard became the first Black woman to sign with skate brand Enjoi.

In amateur skateboarding, female and LGBTQ+ riders are also carving out a space for themselves, forming groups that promote support, solidarity and safety. As well as GRLSWIRL and Quell in the United States, they include Nefarious Skate Crew in London, Skate Gal Club in Ghana and Girl Skate India

Adrian Koenigsberg, director of Quell, said that she has witnessed a significant change in attitudes -- even in the short time since she founded the brand in 2017.

""When I started Quell, the conversation around gender was nowhere near what it is now,"" she said over email. ""We were focused on women in skateboarding but now our language has shifted to focus on marginalized genders. When we support others, we make a stronger community.""

Female skateboarders have seen increased presence on screen as well, with a 2019 documentary about young Afghan skaters, ""Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You're a Girl),"" winning an Oscar last year, and HBO's teen comedy ""Betty,"" which follows a group of girl skaters in New York City, debuting last May.

Thriving under restraints

While the Olympics are bound to bring more riders to the sport, the ongoing pandemic has also caused an uptick in interest , as people seek out new kinds of outdoor recreation and alternative ways to commute. In New York, Koenigsberg has seen the effects firsthand.

""I think the amount of people skating since the pandemic has increased tremendously,"" she said. ""There are more non-male-identifying people absolutely killing skating than ever. There are so many people organizing their own events all over the city.""

As the community continues to widen, male skaters are becoming more welcoming, according to Kristen Miller, founder of GRLSWIRL's New York chapter. ""Not too long ago, I would always be the only girl at my local skatepark. 'Men' would be super aggressive and snake my lines or get in my way on purpose and I would always be the one apologizing, feeling like I was always in their way,"" she said over email.

""As the tides have changed this year, I've noticed these same men have learned to take a step back and allow their fellow skaters more space at the park (and) they apologize when they accidentally get in our way. (They) see that there are more GRLS than ever before, skating and taking up space, and are showing more respect towards us.""",
Real-world locations straight out of a Wes Anderson movie,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Rounded edges, pastel colors and satisfying symmetry -- there is something unmistakable about a Wes Anderson movie.

For more than two decades, the director has crafted a unique aesthetic through quirky films like ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel.""

So, when travel enthusiast Wally Koval began noticing real-world locations that looked straight out of a Wes Anderson movie, he started an Instagram account in 2017 to document them all. Three years and 1.3 million followers later, @accidentallywesanderson boasts over 1,200 submissions from around the world.

Despite its seemingly niche brief, the cult account features everything from minimalist lighthouses to grandiose hotels, from Art Deco bathhouses to mountain cabins. All, however, are distinctly reminiscent of Anderson's oeuvre.

""He has created these very specific worlds, these fantastical worlds that are very perfectly placed,"" Koval explained in a video interview. ""They feel otherworldly, to a degree. They're real, but they're not right. They could exist at any point in time, or any place, potentially.""

Such was the account's success that Koval has now published a book containing 200 of his favorite images. As much a travel guide as a show of photography, the submissions are divided by geographical region and span the farthest corners of the Earth -- including tiny post offices in Alaska and Antarctica, and a powder-pink metro station in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.

While the publication is, ostensibly, about Anderson, Koval said the director is really just a lens through which to see design and architecture around the world.

""The name brings you through the door,"" he added. ""But once you're in, I don't think you'd go anywhere.""

Unexpected places

Some of the featured locations will feel familiar to Anderson fans: a funicular in the Swiss Alps, the wooden interior of a Norwegian railway carriage, the ornate facade of a Renaissance Revival hotel in Prague. (Not Budapest, but close enough.) Others, however, demonstrate an ability to see the eccentric director's vision in the unlikeliest of places.

Take, for example, the image of Beijing's National Stadium, better known as the Bird's Nest. To most, the structure's bulking mass and latticed concrete shell would seem far from Anderson-esque. Yet, with some selective cropping and favorable light, the neat colored seats and pristine turf take on an entirely new appearance.

""There's this layer or level of subjectivity that comes along with each location,"" Koval said. ""Maybe the light or wind hit a building just right, or there's some intangible thing that happened and (the photographer) stopped to take a photo ... They're adding substance and context to the world that we (otherwise) just walk past, or let go by in our periphery and just ignore.""

As such, Koval is effusive in his praise for what he calls the ""AWA community."" He now receives as many as 3,500 submissions a month through a dedicated Accidentally Wes Anderson website

""They're the most important part of this project,"" Koval said of his contributors. ""Without them, this doesn't exist.""

Power of stories

In the years since 2017, when Koval and his wife Amanda started cataloging the photos as a bucket list for their own travels, Accidentally Wes Anderson has taken on its own unique identity beyond that of the director's work, Koval said.

Placing the project at ""the intersection of distinctive design and unexpected narratives,"" he encourages photographers to accompany their submissions with stories about the locations and how they encountered them.

""There are a lot of pretty pictures out there, but I think the story that exists around them is what provides real context and real meaningful impact for whatever experience you might have when you go there.""

And now the project has received the ultimate seal of approval from Anderson himself. In the foreword to Koval's book, the director describes it as an ""alluring travel guide"" that ""should keep me busy for several decades.""

Anderson then signs off in typical style, writing: ""I now understand what it means to be accidentally myself. Thank you. I am still confused what it means to be deliberately me, if that is even what I am, but that is not important. I send my very best wishes and much gratitude to this group for discovering and sharing all these peculiar and fascinating vistas.""",
"The Pantheon: The ancient building still being used after 2,000 years","Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN Contributors Video: Ed Scott-Clarke, Tem Doran, Alex Sears, Angelica Pursley, CNN

When visitors walk into the Pantheon in Rome and encounter its colossal dome, they may experience the same theatricality as its guests nearly 2,000 years ago.

""Anyone who steps inside the Pantheon immediately feels the crushing weight of human history, but also the incredible lightness of human creativity,"" said John Ochsendorf, professor of architecture at MIT and former director of the American Academy in Rome.

""You come into this grand space and you look up and you see the sky or a passing cloud. And you think: 'How could they have done this nearly two millennia ago?'""

The Pantheon is the oldest building in the world that's still in use today. Since the 7th century, it has been a Roman Catholic church.

Built around 125 A.D. by the Roman emperor Publius Aelius Hadrianus, it was actually the third iteration of the structure. The first Pantheon caught fire around 80 A.D. and was rebuilt shortly after, but it was struck by lightning and burned down again around 110 A.D. The buildings' ill fate led to rumors that the Pantheon was cursed.

The facade of the completed structure riffed on ancient Greek motifs, with a portico entrance featuring a pediment -- a triangular top -- and two rows of Corinthian columns. The interior was sweeping and airy, capped by a dome that to this day -- is still the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world.

What was it used for?

Pantheon means ""all gods,"" and though it's commonly thought the structure was a site of worship dedicated to Roman deities, its original purpose is actually unknown.

With scant mentions of it in Ancient texts, historians have been left somewhat in the dark. Though it could be a temple, Roman buildings were typically multi-purpose structures, said Lynne Lancaster, an architectural historian and humanities educator. ""And so what actually went on in the Pantheon is hard to say.""

The Pantheon may have been used for a variety of purposes, but historians aren't quite sure what took place inside. Credit: Pino Pacifico/REDA&CO/Universal Images Group/Getty Images

Legends say it's the very site where Rome's founder, Romulus, ascended to heaven. Others believe the Pantheon was where the Roman emperor could communicate with the gods. Whatever the case, like many Roman architectural feats, the imposing structure was a show of might, an ""important symbol of imperial power,"" said Luca Mercuri, the Pantheon's current director.

Indeed, Roman architecture of the time embodied wealth, strength and dignity. Centuries later, Neoclassical architects would reference the Pantheon's portico and dome combination to imbue their buildings with those same values, from the US Capitol in Washington, DC., to the Somerset House in London.

How was it built?

The Pantheon was an architectural marvel of the Roman Empire.

The oculus -- Latin for ""eye"" -- stretches 30 feet across, opening the structure to the heavens. The sun beams through the oculus, and when it storms, the rain comes down like a waterfall into the interior.

The Pantheon's dome and oculus were a feat of engineering -- Medieval religious leaders believed the architectural achievement was evil. Credit: Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images

""The oculus at the center seemed to tempt fate and leave (the Pantheon) open to the sky,"" said Ochsendorf. ""But it also showed a mastery of geometry and construction -- that they could build domes on that scale and leave an oculus open at the center, in a way (that was) almost showing off.""

During the Middle Ages, religious leaders, who were incredulous of the feat, cast doubt on the holiness of the Pantheon, believing it to be the work of the devil.

But it wasn't Satan; it was engineering.

Though white, yellow, purple and black marble was imported from around the Mediterranean, it was concrete -- a Roman invention -- that allowed architects to do away with load-bearing columns and introduce spacious domes.

One trick to make a large dome stable was to use progressively lighter stone in the concrete mix as it reached the top. Heavy brick could be used at the base, with spongy, light volcanic rock around the oculus.

Though the Pantheon has revealed some of its design secrets, Lancaster said she still finds magic in the details. As the day progresses, the sun flickers around the dome's interior, casting light over its sunken grid like a giant sundial.

Remember when Jane Fonda revolutionized exercise in a leotard and leg warmers?,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Remember when Jane Fonda became the queen of 1980s at-home exercise?

Released in 1982, ""Jane Fonda's Workout"" is one of the bestselling VHS tapes of all time. Following on the heels of her New York Times bestseller of the previous year, ""Jane Fonda's Workout Book,"" the home video helped galvanize the actor's aerobics empire, which held strong throughout the '80s and into the '90s.

With VHS tapes, books, LPs and those long-forgotten videodiscs, Fonda showed us why we didn't need the gym to get fit, laying the groundwork for the hugely profitable home video industry at the time -- not to mention the explosion of the fitness industry today.

When Fonda released the video of herself in a striped leotard, black tights and burgundy stirrup leg warmers -- flanked by a crew of high-energy men and women whooping through repetitions of side stretches and leg lifts -- she was undergoing something of a reinvention.

""Jane Fonda's Workout"" wasn't just an exercise in transformation for the millions of viewers who bought her tapes, but for the model-turned award-winning actor turned activist, too.

""It was a pretty interesting time for me because people recognized me in a whole different way,"" Fonda recalled in the 2018 HBO documentary ""Jane Fonda In Five Acts.""

Political defiance

Fonda is no stranger to reinvention. Born to an actor father (Henry Fonda) and socialite mother, she rose to fame in the 1960s with a string of romcoms and as the spacey vixen of 1968 cult classic ""Barbarella,"" before diving into political activism in the US, notably as a thorn in the side of then President Richard Nixon.

Like many Americans, the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War had inspired Fonda to activism in the late 1960s, and her fundraising for the Black Panthers and antiwar campaign efforts eventually landed her under surveillance by the FBI, CIA and NSA.

In 1970, her now iconic mugshot, showing her with choppy hair and a defiant raised fist, captured the mood of the counterculture. Fonda had been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and for assaulting a customs officer while on her way into Cleveland after giving an anti-Vietnam War speech in Canada.

But Fonda's mugshot wasn't the only image of her to spread like wildfire. In 1972, she ignited outrage when she was photographed while touring North Vietnam, where she made a radio plea to US troops to reconsider the civilian cost of the war. Fonda has repeatedly apologized for the photo, which showed her on an anti-aircraft gun used to take down American planes. Media outlets ran with the biting nickname ""Hanoi Jane.""

""It was a very tumultuous and polarized time,"" she said in the HBO documentary. ""...I didn't always know how to channel my anger in constructive ways.""

'We knew we wanted to spread a message'

A decade later, in her aerobics videos, Fonda's message was aspirational and approachable -- anyone could change their body and their life -- and her outfit, leotard, leggings and, of course, leg warmers, became the workout uniform de rigueur for 1980s wellness. Now with soft curls and a bright encouraging smile, her workout series looked like a departure from the image of her as a radical revolutionary.

But Fonda's new endeavor as a relatable fitness instructor was still a political act. She filmed ""Jane Fonda's Workout"" in order to further her causes, with all the profits going to the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a political action committee (PAC) she co-founded with her husband at the time, Tom Hayden.

With her new PAC, Fonda had a more focused agenda. She and Hayden wanted to move ""power out of the super rich and the corporations into the hands of people -- the way it should be in a democracy,"" she said in the documentary. ""We knew we wanted to spread a message throughout the country.""

They decided to start a business to fund the work, first considering a restaurant or a carwash, she said. But Fonda had a background studying ballet, and the idea for her to capitalize on her knowledge of fitness just clicked. ""And then one day I suddenly thought: the workout. If It's one thing I understand it's working out.""

Her routine was meant to help women become stronger and healthier, but it wound up having that effect on her, too. She had been hiding an eating disorder before she became famous for her workout video, and Fonda credits the exercise with helping her build healthier habits, though she continued to struggle with her disorder, which she refers to as an addiction, for many years.

""The longer space you put between yourself and the addiction, the easier it gets,"" she told People in 2018. ""I started the workout, and that kind of cemented my ability to eat normal, which I can do now. Some people say you can never get over it, but you can.""

This February, Fonda will receive a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes. Outside of her acting work, her ongoing activism has also been in the spotlight. In 2019, she launched a series of climate action events called Fire Drill Fridays in Washington DC. There, she has led demonstrations -- and been arrested while doing so -- while wearing her recognizable bright red coat, which she has vowed is the last item of clothing she'll ever buy, in order to keep a more sustainable closet.

Fonda's fitness brand and her activism have always been connected through their purpose, but she has always remained ardent in their symmetry of spirit as well. Early in her career, she stated: ""Any healthy country, like any healthy individual, should be in perpetual revolution, perpetual change."" Through all of her reinventions, that belief has been a constant.",
"With Broadway still dark, actors find work 10,000 miles away in Sydney","Written by Will Ripley, CNN Sydney, Australia Contributors Angus Watson, CNN

Thousands of young actors, singers, dancers, and live performance artists flock to New York City every year, fueled by the dream of a starring role on Broadway, the world's biggest stage. And they hustle for it -- working odd jobs to make ends meet, sharing tiny apartments, huddling in long lines to audition for just a handful of highly coveted roles.

But the brilliant lights of Broadway have been dark for nearly a year. And its 41 theaters, including iconic century-old ones like the Belasco, Lyceum and New Amsterdam, will likely remain closed for many months, despite ongoing discussions about potential safety measures, like a cap on audience sizes or requiring attendees to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test.

The situation is dire for many of the 97,000 people who rely on Broadway for their livelihoods -- and for New York City, which benefits from the almost $15 billion generated by the industry each year, according to The Broadway League, a trade association representing producers and theater owners.

Beyond the economic impact, the price of countless crushed dreams is perhaps even greater, according to longtime Broadway performer Reed Kelly, whose stage credits include ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,"" ""The Addams Family,"" and ""Wicked.""

""I've lost three people this year to suicide,"" Kelly says. ""And that's on top of the people I know that have actually died from Covid. It's not just a job for us. This is our lives.""

Gabrielle McClinton, who was last seen on Broadway in the role of Annie in ""Chicago the Musical,"" echoes the heartbreak and hardship endured by many in New York's tightknit theater community.

""So many people have lost their jobs, and not just the actors, dancers, and singers (but also) the musicians, ushers and crew people. I know all my friends have been struggling, but they've been making it work by creating their own projects and kind of pivoting in different directions -- moving more into the TV and film realms,"" McClinton says.

Reed's and McClinton's dedication to their craft has taken them to the other side of the world -- literally. Nearly ten thousand miles from Broadway, in Sydney, Australia, live theater is thriving. The city is one of the few places in the world where performances are open to the public.

'Making it work'

In December, Kelly and Australian acrobat Jack Dawson, who form the aerial straps duo Two Fathoms, debuted ""Kismet,"" a four-minute act performed in front of a live audience at the Sydney Trapeze School and then released as an online film

""Right now, this is really the only place that both of us can be -- and do what we do,"" Kelly says from the school, where he also practices.

What they do takes hours of daily practice and, for Kelly in particular, deep personal sacrifice. He and his husband Balmeet, a doctor in Los Angeles, have been apart for almost a year. But if Kelly leaves Australia, he won't be allowed to return, given that the country has banned entry to all non-residents since March of last year.

""I'm away from my family. I'm not at home. I don't get to see my husband. We FaceTime everyday. But it's been such a challenge.""

McClinton just returned to the US after spending several months in Australia playing a leading role in the musical ""Pippin,"" which enjoyed a two-month run at Sydney's Lyric Theatre.

She says the success of live performances in Australia ""absolutely"" gives her hope about Broadway.

""It definitely had its challenges, but we got through the season. People came to the show wearing their masks and we would get Covid-19 tested every week. When we (weren't) on stage, we were in our masks and everybody obeyed all the rules and we did our due diligence. And when we were outside the theater we made sure we weren't putting other people at risk,"" she says.

""(In Australia) people are making it work. I know it can work, because we did it. I think if everybody complies, we can make it happen (on Broadway).""

A model for Broadway

Australian playwright Tom Wright says Sydney should offer a model for how to reopen Broadway and the world's other theater districts. Wright serves as Artistic Associate for the renowned Belvoir St Theatre, which in September became one of the first theaters in Australia to reopen after authorities shuttered venues around the country.

Parts of Australia endured some of the world's harshest Covid-19 lockdowns at the height of the pandemic last year. But the tough measures -- including the imposition of curfews and strict curbs on social gatherings -- appear to have paid off, with local cases virtually eliminated.

""The reason why Sydney has been able to reopen is because people at local, state and federal levels took seriously the safety of the most vulnerable people in society. And we're a reflection of that,"" Wright says, adding: ""You need political and social leadership to provide a safe set of circumstances for theater to reopen.""

Adhering to local government guidelines, the Belvoir imposes a 75% audience cap and requires visitors to wear masks and register via a QR code at the venue's foyer.

Sydney's revival of live theater in the midst of a global pandemic gives hope to performers around the world -- especially back in New York, where many of Kelly's friends are happy -- albeit a bit envious, he admits -- that he's working.

""Shows are opening, people are getting the chance to perform, and my greatest wish is to just encourage everyone. Look, I'm an American. I'm over here (in Australia) and they're nailing it. So, try and get on board, even if it's not the most comfortable thing. In the long run, it's the best thing.""",

Whimsical prairie dresses or animal-prints with burlesque flair? Red carpet glamour or potato-sack couture? For the Autumn-Winter 2021 season, Moschino creative director Jeremy Scott decided that one motif wasn't enough, so he designed a collection with five instead.

Debuting during Milan Fashion Week in a film called ""Jungle Red,"" the styles are unveiled in a gilded theater with a rotating set, featuring a cast of characters including Dita von Teese, Stella Maxwell, Precious Lee, Winnie Harlow, Hailey Bieber and Soo Joo Park. Maye Musk, mother of tech billionaire Elon Musk, is the show's presenter.

Riffing off the famous theater scene in George Cukor's 1939 film ""The Women,"" where an all-woman cast -- played by the likes of Joan Crawford and Joan Fontaine -- attend a live show to see the latest fashion styles on stage, Scott's inspiration is an imagined 20th-century cosmopolitan woman, presented with an updated sensibility. A notable difference is the much more diverse group of women to Cukor's all-White ensemble, and Scott has also included models of different sizes and ages.

""There's not just one archetype of age or beauty,"" American-born Scott said of his film's cast. ""There's many different races; there's different body types. So in essence, that is much more true to life, but not true to film or true to the kind of archetypes that Hollywood would perpetuate, especially in the 1930s.""

In the Moschino fashion film, the models shift from weekday work to weekend leisure, with visits to art museums, the theater, and the countryside. The film takes its name from a coveted nail polish hue in Cukor's film.

""I love this kind of nostalgic presentation,"" said Scott in a video interview for CNN Style. Due to the limitations of Fashion Week during the global health crisis, the film is the second unconventional showing for the Italian label since last year. For its Spring-Summer 2021 collection, Scott sent marionettes wearing tiny Moschino looks down a runway set, with doppelgangers of famous fashion faces in the crowd.

""I've been very fortunate to be able to find another way of expressing myself outside of the traditional fashion show with having everyone gather together, which is not possible this time,"" said Scott.

'A little joy and levity'

""Jungle Red"" mixes camp and glamour, with models walking the stage during each vignette.

There's plenty of signature Moschino kitsch, with one model wearing a statuesque windmill atop her chignon hair coil, while others walk out in bell-sleeved potato sacks and oversized hair bows (reminiscent of the Marilyn Monroe shoot in which she proved that she could look good wearing nothing but burlap).

The first business looks of slicked hair, tiny pinstriped hats and tailored suits among a New York City set give way to a pastoral scene featuring bubble-sleeve prairie dresses printed with fluffy clouds, grassy fields and cows.

Meanwhile spectators at a museum wear wide-brimmed hats and flared pencil skirts as the paintings come alive with models in brushstroke-printed gowns. During the urban safari, replete with faux-plant jungle, models prowl around in animal-inspired outfits, including a long-tailed gold alligator two-piece skirt suit, and a black one-shoulder mini-dress with a glitzy embellished flamingo. Finally, at the theater the models swan about in red-carpet gowns and capes with chunky jewelry and stacks of pearls, as well as one dramatic shawl in the shape of oversized black evening gloves.

Like many industries, the pandemic has upended the norms of the fashion world, and Scott hopes that Moschino's irreverent shows provide some much-needed joy.

""The most important thing I always want to communicate with my collections and my work and my shows is really bringing some humor and ... a little joy and levity,"" he said. ""I think that that's the most important thing I can do in my work.""",
This woman left North Korea 70 years ago. Now virtual reality has helped her return,"Hyun Mi was 13 years old when she fled Pyongyang with her parents and five siblings to escape fighting on the Korean Peninsula. Chinese troops were approaching the North Korean capital and her family planned to hide further south until they passed.

""I thought it would be a week, but that week became 70 years,"" said Hyun, now 83.

But now, for the first time since the family fled, Hyun has been able to visit her childhood home -- or at least a version of it -- using virtual reality technology.

In the absence of real-life family reunions, the South Korean government is hoping a new virtual reality project will provide some comfort to aging North Korean refugees who fear that time is running out.

Fleeing North Korea

Thousands of people like Hyun fled North Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s, across the border into China and Russia. Many ended up in South Korea.

Hyun said many North Korean women stayed behind to guard their houses while men and their children fled, afraid that they would be killed by Chinese soldiers, who were considered less likely to kill a woman.

Her family left her two younger sisters, aged 6 and 9, in the care of their grandmother.

They planned to come back when the fighting eased, but after war ended with an armistice in 1953, North and South Korea erected an almost impenetrable border between the countries, preventing anyone from crossing either side.

Many families like Hyun's became separated from the places they knew and the people they loved.

In the decades since, North Korea has become increasingly isolated from the world, led by a dynasty of dictators that wants the reunification of the Koreas but under its own terms.

While the two countries have allowed select families to reunite for brief and emotional meetings, most families that were separated during the war have never been able to see their loved ones.

Meetings are conducted by a lottery system based on age and the strength of family ties. Reunions have been canceled in the past when relations between the two countries have deteriorated. The last meetings took place in 2018, when 89 families from South Korea were able to meet with their North Korean relatives. Many who took part were in their 90s.

Reminders of the past

The anguish of separated families prompted South Korea's Ministry of Unification to ask the country's Red Cross to create a project to connect them with their hometowns.

The Red Cross worked with Ahn Hyo-jin, the chief executive of Seoul-based VR company Tekton Space, to create VR experiences for North Korean refugees.

""There are many displaced people in Korea and all of them are longing to visit their hometown but cannot due to the circumstances,"" Ahn said.

Hyun -- a well-known singer in South Korea whose hits include a 1960s song about being separated from loved ones -- was the first North Korean refugee to take a virtual tour of her homeland.

It wasn't easy to recreate places in reclusive North Korea, Ahn said.

His company interviewed Hyun, asking her to recall vivid moments from her childhood. As she spoke, a designer sketched what she described, checking periodically to see if the drawing matched her memories. Those sketches were then turned into 3D designs.

""It was very daunting when we began,"" said 3D designer Moun Jong-sik. ""What if the thing that I made does not resemble her memories?""

But when Hyun put on the VR headset in September this year, she found she couldn't stop crying.

""I made it to North Korea!"" Hyun exclaimed.

The recreation of Pyongyang wasn't exactly the same as she remembered, she said, but it was close. As Hyun surveyed a snow-covered recreation of the house where she grew up, she said she kept thinking about her parents, now long dead.

""The faces of my mother, father, sisters and brothers flashed before me,"" she said.

Hyun remembered how crowded their house was with eight siblings around the dinner table, and sneaking into her dad's store to eat squid without him knowing. She saw a seafood market in Pyongyang where she used to play jump rope, and Taedong River, where she used to swim as a child.

Hyun still lives with the pain of leaving behind two of her sisters. She briefly united with one of them in China 20 years ago, a meeting made possible by a broker with business ties in North Korea. Their meeting was filmed by a documentary crew and later televised. Her sister was just 6 years old when she left, and would live a much tougher life.

""If only I came with you, I could have been a star singer just like you,"" Hyun recalled her sister saying at the reunion.

""She was almost 60 but she still looked the same. I saw how she lost all her hair, all her teeth and toenails, too,"" Hyun added.

In the 1990s -- around the time Hyun met with her sister -- North Korea was hit by a famine that led to an estimated 600,000 deaths, though earlier estimates put the figure much higher.

""Even today when I go to a buffet restaurant, I cry, because there is such an abundance of food,"" she said. ""It pains me greatly to see any food thrown out because it makes me think of my sisters in the North.""

Future plans for refugees

Although there is no official count on the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea, South Korea's Ministry of Unification said in its latest statistics released last month that, since 1988, 133,000 people have officially registered to meet their family in the north. But the chances of those reunions are dwindling as the refugees grow old. As of November, there are 49,700 refugees of those registered still alive in South Korea.

Ahn hopes Hyun's experience is only the start.

The country's unification ministry has shown interest in expanding the project next year to model other regions where refugees have previously lived, says Ahn. A ministry official said it is currently considering a plan, although they have no timeline yet. But, creating bespoke projects for every refugee will not be possible, he added.

Ahn's company has interviewed a number of displaced people who, like Hyun, wish they could visit their hometown. They also wish to see their family, but the VR technology can't help with that -- the experience doesn't include people.

Hyun said while the virtual reality project gave her some comfort, what she really wants is the freedom to see her family members in real life.

""I don't want a lot -- I don't even want unification. I'd just appreciate if we can visit each other,"" she said.",
"Empowering, alluring, degenerate? The evolution of red lipstick","Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here.

In 1912 thousands of supporters of the suffrage movement marched past the New York salon of Elizabeth Arden. The cosmetics brand founder, who had just opened her business two years earlier, was a supporter of women's rights, and she aligned herself with the cause by handing out tubes of bright red lipstick to the marching women.

Suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Charlotte Perkins Gilman loved red lipstick for its ability to shock men, and protesters donned the bold color en masse, adopting it as a sign of rebellion and liberation.

""There could not be a more perfect symbol of suffragettes than red lipstick, because it's not just powerful, it's female,"" said Rachel Felder, author of last year's ""Red Lipstick: An Ode to a Beauty Icon,"" in a phone interview. ""Suffragettes were about female strength, not just strength.""

Throughout the centuries red lipstick has signaled many things, from its early use by the elite in ancient Egypt and by prostitutes in ancient Greece, to its status in early Hollywood as a symbol of glamor. In its many hues, this color on lips has been a mighty cultural weapon, charged with thousands of centuries of meaning. ""Red lipstick is truly a way to trace cultural history and societal zeitgeist,"" Felder said.

Until lipstick was popularized in the early 20th century, red lips were often associated with morally dubious women: impolite, sexually amoral, even heretical. In the Dark Ages, red lips were seen as a sign of commingling with the devil. The makeup ""was associated with this mysterious, frightening femininity,"" Felder said.

Then, Felder's book explains, as the American suffrage movement adopted red lips, their international counterparts did, too.

As women's rights movements spread across Europe, New Zealand and Australia, with British and American organizers often sharing tactics, from organizing marches, to hunger strikes, to more aggressive militant strategies. And this solidarity extended to their makeup. Inspired by her American counterparts, British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst favored a red lip, which helped spread the symbolic gesture among her fellow activists.

Though suffragettes popularized the red-lip look in their day, Felder notes that there was already momentum to normalize lipstick among women more generally, as they dropped restrictive corsets for brassieres, and started to adopt more streamlined silhouettes, designed by the likes of Coco Chanel.

After the suffragettes wore red lipstick, the exuberant flappers of the Roaring Twenties followed suit. And while suffragettes may not have been solely responsible for popularizing a painted lip, they embodied the idea of the ""modern woman"" in Europe and America, Felder pointed out.

During World War II, red lips had their bold second act of defiance. Adolf Hitler ""famously hated red lipstick,"" Felder said. In Allied countries, wearing it became a sign of patriotism and a statement against facism. When taxes made lipstick prohibitively expensive in the UK, women stained their lips with beet juice instead.

As men went off to war and women filled their professional roles back home, they donned red lips to enter the workforce. It showed their resilience in the face of conflict, Felder explained, and offered a sense of normalcy in difficult times. ""It allowed women to retain a sense of their own self-identity from before the war."" J. Howard Miller's illustration of Rosie the Riveter, the cultural icon who was used to recruit and empower American female factory workers, notably had cherry-daubed lips.

In 1941 and for the duration of the war, red lipstick became mandatory for women who joined the US Army. Beauty brands had capitalized on the wartime trend, with Elizabeth Arden releasing ""Victory Red"" and Helena Rubenstein introducing ""Regimental Red,"" among others. But it was Arden who the American government asked to create a regulation lip and nail color for serving women. Her ""Montezuma Red"" matched and accentuated their uniforms' red piping.

""Wearing red lipstick for a woman in that era was so linked to... a sense of feminine self-esteem,"" particularly, ""resilient and strong female self-esteem,"" said Felder, who has herself worn the beauty staple nearly every day since high school. After the war, classic Hollywood actresses like Elizabeth Taylor added a layer of glamour to the confident look.

Today, other protest symbols for women's empowerment have become widespread, notably the pink pussy hat that dominated the 2017 Women's March; and the habit from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" which has been worn internationally for women's causes, including pro-choice demonstrations.

Yet red lips still pack a punch. In a viral image from 2015, a Macedonian woman kissed an officer's riot shield during an anti-government protest, leaving a red kiss mark in a poignant moment of rebellion.

In 2018 in Nicaragua, women and men wore red lipstick and uploaded photos of themselves to social media to show their support for the release of anti-government protesters. They were reacting to activist Marlén Chow, who defied her interrogators by applying red lipstick.

Last December, nearly 10,000 women in Chile took to the streets wearing black blindfolds, red scarves, and red lips to denounce sexual violence in the country.

By wearing red lips, protesters all over the world have tapped into the same power the suffrage movement once plumbed a century earlier. In this bold, defiant beauty statement, their legacy lives on.

'Straight Outta Ulaanbaatar': A portrait of Mongolia's burgeoning hip-hop scene,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

It was 1996 when the young poet Tugsjargal Munkherdene heard American hip-hop for the first time.

Four years earlier, Mongolia's Soviet-aligned government had fallen, opening the country to a fresh wave of cultural imports. The easing of state censorship heralded a new era of free expression. It also meant that G-funk, boom bap and gangster rap soon arrived on the airwaves -- including the track that made a lasting impression on the then-teenage Munkherdene: Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's ""187 On an Undercover Cop.""

""I realized I could put my poems on a beat like them, and I started writing rap music,"" he recalled in a video interview from his studio in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital.

Growing up in one of Ulaanbaatar's impoverished ger districts, Munkherdene could empathize with the kind of urban hardship chronicled in the music he idolized. Comprised largely of semi-permanent tents (or gers, the Mongolian word for yurts), these sprawling outer-city settlements have tripled in size since 1990, as a traditionally nomadic population is lured to the capital.

Most of the districts' low-income households rely on wood-burning stoves -- or until a ban in 2019 , coal-burning ones -- sending pollution across the skies of a city where winter temperatures regularly fall below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. As a child, Munkherdene would walk several kilometers a day to fetch water.

""We didn't have recording studio -- there were very few and (they were) very expensive. The start of my rap career was very hard,"" he said. ""We didn't have a way to make good money, to make high-quality audio and video, or to work with big companies. Television and radio stations blocked our music and videos. They thought hip-hop was a bad thing.""

Now, more than two decades later, the 37-year-old, known professionally as Big Gee, is one of the country's best-known MCs. A regular fixture on Mongolian television, and even the star of a KFC ad , he is the heavily tattooed, sports car-driving epitome of the rags-to-riches hip-hop tale.

But he and Mongolia's rap community are little-known outside the landlocked country. This is, in part, what prompted British photographer and director Alex de Mora to capture some of the scene's colorful characters in ""Straight Outta Ulaanbaatar,"" a documentary and book that profile a selection of the city's crews and artists, as well B-boys, a record store owner and a tattooist.

""When most people think about Mongolia, they think about big open expanses, and maybe they've heard of a two-humped camel or have seen people riding around on horses ... but they've never thought about contemporary culture in an urban environment,"" De Mora said on a video call from London. ""That's what I wanted to show -- that across the world there are different things going on where cultures are crossing over.""

Tackling social issues

Describing himself as ""obsessed with music and subcultures,"" De Mora has previously photographed high-profile US rappers like Pusha T, MF Doom and members of the Wu-Tang Clan. He often eschews the cliched tropes of hip-hop photography, an approach maintained during his self-funded trip to Mongolia. While some of the portraits show local rappers flaunting their jewelry or posing in -- or on top of -- their cars, many are warmer and more playful than the genre usually dictates.

""I try and avoid the obvious bravado-type portraits,"" he said. ""It's quite funny when you get your camera out and a guy starts posing, which is good to have some of. But with this project I wanted to find more intimate and personal moments.""

Big Gee, whose image features on the cover of De Mora's book, also serves as the documentary's central figure and narrator. The issues he addresses tell a wider story about the challenges of life in Ulaanbaatar.

""In Mongolia we have lots of problems -- social issues, unemployment, alcoholism corruption and many more,"" Munkherdene told CNN, adding: ""The government isn't taking care of the Mongolian people, they're just taking care of themselves .""

The rapper is known for speaking out about corruption and abuses of power. But if these themes are common to hip-hop around the world, then many of the other topics he raps about are specific to his homeland: struggles in the ger district and the pride of his Mongolian ancestry (Munkherdene has the word ""Mongol"" tattooed in traditional script beneath his left eye). He has also used his lyrics to rally against Chinese-operated mines for their alleged mistreatment of local workers -- controversially so, due to his use of a derogatory racial slur (his manager told CNN that the rapper had not used the word in reference to Chinese people, though the music video in question has nonetheless been deleted from YouTube).

And, like many Mongolian folk songs, there's another important theme woven through his music: nature.

""I've done some songs about protecting nature, (and I have one called) 'Leave My Country to Us.' What's the real richness? Money? Gold? In my opinion, it's not money not gold, not bling-bling things, not big chains or big cars. Real richness is human beings and pure nature.""

Portrait of a city

Fittingly, nature is also a central character in De Mora's photos. Mountains, sand dunes and -- on unpolluted days -- rich blue skies are never far away in Ulaanbaatar. One shot sees Big Gee holding an eagle and sitting proudly on the back of a Bactrian camel; others replace the urban backdrops typical of hip-hop photography with the vast, empty landscapes found at the city's outskirts.

""They call (Mongolia) the 'Land of the Blue Sky' for very good reason,"" De Mora said. ""It's something that makes the photographs themselves very vivid. I've never seen so much sun and blue sky in my life.""

Though De Mora's project assumes the perspective of a particular subculture, it is, in truth, a broad portrait of the Mongolian capital. His photos paint a wider picture of the city's diverse residents, complete with kids playing in the streets and an elderly accordion player.

In the documentary, meanwhile, footage of rappers is interspersed with shots of Soviet-style murals, identikit tower blocks, public statues and smokestacks. The combination of English graffiti and Cyrillic signs hint at the varying cultural forces at work in the city.

Aside from a song by the young Mongolian rapper Maberrant, played during the closing credits, the soundtrack looks to folk instruments, wind chimes and eerie natural sounds rather than hip-hop.

""I didn't want people to watch the film and judge the people by the music,"" said De Mora. ""I wanted them to watch the film and understand the city and the personality of the people and the place ... It was always a portrait of a city, and a culture within a city. It was never going to be a critique or a review of the music.""",

"With tradition and new tech, these Japanese designers are crafting more sustainably made clothing","Written by Lena Vazifdar, CNN

In Japan, the term ""mottainai"" -- loosely translated to ""what a waste"" -- has deep roots. Originating from a Buddhist belief that every object has intrinsic value and should be utilized for its full life cycle, the credo has been threaded throughout national culture for centuries.

""Mottainai and handmade culture is everywhere in Japan,"" said Kaoru Imajo, director of Japan Fashion Week Organization, said in an email. Sake lees (the residual yeast left over from the fermentation process), he points out, has long been used as a cooking ingredient, and discarded orange peels have been reduced to fibers and turned into paper. Brands like Nisai , in their Autumn-Winter 2021 collection shown at Tokyo's Rakuten Fashion Week (pictured above), upcycle used clothing to design ""one-of-a-kind"" looks. Then there's the case of boro textiles -- fabrics that are often worn out, but then repurposed, patched together to create new garments.

""We have been fixing old carpets, clothes and fabric so we can use (them) as long as we could,"" he said. ""Now, boro textiles are traded very expensively and known as a 'Japanese vintage fabric.'""

Today, a number of Japanese fashion labels are channeling these traditional ideas in the name of sustainability, embracing centuries-old garment production techniques and pioneering new technology to reduce waste and lessen environmental harm throughout the production process.

Innovation from nature

At Shohei, founded by creative director Lisa Pek and CFO Shohei Yamamoto in 2016, sustainable decision-making starts with the dyeing process. Pek says the brand, which operates out of Japan and Austria, has been working with a Kyoto-based artisan to procure textiles dyed using traditional kakishibu methods.

During the kakishibu dyeing process, textiles are immersed in the fermented juice of unripe persimmon fruit -- an alternative to popular synthetic dyes, which can be damaging to soil and waterways. After the dyeing process, the fabric is tanned in the sun, creating orange hues. The kakishibu dyeing process also creates a water-resistant effect when oxidized in the air, and provides antibacterial properties. ""This is something you might find in a tech fabric,"" Pek explained in a video call, ""but it's already there in nature.""

Shohei also sources fabric dyed using shibori -- a hand-dyeing technique that dates back to the eighth century -- from a family-run business in Nagoya. Like kakishibu, shibori uses natural dyes (typically derived from indigo) and is less harmful to the environment than its synthetic counterparts.

In a similar spirit of eco-friendly production, Japanese designer Hiroaki Tanaka, founder of Studio Membrane, has been working with biodegradable protein resins derived from wool -- the basis for ""The Claws of Clothes,"" a collection of avant garde, architectural womenswear unveiled at the 2018 Eco Fashion Week Australia in Perth. Created in collaboration with Shinji Hirai, a professor at the department of sciences and informatics at Hokkaido's Muroran Institute of Technology, Tanaka likens the protein resin's texture to a human fingernail, and its durable texture to plastic.

""I wanted to make totally biodegradable clothes,"" Tanaka said over Zoom, through a translator. ""Because it's just made of wool, it's very (ecologically friendly).""

However, Tanaka admits that his protein resin is better suited to wearable art than everyday clothing. When the resin is wet it reverts to its usual wool form, and loses its structure. However, since wool is biodegradable, he believes the material could be used to replace certain disposable items, such as diapers, that are currently filling landfills.

Using tech to combat waste

As fabric choices are integral to sustainable fashion, new technology and machinery is also at the forefront of this environmental movement, decreasing the amount of fabric wasted during pattern-making, sampling and sewing.

In this arena, Japanese manufacturer Shima Seiki has set the standard with its computerized Wholegarment knitting machines. Unlike the traditional way of producing knitwear, where individual pieces are knitted then sewn together, Wholegarment items are seamlessly knitted in their entirety in a singular piece.

According to Masaki Karasuno, a Shima Seiki spokesperson, up to 30% of fabric is wasted in standard production, when individual pieces of pattern are cut from bolts of fabric before being sewn together. ""All of that is eliminated when an entire garment can be knitted in one piece directly off the machine,"" he said in a phone interview.

Wholegarment's machinery gives brands the option to produce clothing on demand -- another way to reduce industry waste. ""Mass producing garments based on projected demand tends to overshoot actual demand (and is the reason) why there's a lot of overstock... which results in waste,"" Karasuno explained. ""Wholegarment can produce the number of garments that are required, when they are required.""

In 2016, Fast Retailing Co., the parent company to fast fashion giant Uniqlo, started a strategic partnership with Shima Seiki called Innovation Factory, where they produce a variety of Wholegarment knits for the Uniqlo brand. Since then, Italian fashion label Max Mara and American clothing brand Paul Stuart have also turned to Shima Seiki's Wholegarment technology.

Shima Seiki also offers a virtual sampling platform which provides realistic renderings of individual garments -- alternatives to the physical samples that are produced as a collection is developed. Often, sampling is an iterative process, with factories sending new, tweaked versions of a garment until the designer is content with the final product. While the process is helpful for designers, allowing them to adjust for factors like fit, placement and quality, these prototypes often end up landfills.

""Each of those samples that gets wasted requires time, cost, material and energy to produce ... and all of those are just thrown away,"" Karasuno said.

Shohei has been partnering with No Form, a digital design studio, to produce realistic 3D images of some of their garments using tech similar to Shima Seiki's virtual sampling platform. These renderings can be used in their online store in place of photos of samples. ""It's the same as when you think about architecture, where you create a model... before building it,"" Pek said. ""It's also another way to be environmentally friendly and save costs.""

Christina Dean , the founder and board chair of Redress, an environmental charity that aims to reduce textile waste, believes the steps taken by Japan's fashion industry is setting a positive example for a healthier fashion ecosystem internationally.

""I think it's very interesting how islands deal with innovation. If you have a country that can't have endless landfills, and you can't ship all your waste and dump it somewhere else... it drives innovation,"" she said in a phone interview.

""When you go to Japan it's a beautiful, considered, minimalist, cultured society, and if you couple their traditional past with the fact that they are very high tech, the textile industry in Japan is a champion in terms of technology.""",
'Nomadland': Chloé Zhao and crew reveal how they made one of the year's best films,"Thomas Page , CNN Written by

Having been wrenched from the earth, the mineral gypsum is crushed first. It's then blasted at high temperatures and ground down, packed up and shipped out to find a new purpose. What's left behind is a void; an empty space where something once thought permanent used to be.

Such was the fate of Empire, a mining town near the Black Rock Desert, Nevada. When the gypsum mine closed in 2011 under the weight of the recession, it extinguished the community and scattered its people. Not even the zip code survived.

Out of this event the character of Fern was born, the lynchpin of Chloé Zhao's Oscar-frontrunner ""Nomadland."" Played by Frances McDormand, Fern is a widow who leaves Empire to become a nomad and travel the American West. Amid its vast landscapes she finds a new purpose with people brought together by happenstance and bonded by the road.

Fern is a fiction, but the world she inhabits is not. The itinerant lifestyle of a subsection of the baby boomer generation is becoming well-documented -- through Jessica Bruder's 2017 non-fiction book ""Nomadland: Surviving America in the 21st Century,"" from which ""Nomadland"" was adapted, but also Zhao's film.

The director's novel approach, enlisting two-time Oscar winner McDormand to act as a friend and confidant to real life nomads playing themselves, has become one of the film's most beguiling features, if not its defining one. These interactions, like everything in ""Nomadland,"" appear effortless. But the film's grace was hard won; the product of a dedicated crew who found poetry out west and presented it to audiences with rare clarity.

Winner of a slew of awards, the film has been nominated for six Academy Awards: best director, best adapted screenplay and best editing for Zhao, best actress for McDormand, best cinematography for Joshua James Richards, and best picture. But how ""Nomadland"" was made is every bit as noteworthy as the film itself.

CNN spoke to Zhao, her cast and her crew, and asked them to recall the long journey to screen. The following interviews have been edited for length and clarity.

The story begins in 2017 when McDormand and producing partner Peter Spears optioned the rights to Bruder's book. In 2018 McDormand pitched the film and the directing job to Zhao, whose second feature ""The Rider"" had impressed the actor.

Joshua James Richards, cinematographer/production designer: Chloé had been looking at alternative ways of living on the road for years, so there was an element of serendipity when Frances McDormand came with this project.

I read the book the same time as Chloé (Richards is Zhao's partner as well as regular cinematographer) and there were some early discussions about the potential for narrative -- because it was unusual to take a documentary book and turn it into narrative. But we immediately saw this middle ground and that excited us.

Zhao spent time with the film's two professional actors, McDormand and David Strathairn, developing their characters, but she also needed to cast the nomads. She and Richards embarked on a road trip in their campervan ""Akira"" to connect with the community, including Swankie and Linda May, who featured in Bruder's book and would go on to star in the film.

Linda May, actor/nomad: Chloé came to visit me in Douglas, Arizona. I happened to have several van-dwelling RV ladies in my neighborhood at the time, and Chloé asked if we could all get together. We just told her stories all day.

Swankie, actor/nomad: They caught up with me in Colorado. I thought it was neat that they actually had a camper van and they were building it out. That sort of surprised me. They cared about the lifestyle.

Chloé Zhao, writer/director: The trip gave me time to let go of all these worries about production and just experience the landscape and meet people and not feel like I had to commit to anything.

Richards: It was kind of an on-the-road screen test. The most important thing was familiarizing ourselves with the nomads and getting a sense of how they're going to be in front of camera.

Swankie: Chloé doesn't take no for an answer. It took her two days to talk me into it. I had this surgery coming up and I didn't know if I would still be in a sling when they started shooting. She said, 'we'll work around it,' and I went, 'wow, they really must want me.'

Richards: Swankie's monologue (one the film's highlights in which she describes a moment of bliss in the wild) came from the first time we met her. Chloé was like, 'please remember that.'

Those trips are not just important, they're the magic trick. Because the audience arrives once all these relationships have been formed, but all the work is done really in prep.

Zhao: Every project I've done, there is this moment in prep which is my own dark night of the soul. I go, 'Do I have a movie?' You've gathered so much and it's all in your head and it hasn't worked yet. That trip really made me realize that it could.

Beginning in South Dakota in September 2018, the 36-strong crew traveled through Nebraska, Nevada, California and Arizona over six months, picking up scenes as they went. McDormand is in nearly every shot, delivering a flinty, unfussy performance typical of the actor.

Zhao: She's one of the legends.

Richards: She is a force of nature.

Swankie: I'd never heard of Frances McDormand before. But somebody pointed her out and I thought I should introduce myself. I tapped her on the shoulder and started to say, 'hi I'm ...' and she turned around and squealed 'Swankie!' She started talking to me excitedly about all the plans and the scenes. It was like working alongside an equal.

Richards: It was tough on Fran, because the nomads come in and Chloé would have to work with them quite carefully. And then Fran gets five minutes and just kills it. You feel bad, because we'd leave a scene and everyone's just 'Swankie! God, Swankie!' Then, 'well done, Fran. Anyway, next scene.'

Chloé Zhao and Frances McDormand take a moment on the set of ""Nomadland."" ""I wish I'd had a little bit more time to learn from Fran,"" says Zhao. ""I think in this film she sort of stepped out of her world into mine. I imagine if I were in a situation where there were rehearsals, I would be able to learn so much from her."" Credit: Joshua James Richards/Searchlight Pictures

Linda May: The crew was so enthusiastic. I eventually learned they had morning meetings and would go through what the shoot was going to be that day, so Frances knew what they were trying to capture. I wasn't included in those roundtable meetings -- all for the better.

Zhao: With non-professional actors, I do not like to rehearse them. With these wide-angle lenses close to people, the lens is very sensitive to things that are not authentic. So even though the first take might not be usable, sometimes there might be something there that cannot be repeated. And I would really hate myself if that wasn't on camera.

Swankie: Oh my god that camera was so big, and he got so close to my face. You forget the camera after a while -- until you see the movie on IMAX and realize your wrinkles have been multiplied 50 times.

Richards: (No-rehearsal) impacts everything. Gone are the big lighting rigs. You're allowing as much freedom as possible.

You have me, Wolf (Snyder, production sound recordist) and Chloé all moving as one. If (image, sound and performance) aren't all working, then there's no point. Chloé would even look to Wolf sometimes about performance -- close your eyes and you can hear a bad performance almost better than you can see it.

Linda May: Chloé would just say, 'tell me this story,' or, 'we're gonna have this conversation.' I just got to be myself. Almost everything was done in one take.

The result is documentary-style testimony within a narrative framework. Perhaps the most powerful account is that delivered by Linda May, who describes contemplating suicide in 2008.

Linda May: I wouldn't say (I was) happy to share my lowest point, but it was honest. I think sometimes our greatest defeat can turn into our biggest strength. To be able to share that with someone who may be considering 'this is the end of the road for me, there's nowhere else to go' -- that if you just take one more step, magic and miracles can happen. To put my life on screen like that, another human being can see, 'wow, one day she was going to kill herself and today she's a movie star because she didn't.'

Richards: It doesn't get any more collaborative and inclusive than the experience of ""Nomadland."" I mean, Derek ...

Derek Endres was found through street casting; a young man who had been hopping trains and living on the road for four years, says Richards. Zhao says his scene best illustrates her approach to filmmaking.

Zhao: The scene with Fern and Derek is very special to me. I like to make films where there's something about it that's slightly off what the rest of the film is about. Fern is reciting a Shakespeare sonnet with a little young drifter -- it seems like it has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but it somehow does fit. When the world throws interesting things at you, catch them.

Richards: We just loved this guy and he started staying at the hotel with us. We said, 'Derek, do you want to be part of the crew?' Derek became part of the art department and worked on the movie for a good few months and became part of it.

It's almost like community theatre, what Chloé is going for. (There have been) questions, 'why isn't it just a documentary?' Why would a documentary be more true than what ""Nomadland"" is?

Zhao: I think we need both facts and fiction. Since the dawn of civilization, we've had poetry, fiction, allegories and myths to help us make sense (of the world) in a safe place.

I don't have the guts to make documentaries. I think it's incredibly brave to connect with people and be able to say, 'this is what you're giving me: yourself.' I don't really know if I could form that kind of relationship. Sometimes, I find the best way to convey truth is through poetry.

""They are in the twilight of their years, these characters,"" says Richards. ""They're very aware that they have fewer years ahead of them than behind Credit: Courtesy of Searchlight Pictures

Zhao edited the film with an international crew, beginning post-production in 2020.

Richards: Post(-production) was fascinating, in that maintaining naturalism is really difficult to do sometimes. Chloé wanted to be true to the colors that are there and not put anything between the audience. There's no feeling of the digital intermediate (image manipulation processes including color enhancement) whatsoever.

It was interesting with ""Nomadland,"" because the experience of the film was just nowhere near complete until sound was done.

Zach Seivers, re-recording mixer/supervising sound editor: Chloé's insistence that the production sound captures the environment exactly as it is -- meaning there's no crowd control, no locking down of sets -- really makes for a magical sounding production track.

Sergio Diaz, sound designer/supervising sound editor: For me, the sound was another character. I wasn't familiar with the sonic richness of the American West. I was very meticulous selecting the most accurate and atmospheric layers to contribute to the story and make it more powerful, emotionally.

Richards: Chloé and I have been really lucky to be able to collaborate with people who believe in the same kind of things we do. I discovered on ""Nomadland"" how I want to make movies. Until this film, I wasn't sure. Now I feel like I know.

""Nomadland"" premiered at the Venice Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival on September 11, 2020, winning top prizes at both. It has been garlanded with awards ever since, and lauded by critics. But some opinions matter more than others.

Swankie: The first time I saw it there were seven other women there that I knew. When my scene came on, that close up, I couldn't watch it. I honest to god just sat there with my fingers in my ears and my eyes covered up.

I had to go back the next day with nobody with me. That was the first time I actually got it -- I could understand the movie from the public's point of view, I think, because I cried. That was pretty amazing. It's hard to get gracious enough to watch yourself, especially when you think you're making a fool of yourself.

Linda May: I know some people say, 'Oh, it's so depressing.' But I don't see that. I hope that the joy comes through. I think that Chloé got it. What more is there?

How NFTs are fueling a digital art boom,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

This article was updated following the auction of Beeple's ""Everydays: The First 5000 days,"" which sold for $69.3 million.

When graphic designer Mike Winkelmann started producing a drawing a day in 2007, he was simply looking for a way to improve his art skills. At best, the resulting ""Everydays"" project would help him promote his freelance work, which includes creating concert visuals for the likes of Justin Bieber and Katy Perry. But selling the digital images was not on his mind.

This week, a compilation of over 13 years' worth of the artworks, collectively titled ""Everydays: The First 5000 days,"" sold for $69.3 million via Christie's, putting Winkelmann's name among some of the art market's most valuable living artists.

""It's a bit surreal, because (digital imagery) wasn't really something that I pictured, in my lifetime, being able to sell,"" said Winkelman, who goes by the name Beeple, in a video call from his home in South Carolina ahead of the sale. ""So it (has) come out of nowhere. But at the same time, I also really feel like this is going to be the next chapter of art history.""

Virtual art has been created, and talked about, for years. But now, thanks to endorsement from celebrities as diverse as Elon Musk, Lindsey Lohan and Steve Aok i, online buzz in art and cryptocurrency circles, and, perhaps most importantly, blockchain technology, it has not only entered the mainstream -- it is generating huge sums of money for digital artists and online collectors.

Beeple's latest sale comes just weeks after his animated work "" Crossroad ,"" which imagined Donald Trump's naked, graffiti-strewn body slumped on the ground, was purchased online for $6.6 million. Elsewhere, a digital animation of the ""Nyan Cat"" meme -- a flying cat with a Pop Tart for a body -- earned its creator Christopher Torres almost $600,000 in a virtual auction. The musician Grimes meanwhile made $6.3 million in under 20 minutes selling a range of collectible digital artworks.

At the center of this explosion in transactions are non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Acting like virtual signatures, they address concerns that digital art's value is diminished by the ease with which it can be copied or lost.

While an oil painting can only be displayed in one place and has a definitive owner, a digital image, video or gif can be infinitely duplicated and enjoyed on screens around the world for free. This has often posed problems for prospective collectors, who don't know how to price digital art and fear it will lose resale value. But now, NFTs are offering two things that the physical art market has always depended on: scarcity and authenticity.

The rise of 'non-fungible' tokens

NFTs are built on blockchain technology, which -- just as it does with Bitcoin -- offers a secure record of transactions. This digital ledger serves as incorruptible proof of ownership, meaning that ""original"" artworks and their owners can always be identified via the blockchain, even if an image or video is widely replicated.

A ""fungible"" asset is one that is that can be replaced with another identical one of the same value, such as a dollar bill, while non-fungible ones, like NFTs, are tied to unique goods and are not mutually interchangeable.

Like bitcoins, the tokens can be kept in a virtual wallet. They can then be sold or traded, often gaining value in the secondary market. This makes NFT artworks similar to physical ones -- or any other real-world asset, according to Duncan Cock Foster, co-founder of Nifty Gateway, the platform behind Beeple's and Grimes' recent multi-million-dollar sales.

""We have systems for collecting paintings, and we have systems for collecting sculptures. But until now, people hadn't figured out a good way to collect digital art -- and NFTs allow you to do that,"" Cock Foster said on a video call, adding that buying tokens is easier and ""a lot more accessible"" than traditional art collecting.

Related video: Just how much has the internet changed art?

On Nifty Gateway, artists set the number of editions for any single artwork by deciding how many accompanying tokens will be made available. This can range from one-offs, where a piece is sold to a single collector, to open-edition ""drops,"" where tokens are made available for a limited period of time.

The sale of Grimes' ""WarNymph"" collection , for instance, allowed up to 9,999 purchases of various artworks within a seven-minute window. Several of the creations were listed for just $20 per token, some of which are now selling for thousands of dollars.

By connecting artists directly to collectors, NFTs effectively cut out galleries and other traditional gatekeepers. While Cock Foster would not disclose the size of Nifty Gateway's cut, he claims it is ""far less"" than what a gallery would usually take.

For Beeple, this represents a ""democratization"" of the art market. ""Now I have direct access to my audience,"" he said. ""I don't have to go through an intermediary.""

And there's another benefit for digital artists: They can continue making money on their work, even after it has been sold. NFTs can allow creators to receive a cut on all future transactions -- on Nifty Gateway, this is typically set at 10% -- breaking with the centuries-old model whereby artists do not directly benefit when sold works grow in value over their lifetimes. (For instance, when a David Hockney painting sold for $90.3 million in 2018 , setting an auction record for a living artist, the British artist didn't receive a single cent from the sale. His dealer had sold it for just $18,000 in 1972.)

So, while Beeple made less than $67,000 when he originally sold his ""Crossroad"" animation, he pocketed a further $660,000 when the initial buyer sold it on.

""The royalties are definitely something that make this much more sustainable and equitable for all parties,"" the designer said.

New breed of collector

The collector behind the $6.6 million ""Crossroad"" sale, Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile, said that supporting creators is one of the unique benefits of investing in NFTs. While there is money to be made, and plenty of speculation happening in the crypto art market, the 32-year-old said that collecting digital works is about more than money.

""I try to look into the life and career of the creators. I like to get in contact with them and meet them ... for me, it's important to see consistency and thoughtfulness about everything outside the art as well,"" said Rodriguez-Fraile on the phone, adding that he is drawn to works that are ""masterfully executed.""

Beyond ""Crossroad,"" Rodriguez-Fraile said he has collected hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of NFT artworks, selling only a handful so far.

While the Miami-based collector was previously interested in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, were it not for NFTs, he said he would not be involved in buying art. His experience, like Beeple's, suggests that the tokens are empowering a new breed of artists and collectors rather than taking a slice of the existing art market.

""The analogy I like to make is Uber,"" Cock Foster said. ""When they were trying to make a forecast for Uber's market size, they looked at the amount of money people spent on black cars (private car services). But because it's so much easier to call an Uber than it is to call a black car, the actual market ended up being much larger than that. I really think we're seeing something similar with NFTs.

""They are lowering the barriers to collecting significantly,"" added Cock Foster, whose platform operates under the ambitious tagline, ""We will not rest until 1 billion people are collecting NFTs.""

Future prospects

Nifty Gateway may be a long way from its goal of 1 billion collectors, but the platform's growth nonetheless reflects exploding interest in crypto art. In March 2020, the site recorded monthly transactions of $30,000; last month, this figure was up to $75 million, according to Cock Foster.

This jump broadly coincides with another major force in the art world: Covid-19. With galleries and auction houses shuttered around the world -- and people spending more time browsing the web or shopping online -- NFTs have offered a new outlet for art enthusiasts.

According to Beeple, this is why interest in the tokens has skyrocketed in recent months, even though the technology has been available since 2017.

""You keep hearing that Covid has pushed things 10 years forward, and I think this honestly is a big part of it,"" he said. ""Everybody was sitting at home over the last year -- so while I think this was inevitable, it really got accelerated.""

Why is art so expensive?

The use of NFTs is now stretching far beyond the art world. DJ and musician Deadmau5 has used the tokens to sell digital merchandise, while the new Kings of Leon album is being released as an NFT. Nike is even reported to have registered a patent for tokenized shoes, branded ""CryptoKicks.""

This rapid growth has led to fears of an NFT bubble -- one that may burst when the world emerges from pandemic-era restrictions. While collector Rodriguez-Fraile believes that ""NFTs are here to stay,"" he accepted that ""we might be going through a period of hype ... and I think the general ecosystem might slow down a bit when it comes to pricing.""

For Cock Foster, however, the return to normality presents opportunities rather than threats -- not least because galleries offer ways to experience digital art beyond a computer screen.

""Digital art is very, very immersive,"" he said, adding that displaying art is still important to online collectors. ""So, I think we can build some really cool physical experiences.""

The club kid designer dressing the most powerful women in US politics,"Written by Scarlett Conlon, CNN

There are times in every successful designer's career when they find something they created at the center of a viral sensation. For Max Mara's creative director, Ian Griffiths, discovering that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had ignited a global frenzy by wearing his red ""Fire Coat"" for her infamous showdown with Donald Trump in 2018 was one of those moments. It was not, however, quite as he had imagined it.

""It was 7 in the evening and I got the phone call from our American communications office. I had just got home from work and was in the middle of getting changed with my trousers around my knees,"" laughed Griffiths on the phone from his office in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy. ""They needed urgent confirmation the coat was ours, then more and more calls came in to give quotes. I spent the whole evening shuffling around my apartment with my trousers around my ankles because I didn't have time to take them off!

""That gives you an idea of how out of the blue it was.""

The moment may have caught the down-to-earth Griffiths off guard, but Max Mara was hardly a leftfield choice for Pelosi, who had worn the same coat to President Obama's second inauguration in 2013. The Italian brand, which is famed for its camel coats and marks its 70th anniversary this year, has always been about ""making real clothes for real women,"" said British-born Griffiths, who joined the label straight out of school in 1987 and has remained there ever since.

The designer recalled an early meeting with the brand's late founder, Achille Maramotti: ""He told (me) his intention was always to dress the wife of the local doctor or lawyer; he wasn't at all interested in dressing princesses or countesses in Rome. He chose so wisely because over the last 70 years those women (have risen up) and Max Mara went with them. Now rather than the wife of the doctor, they are the doctor, if not the director of (an) entire healthcare trust. ""

Griffiths can count Kamala Harris among the high-flying women who admire his creations. The US Vice President generated headlines for the brand last November when she was photographed wearing one of its grey military-inspired ""Deborah"" coats on the campaign trail in Philadelphia.

""She looked like a figure from the American War of Independence, with the flags in the background and raising her arm in the air ... it was such a powerful image,"" said Griffiths. With both Harris and Pelosi, he continued, ""it appeared they were not simply wearing (the coats) as a utility, but in a way that really made a statement (and) as a vehicle to say something I absolutely agree with."" It was, he admitted, incredibly rewarding.

Celebrating a legacy

Griffiths is acknowledging the brand's landmark anniversary this year by paying tribute to strong, independent women like Harris and Pelosi. In keeping with Maramotti's original vision, he may not be concerned with royalty per se, but he is intent on making clothes to empower women to rule the world.

It seems only fitting that Griffiths is helping Max Mara mark its 70th birthday with a special anniversary collection . Unveiled digitally at Milan Fashion week Thursday, the Fall-Winter 2021 line is as empowering as one has come to expect from the Italian label.

""Celebrating this tremendous event, I was thinking about the Max Mara woman as a triumphant self-made queen in a moment of jubilation at her ascent,"" he enthused.

The digital presentation kicked off with behind-the-scenes images of a model being enrobed in a Max Mara coat before taking to the circular runway inside the Triennale di Milano. The imposing curved space, which reminded Griffiths of London's Regent Street, was decked out in flags featuring symbols from the brand's archive to give the flavor of a coronation or parade. Among the symbols was a retro exclamation point that the designer discovered on 1950s Max Mara advertising from the brand's archive.

The symbol ""captures the entire spirit of the collection,"" he said. ""How (else) do you describe the sense of exhilaration and epic adventure of this 70-year ascent?""

Since its beginnings in 1951, Max Mara was obsessed with a love of all things ""authentically -- bordering on eccentrically -- British,"" Griffiths added. For this collection he looked to tractor-driving, helicopter-piloting, pioneering women by way of kilts (""traditional but also rooted in punk culture""); quilted coats made from pure camel hair; utilitarian jackets executed in sumptuous alpaca; organza shirts ""which are dramatically jaunty""; and chunky socks and walking boots.

According to the show notes, the collection is an ""urban country-mix"" with cocooning aran knits and slouchy tartan skirts. Credit: Max Mara

It is a collection of ""unconservative classics,"" he explained, which is also an apt description of the designer himself. Part free spirit, part quintessential gentleman, Griffiths is a former club kid turned creative commander of one of the world's oldest, most sophisticated luxury houses -- and he has a charming penchant for pocket squares. Given that he spent most of the UK's Covid-19 lockdown at his home in the Suffolk countryside, his collection's bucolic inspirations appear all the more personal.

""It's inevitable that a lot of my story goes into there,"" he said, pointing to the recent pictures on his Instagram account. ""Those images of my experiences being in the countryside over the summer, having long walks with my dogs, the way I used to dress 30 years ago, punk culture, the idea of an independent rebellious spirit, refusing to accept convention -- they are all ideas that are central to my thinking. Primarily, (however), I channel it so that it appeals to the Max Mara woman, as it's all about her.""

The pandemic's impact on Max Mara's customers was also an important consideration, Griffiths said.

""It's made me think very hard about who (she is) and appreciate even more greatly the struggles she has been through, which have been thrown into even sharper relief by what's happened over the last year,"" he said. ""I want to show her emerging from this hardship triumphantly.

""It's our 70-year celebration but it's also a collection that's timed for a moment next winter, 2021, when all over the world, restrictions will start to be lifted and people can enjoy the world they live in and celebrate.""

The upcoming collection is, he affirmed, a ""double celebration, in a sense"". In Griffiths' enthusiasm for design, sartorial expression and hope, Max Mara has much to celebrate, too.",
"Rosamund Pike in ""I Care a Lot"" and six more recommendations if you love an antiheroine","Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Keeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.

Fictional male antiheroes like television's crime patriarchs Tony Soprano and Walter White have reigned for some time, but the antiheroine has only more recently had the opportunity to rise up -- and become the cause of her own downfall.

And while a ""bad woman"" may once have meant a period-piece protagonist who prioritized herself over finding a husband, today's antiheroines are more complex, as the Netflix dark comedy ""I Care a Lot"" illustrates.

Rosamund Pike just picked up a Golden Globe for her portrayal of the film's icy-cool yet charismatic main character, Marla Grayson, a legal guardian who preys on seniors. Grayson sets the audience straight in her first few minutes on screen.

""Playing fair is a joke invented by rich people to keep the rest of us poor,"" she declares.

To avoid being exploited, Grayson exploits, building a company that places the eldery into her care while she drains their finances and cuts them off from their families. She does so with the help of an equally morally deficient doctor who feeds her new customers and a well-meaning, naive judge whose court orders are the strong arm in Grayson's elaborate system. She keeps portraits of her so-called ""cash cows"" tacked-up in her office, like the victims of a serial killer hung up on a detective's whiteboard.

'(She's) allowed to do the things that men have always been allowed to do'

Grayson is polished and ruthless and operates under her own code of feminism -- she can swindle people as much as any man -- to reign terror on people's lives. She is also willfully stubborn and refuses to back down when she messes with the wrong senior citizen, pulling her into a deadly set of circumstances that she believes she can blackmail her way out of.

Yet, as the film's screenwriter J Blakeson notes in a recorded interview for Netflix, she's ""smart and determined and focused and charismatic"" -- all the qualities we tend to strive for.

But while we may relate more to vulnerable, self-destructive female leads like Marvel's crime-fighting private eye Jessica Jones and assassin-hunting Eve Polastri of ""Killing Eve,"" or the brash dysfunction of the titular protagonist of ""Fleabag,"" Grayson is more impenetrable.

Among antiheroines, Grayson is a rarity: She is unequivocally irredeemable. She's given, perhaps intentionally, not much of a background story -- no children to justify her ill deeds, like Cersei Lannister does in ""Game of Thrones,"" and only a thin romantic storyline with her partner Fran, who's deep in it with her but slightly more shakeable. Grayson is the embodiment of the pitfalls of capitalism: She's greedy for greed's sake.

And that, according to Pike, is perhaps why you should root for her.

""She was everything I've wanted to see in a woman on screen -- (she's) allowed to do the things that men have always been allowed to do: be ruthless, ambitious... strive for exactly what she wants, shamelessly and unambiguously,"" Pike said in a recorded interview for Netflix. ""She has no fear of not being liked. She's out to win; she wants to make money -- all the things that have not been considered feminine qualities, she has them in spades.""

Grayson serves as an archetype for a female antihero not driven by much except for her own ambition, and she's quite fine with that. ""She shocks you,"" Pike added in the interview. ""But you kind of love the shock.""

""I Care a Lot"" is available to watch on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK.

Ballerina Chloé Lopes Gomes alleged racism at her company. Now she says it's time for change,"Written by Chloé Lopes Gomes

Chloé Lopes Gomes was the first Black ballet dancer to join the Berlin Staatsballett. All opinions expressed in this article belong to the author.

In 2018 I became the first Black ballet dancer to join Berlin's principal ballet company, the Staatsballett. Joining this kind of ballet institution was my dream -- it's one of the best in the world.

But last October, I was told that my contract would not be renewed this summer. I believe it's because of the complaints I have made about the racist comments and unfair treatment that I have endured from my ballet mistress, though the company has said the decision was made for ""artistic reasons."" After trying to handle the issue internally, I went public with my story to Der Spiegel The Guardian and the New York Times

I have suffered depression and humiliation -- and I am far from the only dancer who has experienced derogatory comments and verbal abuse during my career. Such behavior is institutionalized within ballet, from the time that we are children and begin our training. We don't talk about it because we are taught not to.

We start ballet very young, often when we are just seven or eight years old. The teachers instill in us discipline and rigor, but they also teach us not to complain -- to suffer in silence and to be ""polite."" Many young dancers are trained to believe that, to become a ballerina, pain is part of the process. Ballet masters should treat dancers respectfully and with kindness.

The silence is pervasive as well because we often don't have enough support or protection. The power that institutions give to the ballet masters is undeniable -- at the end of the day, they are the ones who are with us in the studio and they are the ones who give us the opportunity to improve within the company. We only have one- or two-year renewable contracts. And the ballet world is very small. Speaking out against an esteemed company can ruin a career.

My experience with racism is not isolated. I have heard over and over the damaging stereotypes that Black dancers aren't flexible enough or don't have the right feet, or that Asian dancers aren't expressive enough. Ballet is still designed for White dancers, down to the shoes and makeup we wear. Nude-colored ballet shoes for Black dancers didn't exist until 2018. I've always had to buy my own makeup, because the foundation provided has always been for White skin. I've always been the only dancer to do my own hair, because the hair stylists don't know how to work with my texture. At Staatsballett, there are 95 dancers and I was the only one spending my own money on makeup. It makes you feel excluded. And it reminds me that when you are Black, you have to work harder to have the same opportunities.

""I've always had to buy my own makeup, because the foundation provided has always been for White skin,"" writes Gomes. Credit: Dean Barucija

The ballet world needs to change, and we have the chance to do so now, while the art form has been thrown into crisis during the coronavirus pandemic. In order for the performing arts to survive, they have to reach new audiences. In ballet, which is still primarily White and elitist, we have to make it more accessible, and we can do that by making it a more inclusive and equitable art form.

We should attract talented and diverse young dancers in ballet schools and begin to remake ballet companies from the ground up to reflect the multicultural world we live in. We should put an end to the dangerous belief that dancers must always remain silent, which is drilled into us at a young age. And we should give dancers proper avenues of recourse when their teachers or directors abuse their power.

The Classical arts in general have long excluded ethnic minorities because they are prohibitively expensive for underprivileged communities. It is expensive to attend the theater -- and it is even more expensive to train in the arts. It is much cheaper to go to the cinema or to play sports. I was raised in France with a very modest upbringing. My mother is a cleaning lady, and my father is a construction worker. They took out loans for what my scholarship didn't cover when I attended the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Russia, following in the footsteps of two of my siblings, who are also dancers. I had to be successful; there was so much pressure on me to excel.

""I have a different vision for the future of the stage,"" Gomes writes. ""Diversity isn't detrimental to the visuals of ballet."" Credit: Dean Barucija

I believe we have to democratize ballet in order to ensure its future. If ballet companies welcome more people of all backgrounds to attend its shows, more young people will fall in love with it. If ballet school directors make it their duty to seek out and nurture those aspiring dancers, and level the playing field regardless of race or income level, diverse dancers will enter the ranks. They will eventually become ballet masters, attracting and educating more dancers of color. And then the cycle continues -- more children will see themselves represented on stage; they will see a future in pointe shoes.

Ballet prizes uniformity within its dancers. We have to transform into swans or spirits, to become part of a greater whole of movement and form. But I have a different vision for the future of the stage. It's so beautiful to see a blonde girl next to a Black girl, or a brown girl next to an Asian girl, all following the same choreography. Diversity isn't detrimental to the visuals of ballet -- it can instead be its greatest strength.",
Pokémon at 25: How 151 fictional species took over the world,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

When the Game Boy titles ""Pocket Monsters: Red"" and ""Pocket Monsters: Green"" were first released in Japan in 1996, few could have predicted what came next.

The concept was simple enough: Players would traverse a fictional world capturing, training and battling the creatures that inhabited it -- a mission encapsulated in the game's famous slogan, ""Gotta Catch 'Em All."" But within just a few years, Pokémon, a portmanteau of the Japanese name ""Poketto Monsuta,"" was a global phenomenon.

By 1999, the game had launched in multiple Western markets, later becoming one of the most successful franchises of all time. It spawned an anime series, which was translated into over 30 languages, and trading cards that swept the world's playgrounds during the ""Pokémania"" of the late 1990s.

It also imprinted the identities of 151 entirely fictional characters into the memories of millions.

A quarter of a century on, many first-generation Pokémon are as recognizable to millennials as they are to their children. This is partly thanks to a post-2016 revival inspired by the mobile game ""Pokémon Go"" and movie ""Detective Pikachu."" But the franchise's success is about more than clever marketing -- it is the result of unique characters that were universal enough to cross cultures and diverse enough to make catching 'em all a challenge, not a chore.

Their origins trace back to Pokémon's creator Tajiri Satoshi, whose childhood love of collecting bugs inspired a game with a strikingly similar premise. Most of the individual designs were, however, the work of illustrator Ken Sugimori.

Sugimori had worked with Tajiri on the magazine Game Freak, which would eventually grow into the games company behind Pokémon. As the firm's art director, he brought his collaborator's vision to life through a complex and imaginative taxonomy, complete with individual lines of evolution and fictional genuses, like grass- or dragon-type Pokémon.

Giving the characters distinct personalities was always going to be difficult. Even with an accompanying TV series, most were only able to utter their own names repeatedly. Their appearances, therefore, were especially important.

Sugimori's designs were gloriously diverse and grounded in science -- not just biology and zoology, but geology (see Geodude, who was essentially an animated rock), chemistry (the noxious gas clouds Koffing and Weezing), paleontology (the fossil-like Omanyte and Omastar) and physics (the likes of Magneton, who loosely drew on the principles of electromagnetism). The resulting catalog of creatures, known as the Pokédex , was essentially a periodic table for game nerds -- and was, for many, much easier to recall.

Going global

Pokémon's ability to evolve was part of their appeal, according to Joseph Tobin, a professor of early childhood education at the University of Georgia and editor of the 2004 book ""Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon"" (a subtitle that, he readily admits, completely failed to predict the franchise's revival).

""Along with Tamagotchi, the narrative was that you're caring for them,"" Tobin said in a video interview. ""You care for them so they grow up, and kids can identify with getting stronger. But then you also care for them by (making sure they) don't die. It was unusual to have this in a battle game ... it took some of the features of war and then combined them with nurturance.""

This juxtaposition was reflected in the designs, which were at once both cute and fierce -- or, through the process of evolution, morphed from cute to fierce, from the big-eyed, babyish Squirtle to the formidable Blastoise (by way of Wartortle). None, however, more aptly embodied this dichotomy than Pikachu, the franchise's most successful and marketable figure. Dumpy and rosy-cheeked, with a high-pitched voice, the electrified mouse was also a powerful fighter.

The character's design also played into Japan's wider drive to export pop culture in the 1990s, according to Tobin.

""The idea was -- or the corporate strategy as a nation was -- we want 'our' mouse to compete with Mickey Mouse,"" he said. ""So I think the fact that Pikachu is a mouse-like creature is not coincidental, but (the character) was made to be hyper-cute -- cuter than Mickey or Minnie.""

There were, however, fears that Japan's ""kawaii"" aesthetic wouldn't resonate with kids elsewhere. Superheroes in Western markets were, at the time, often sharper and more muscular than their Japanese counterparts. Ahead of the game's US release, late Nintendo boss Hiroshi Yamauchi was reportedly shown a beefed-up alternative version of Pikachu, though the company's American subsidiary stuck with the original designs for its 1998 launch.

But while the likes of Pikachu and Bulbasaur stole the limelight -- and made it into the all-important merchandise -- there was strength in sheer diversity. And some among Pokémon's vast cast were neither cute nor fierce.

Take Diglett, a crudely-drawn sausage-shaped mole, or Metapod, a droopy-eyed and immobile chrysalis, whose sole ability is hardening its outer shell. All were relatively useless in battle; none were the schoolyard's most sought-after playing cards. But they were part of a complete universe -- one that had something for everyone. In the gender-normative world of 1990s toy marketing, that mattered, Tobin said.

""At the toy store (at the time) you had a blue aisle and a pink aisle,"" he said. ""But Pokémon was created to reach across the aisles.""

The art of localization

While the characters' designs remained the same overseas, Pokémon was nonetheless adapted for different markets, especially when it came to language.

Cultural references would, inevitably, be lost in translation: Many characters were rooted in Japanese folklore . While audiences in Japan might have recognized the influence of fox spirit Kitsune in Pokémon like Vulpix, or the mythical thunder beast Rajiu in Pikachu's design, these would never translate.

But the Pokémon's new names often remained true to the spirit of the originals. Take Sawamura and Ebiwara, who had been named after a Japanese kickboxer and boxer, respectively, but were called Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan in English, a reference to martial artists that kids in the West would recognize: Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Or Ivysaur, whose Japanese name Fushigisou combined ""fushigi"" (strange) and ""sou"" (grass), resulting in a similar principle being used for the French version: Herbizarre.

Some names, like Pikachu, were transliterated more or less directly from the Japanese. But elsewhere there were portmanteaus like Psyduck (a duck with psychic powers), or names that only resonated with speakers of the language in question, like the slothful Slowpoke. There were also puns of varying quality, from the jellyfish-like Tentacool, to Exeggcute, a collection of furious eggs.

Some were a little less imaginative. There was a horned seal called Seel, and a crab named Krabby. The serpentine Ekans and Arbok were made simply by reversing the words ""snake"" and ""kobra"" (sic). But there were moments of linguistic sophistication, too. The game's three ""Legendary Birds"" were named Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres, with the Spanish suffixes -uno, -dos and -tres reflecting their consecutive order in the Pokédex. An amorphous blob, able to assume the form of anything it saw, was named, appropriately, Ditto.

The anime series was also subtly adapted for overseas markets. For instance, human characters were more central to the US version's narrative, because it was believed that ""Americans wanted someone to identify with that was more than just bugs and animals,"" Tobin said. But, he added, Pokémon always retained something quintessentially Japanese.

""I think the amazing thing is that it wasn't changed that much. Not only was the Japanese-ness not a liability, it was associated with 'cool Japan.' Kids didn't like it because it was Japanese, but they certainly got the idea that it was a little bit exotic,"" he said, likening it to a type of soft power for the country.

'Inter-generational nostalgia'

The designs kept on coming. Today, there are almost 900 characters, though many are, arguably, less memorable than their predecessors. Later generations of Pokémon have included Chandelure , a sentient chandelier, Milcery , a cream-based Pokémon resembling a splash of milk, and, inexplicably, a floating keyring called Klefki that is ""constantly collecting keys... (and) will protect them no matter what.""

Affection for the first generation endures, however. The original 151 may represent just a fraction of the Pokédex, but they account for over half of the Pokémon featured in the 2019 movie ""Detective Pikachu."" In December, a first-edition holographic Charizard card sold for a record $369,000.

Tobin, having failed to predict Pokémon's longevity last time around, is more optimistic about the franchise's next 25 years.

""I was wrong in that I thought Pokémon would, like most kids' media or cultural products, rise and fall and be replaced by the next big thing,"" he said. ""But I think what I, and the other authors in the book, got right was (understanding) what made Pokémon so attractive at the time. And the things that made it attractive were not limited to the culture of the 1990s.

""I think it's become one of these very rare products that will, now, never end, because it's so much in the popular imagination,"" he added. ""It has this inter-generational value of nostalgia, in the way that parents who grew up with Barbie now might want to (buy them for) their kids, or people who grew up with baseball cards want to do that with their kids.

""It becomes self-recognizable -- there's value to its own fame.""

Debates over Beijing's derelict Old Summer Palace are about more than history,"Written by Paul French Oscar Holland, CNN

Paul French is the author of books including ""Midnight in Peking: How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China,"" and ""Through the Looking Glass: China's Foreign Journalists from Opium Wars to Mao.""

Northeast of Beijing's resplendent Summer Palace lie the ruins of another stately structure, burned to the ground by European forces during the Second Opium War.

Once an elaborate network of pavilions, palaces, bridges and gardens, Yuanmingyuan -- ""The Garden of Perfect Brightness,"" known simply as the Old Summer Palace in English -- is now little more than collections of rubble amid a network of tranquil lakes. In 1860, Britain's High Commissioner to China, Lord Elgin, ordered troops to destroy both the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace to avenge the killing of several British envoys to Beijing. By striking sites of cultural and imperial significance, Elgin wanted to chasten China.

But with the Old Summer Palace still in ruins, he instead created a shrine that, more than a century on, is used by the country's leadership to remind its people of past foreign aggression.

Each year, tens of thousands of visitors arrive to see its broken pillars and stone bricks, which dot an unkempt landscape of grass and weeds. They are potent symbols of China's ""century of humiliation,"" the term Beijing uses to describe the period from the start of the Opium War in 1839 to the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.

Over the decades, scholars and experts in China have suggested that the palace be rebuilt in order to celebrate the grandeur of China's past, thus banishing, rather than indulging, the memory of subjugation. The site could, ultimately, emulate the success of the neighboring Summer Palace, which was since rebuilt and has become one of China's most popular visitor destinations.

However, the National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA), the government agency responsible for protecting cultural relics, ruled out the latest restoration proposal in November.

The site's value lies in its ""historical status of being destroyed by foreign aggressors,"" the agency said in a statement. ""The site and its ruins serve as a warning to our descendants that they shall never forget the national humiliation."" In a country where vestiges of the past are either zealously restored to their former glory or cleared to make way for new developments, the decision to leave the palace in ruins is conspicuous in its inaction. To some critics, the announcement was both a pointed political gesture and a symptom of patriotism that is not simply pro-China, but anti-foreign.

A masterpiece of design

From the early 18th century, the Old Summer Palace grew into an exclusive getaway resort for the ruling elite of China's Qing dynasty. Its architectural splendor has since been compared to France's Palace of Versailles.

""It was actually a combination of five garden residences of the Qing emperors,"" said Ying-chen Peng, a professor and Chinese art specialist at Washington D.C.'s American University, in a phone interview. ""And in each garden residence, you have clusters of buildings and even artificial lakes, ponds and water systems. It really was a gem of Chinese architecture.""

Although construction started during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the early 1700s, the complex underwent a major expansion under his grandson the Qianlong Emperor's rule. As well as increasing the complex in size, he also sought to diversify its architecture, which until then was typical of the country's north, according to Peng.

""He treated it as a miniature (version) of his empire. He made several trips to southern China ... and he was enchanted by its beauty,"" she said of the emperor's so-called ""inspection tours,"" during which he would visit temples and mausoleums on official business as he consolidated power across the vast empire. ""After he returned from these trips, he would order his architects to replicate famous scenes or sites that he had seen and appreciated.""

Examples offered by Peng include Ruyuan (Garden of Ease), a replica of a garden in China's former capital, Nanjing, and Anlanyuan (or Tranquil Wave Garden), which was based on a garden of the same name in Haining, Zhejiang province.

More unusually for the time, Qianlong also commissioned Jesuit missionaries to design several European-style palaces and fountains. These structures represent what Peng called ""hybrid"" architecture, which saw Western stone facades built over traditional Chinese wooden frames. (Because stone has proven more durable than wood, the remains of these Italian baroque-style buildings are now among the most prominent of the Old Summer Palace's ruins, despite constituting a small minority of the original structures).

""Even though they were missionaries, they were actually sort of 'Renaissance men' by training -- musicians, painters or even engineers,"" Peng said. ""So, for the court, they were not treated as missionaries, but as people who could realize the Emperor's fascination with exotic cultures.""

The palace also served as a storage site for some of the nation's most treasured art and artifacts. When Anglo-French soldiers arrived on Elgin's orders to ransack it, they stole many of the items before burning the buildings to the ground. Perhaps most famous among the looted treasures were a dozen bronze animal heads, representing the 12 animals of the zodiac, which China has long sought to reclaim from overseas. (More than half have now made their way back to the country via auctions and donations, with their return often depicted in Chinese media as something of a national quest -- and even inspiring a 2012 Jackie Chan action movie on the subject. Five of the statues remain missing to this day.)

Meanwhile, the nearby Summer Palace (sometimes called the ""new"" Summer Palace, to avoid confusion) has benefited from multiple rebuilds since being ransacked. Nearly 30 years after the initial assault, Empress Dowager Cixi, then China's de facto supreme leader, ordered some of its damaged imperial structures to be rebuilt, and gave them the name Yiheyuan (""Garden of Good Health and Harmony"").

The revamped complex and its lavish gardens survived further turmoil and were added to UNESCO's World Heritage List as a ""masterpiece of Chinese garden landscape design"" In 1998. The Old Summer Palace, however, was left to stagnate.

Restoration debate

By the early 20th century, the Old Summer Palace had become a repository for building materials. Nearby structures were often made from, or at least decorated with, debris taken from the ruins. During Mao's rule, which saw famines associated with the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution campaigns, farmers encroached on the land in desperate attempts to grow more food. It later became known as a place where artists lived and worked in the 1980s and early 1990s -- or "" squatted ,"" as the authorities saw it. They were eventually kicked out.

Since the start of China's reform era in the late 1970s, however, a number of grand plans have been floated to restore the Old Summer Palace. In 1984, a proposal to partially restore several pavilions emerged, and in the 1990s, there were also plans to use foreign investment to fund a miniature replica of the Old Summer Palace on the site, though neither scheme transpired. A restoration plan was finally approved in 2000, though archeological and environmental experts were ""quick to denounce it,"" according to a 2006 editorial in the Australian National University's China Heritage Quarterly.

""The contretemps about whether the park be preserved as it was, partially restored, partially rebuilt or fully restored raged in the print media for some months, and every time a new incident involving the gardens occurs the familiar battle lines are redrawn and the debate unfolds anew,"" it read.

The latest reconstruction proposal was championed by Yan Jianguo, a Beijing-based lawyer and delegate in China's legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC). In May 2020, at the NPC's annual meeting, Yan argued that his vision for the project, which would include the extensive restoration of buildings and gardens, was essential for ""educational and patriotic purposes.""

China's leaders did not agree. And neither, perhaps, would the Chinese public. Although conducted around a decade ago, before the most recent rebuild proposal had emerged, an online poll by Sina news found that 77% of respondents opposed a rebuild, with many reportedly citing the potential cost of the project.

Having said that, price concerns have hardly been prohibitive when it comes to major heritage projects in China. For instance, since 2005, the central government has allocated 1.9 billion yuan ($294 million) to a long-term project to restore the Great Wall section by section. The entire ancient town of Dukezong in Shangri-la county, Yunnan province, was meanwhile rebuilt at a cost of 1.2 billion yuan ($186 million) after a 2014 fire, according to Chinese state media.

But the expense involved in rebuilding the entire Old Summer Palace could be uniquely astronomical. In 2008, a full-size replica of the complex -- essentially a large movie set with some surrounding landscaping -- was built at Hengdian World Studios in Zhejiang province at reported cost of 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) . And restoring the Beijing original would be ""definitely more expensive than that,"" Peng speculated.

Looking to the future

For Peng, the debate is not merely about whether to restore the palace, but how it might be done. She welcomed the rejection of the most recent proposal on the grounds that too many questions remain unresolved.

""When we talk about reconstruction in architecture, it's actually a package. It is not only about the structures per se,"" she said.

""How do we deal with the interior?"" she offered as an example. ""Are we going to leave it empty, or are we going to try to replicate the interior design and furnish it with authentic items? If the project is to pursue that path, it would definitely be much more expensive and also controversial, because to what degree can we then call it an authentic construction?""

Other proposals have suggested simply building a museum to display and protect some of the treasures once housed at the palace. One structure on the site, the old Zhengjue Temple, was in fact recently rebuilt in order to exhibit one of the returned zodiac animal heads, while other government efforts have focused on landscaping and renovating the man-made lakes.

Writer and historian of the Qing dynasty Jeremiah Jenne, who has been based in Beijing since 2002 and regularly visits the Old Summer Palace with students, believes that a complete rebuild is not required. But, he said, the history of the ruins could nonetheless be better explained to visitors. There is no central plaque or memorial, he noted, suggesting this could be achieved using virtual reality technology, which many museums are now using worldwide.

""Ruins have power, allowing you to use your imagination, which can add poignancy to the visitor experience,"" he said.

Experts from Tsinghua University have gone some way toward recreating the Old Summer Palace in digital form. According to state media , researchers studied more than 10,000 historical files to make more than 4,000 design charts and 2,000 digital architecture models. Combined, they show at least 60% of the original structure.

This kind of digital reimagining may be as close as we can get to experiencing the original splendor of the imperial complex, given that the most recent proposal for the Old Summer Palace -- among the most extensive and ambitious plans to restore the ruins to date -- appears to be dead in the water, But it probably won't be long before another plan surfaces and reignites the debate of what to do with the site, and how to reinterpret China's ""century of humiliation.""

""I'm just glad that we have seen the dimension of the discussion grow more and more diverse,"" Peng said, ""because in the '80s and '90 it was just seen (in terms of) the shame of China's past. Now, there's a new take that sees it as (part of) the glory of China in the 18th century ... so it will be interesting to observe how it will be discussed in the future, and how those discussions reflect the Chinese mentality.""",
Our colorful clothes are killing the environment,"Textile dyeing is one of the most polluting aspects of the global fashion industry, devastating the environment and posing health hazards to humans.

Asian rivers are turning black. And our colorful closets are to blame

This story was produced as part of CNN Style's The September Issues , a hub for facts, features and opinions about fashion, the climate crisis, and you.

When Haji Muhammad Abdus Salam looks across the trash-filled river near his home in one of Dhaka's major garment manufacturing districts, he remembers a time before the factories moved in.

""When I was young there were no garment factories here. We used to grow crops and loved to catch different kinds of fish. The atmosphere was very nice,"" he said from Savar, just north of the Bangladesh capital.

The river beside him is now black like an ink stain. Abdus Salam said waste from nearby garment factories and dye houses has polluted the water.

""There are no fish now,"" he said. ""The water is so polluted that our children and grandchildren cannot have the same experience.""

Bangladesh is the world's second biggest garment manufacturing hub after China, exporting $34 billion worth of garments in 2019. And clothes made, dyed and finished in the country often end up in main street shops across the United States and Europe.

But as consumers browse through the season's latest color trends, few will spare much thought to the dyes used to create everything from soft pastels to fluorescent hues -- or their toxic history.

Fashion is responsible for up to one-fifth of industrial water pollution, thanks in part to weak regulation and enforcement in producer countries like Bangladesh, where wastewater is commonly dumped directly into rivers and streams. The discharge is often a cocktail of carcinogenic chemicals, dyes, salts and heavy metals that not only hurt the environment, but pollute essential drinking water sources.

Bangladesh's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said it was ""striving towards minimizing the negative effect on environment from the largest export generating sectors including ready-made garments and textiles.""

Minister Shahab Uddin said in a statement e-mailed to CNN that a range of measures were being taken to address pollution, including updating conservation and environmental laws, imposing fines on polluters, monitoring water quality, setting up centralized treatment plants, and working with international development partners to improve wastewater treatment.

""Monitoring and enforcement activities ... are playing a vital role in combating the pollution caused by illegal polluting industries. We have a policy and legal framework in place to address the environmental pollution issues of the country,"" he said.

Ridwanul Haque, chief executive of the Dhaka-based NGO Agroho, called toxic chemical pollution a ""huge problem in a country like Bangladesh."" Haque, whose organization provides clean drinking water and free medical care to marginalized communities, said the rivers and canals that run through Dhaka have turned a ""pitch black color"" due to the sludge and sewage produced by textile dyeing and processing factories. The water is ""very thick ... like tar,"" and during the winter -- when monsoon rain no longer dilutes the wastewater -- ""you can smell it,"" he said.

One 55-year-old, who has lived in Savar for the past 18 years and didn't want to be identified for fear of reprisals, said the polluted waterways are a risk to his family's health.

""The kids get sick if they stay here,"" he said, adding that his two children and grandson are unable to live with him ""because of the water.""

Cost of color

The fashion industry uses around 93 billion cubic meters (21 trillion gallons) of water annually, enough to fill 37 million Olympic swimming pools, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Along with finishing, dyeing is the most polluting and energy-intensive processes involved in making our clothes.

Finishing is when chemicals or treatments are applied to fabric to give it the desired look or feel -- such as bleaching, softening or making the garment water resistant or anti-wrinkle. Large amounts of water and chemicals are also used during dyeing, to ensure vivid colors bind to the fabric and don't fade or wash out.

Take denim as an example.

Producing a single pair of jeans consumes around 7,500 liters (2,000 gallons) of water, from growing raw cotton to finished product, according to the United Nations.

To ensure its blue color, the thread or fabric is repeatedly dunked in huge vats of synthetic indigo dye. After dyeing, the denim is treated and washed with more chemicals to soften or texture it. Getting the faded or ""worn in"" look requires even more chemical bathing, which uses acids, enzymes, bleach and formaldehyde.

But jeans aren't the only polluters.

""Every season we know that the fashion industry needs to highlight new colors,"" said Ma Jun, one of China's leading environmentalists, in a phone interview. But, he added, ""each time you have a new color you're going to use more, new kinds of chemicals and dye stuffs and pigments and catalysts.""

Once they're done, the cheapest way for factories to get rid of unusable, chemical-laden wastewater is to dump it into nearby rivers and lakes.

Not all of the chemicals and solvents used are hazardous, though the World Bank has identified 72 toxic ones that stem solely from textile dyeing. Once in waterways, they accumulate to the point where light is prevented from penetrating the surface, reducing plants' ability to photosynthesize. This lowers oxygen levels in the water, killing aquatic plants and animals.

Also among them are chemicals and heavy metals that can build up in the body, increasing the risk of various cancers, acute illnesses and skin problems. Others have been found to increase in toxicity as they work their way up the food chain.

Chemical-laden water is also used to irrigate crops, with one recent study finding that textile dyes were present in vegetables and fruit grown around Savar.

Once in the wastewater, dyeing chemicals are difficult to remove, said Sarah Obser, head of sustainability at PFI Hong Kong, a company that provides environmental and factory audits in Asia. ""The substances don't degrade so they remain in the environment.""

While various types of dyes are used for different fabrics, azo dyes -- synthetic nitrogen-based dyes -- have come under particular scrutiny from the fashion industry and environmentalists. They are commonly used in garment manufacturing and produce bold colors like bright reds or yellows.

But some azo dyes under certain conditions break down and release aromatic amines, a type of chemical compound (also used in pesticides and pharmaceuticals) that can increase the risk of cancer. These are so toxic that the European Union, China, Japan, India and Vietnam have all banned their use and import.

Human impact

Water pollution from the textile industry is a huge problem across garment-producing countries, most of which are found in Asia due to its huge pool of cheap labor.

When environmentalist Ma founded the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) over a decade ago, many rivers and lakes in China -- the world's largest clothes manufacturer -- were so polluted that they were effectively dead, he said.

Since 2006, his NGO has developed pollution databases to monitor companies' environmental performance, tested water sources and color-coded rivers and lakes according to how polluted they are.

""In regions with concentrations of these dyes, we have seen some of the lakes in China contaminated to (such) a level that they are no longer good for use,"" said Ma.

Workers and people living close to factories often bear the brunt of the pollution. According to Ma, fishermen living near dye houses and textile mills along the tributaries of the Qiantang River have seen their catches shrink. ""They have lost their livelihoods because of it,"" he added.

In Bangladesh, the Savar resident who did not want to be named said he doesn't go into the water around his neighborhood anymore.

""This water causes sores on the body,"" he said, adding that people washing their hands or faces in the water have experienced fevers and skin irritation.

NGO executive Haque, whose organization sends mobile clinics to poorer communities around the country, said the toxic sludge also contaminates freshwater sources, because people use shallow wells.

""People don't have any other option so they have to ... drink (from) it. They are hopeless, they don't have money to install a filter or drill (for) deep water,"" he said.

Gastrointestinal problems and skin diseases are among the common ailments that he attributes directly to textile pollution.

CNN has reached out to Bangladesh's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Directorate of General Health Services, and Dhaka health officials for comment.

The chemicals used to dye clothes also impact garment workers who, in some factories, don't have adequate protective clothing and may inhale toxic fumes. In Dhaka, experts say there are a growing number of factories that comply with international standards on chemical use and management, but there are still many smaller or subcontracted factories where conditions continue to fall short.

""People don't have gloves or sandals, they're barefoot, they don't have masks, and they are working with dangerous chemicals or dyes in a congested area. They are like sweat factories,"" Haque said, from firsthand accounts that he's heard while working within communities tied to factories.

But because the textile industry is hugely important to Bangladesh's economy, accounting for 20% of its GDP and employing about 4 million people, residents like Abdus Salam don't want to see factories shuttered.

""Many of our people are working in these factories,"" he said. ""If they close these factories, the workers will become jobless.""

Shift in attitudes

But change is happening. In Bangladesh, there are signs textile producers are taking environmental responsibility more seriously, with brands committing to initiatives, such as the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), that tackle water, energy and chemical use in the industry.

And some Bangladeshi factories have environmental ""best practices and are developing their own connections"" with suppliers, said PFI Hong Kong's Obser. But ""it remains a challenge to fully eliminate those smaller non-compliant ones because the fashion industry is very intransparent and price focused,"" she added, saying many companies do not have the training, knowledge or the funds to treat wastewater discharge or invest in new waterless or environmentally-friendly technologies.

Bangladesh's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said it has made it mandatory for all polluting facilities to install effluent treatment plants and operate them ""optimally."" And under a new environmental policy called Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), textile dyeing, finishing and washing industries ""must submit a time-bound plan to reduce, recycle and reuse the wastewater,"" Uddin said.

""There is definitely room for further improvement,"" though rapid urbanization, high economic growth and industrialization all exacerbate the country's environmental problems. ""These challenges cannot be eliminated overnight,"" he added.

Other countries have also been taking steps. In China, a range of tough new environmental policies have been enacted in the past few years, including a 2017 crackdown on textile and other polluting factories that saw the temporary closure of thousands that were found to be flouting environmental laws. In 2018, the Chinese government introduced a new environment protection tax aimed at cutting polluting discharge, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.

Ma said factories and dye houses are increasingly being moved into industrial zones with centralized wastewater treatment plants, or being threatened with fines and closure if they don't comply with regulations.

Results have been ""dramatic,"" with many of the dead, black rivers he once saw coming back to life.

recent study found that such efforts have improved water quality in some regions but toxic and polluted water still persists in parts of the country.

The fashion industry as a whole has undergone what Greenpeace East Asia's Toxics Campaign Manager Ada Kong describes as ""a paradigm shift"" in its awareness of how chemicals are impacting the environment.

Greenpeace's ongoing ""Detox My Fashion"" campaign that aims to eliminate hazardous chemicals from the fashion industry has, since 2011, seen big brands like H&M, Adidas and Levi's committing to identifying suppliers and implementing tougher environmental regulations and chemical management in their factories and supply chains.

There has also been a push for innovation in finding alternative chemicals and new technologies leading to the development of more environmentally-friendly dyes

Mountain to climb

Many problems remain, however. For instance, China's centralized treatment plants sometimes can't cope with the volume of wastewater produced in its new industrial parks. And existing factories, saddled with costly treatment processes, often build secret discharge pipes or release their wastewater at night to avoid detection, Ma said.

CNN has reached out to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment for comment.

It also remains incredibly hard for consumers to navigate the complex web of supply chains the fashion industry is built on, even if they try to shop ethically . Often, fashion brands don't own their own factories so ""their relationships are not stable,"" with their many suppliers, said Kong.

""They may only work with that supplier for two months, or shorter, for a batch of goods and then shift to another one. This is not good for auditing or ensuring the suppliers are responsible for the environment.""

And while strides towards traceability and accountability have been made, there are still many brands and manufacturers not taking sustainability seriously, experts say.

""The mission has not yet been accomplished,"" said Ma.

Some experts believe the drive needs to come from big brands, which can encourage factories to build water treatment plants or invest in chemical-free technologies by committing to long-term contracts, even if costs rise.

""(What we're) asking for is that brands build a strong and long-lasting relationship with their suppliers, so they can have more say in their environmental performance,"" said Kong.

Yet, ridding the fashion industry of hazardous chemicals is likely to become even more challenging as our clothing addiction increases. Apparel consumption is set to rise by 63% to 102 million tons a year in 2030, according to a 2017 Pulse of the Fashion report.

""For the volume we are consuming, I don't think there is a solution or best scenario without reducing the volume of our consumption,"" Kong said. ""Even if all of us dress in organic cotton and natural dyes it would still be devastating.""

In Bangladesh, those living along Savar's black, contaminated rivers say they still feel helpless to stop the factories from polluting. Many fear repercussions from factory owners who often hold significant influence or political sway.

Frustration appears to be building nonetheless. And if authorities don't take further measures to clean up the water, Savar resident Abdus Salam said, then ""the future of this area will be full of darkness.""

6 ingenious designs for our 'age of crisis',"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

A global callout for innovative new designs has attracted over 500 entries addressing the great challenges of our time, from flooding and traffic congestion to aging societies and remote working.

The initiative, dubbed ""Design in an Age of Crisis,"" welcomed a range of proposals -- including pop-up gardens and musical instruments made of trash -- from over 50 countries.

Arranged by the London Design Biennale and Chatham House, a British policy institute, the initiative called for ""radical design ideas to tackle critical issues facing society,"" according to a press release.

Entries span four categories: health, environment, society and work. And while not all proposals directly responded to Covid-19, each category's brief reflected ""problems created or exacerbated by the pandemic,"" organizers said.

A selection of designs is being presented online and at a physical exhibition during the biennale in June. For now, here are six of the most eye-catching proposals.

Airdropped emergency shelters

The Radical Gravity project proposes a futuristic solution for people displaced by natural disasters, conflict or climate change: A global response system whereby emergency shelters are airdropped into position.

An airplane would release up to 500 units, known as Gravitons, that form parachutes in mid-air. After safely landing, they would, in theory, auto-inflate into networks of habitable pods designed to collect rainwater and generate energy.

The team behind the project suggests that this would offer a fast and efficient way to deliver relief in dangerous or hard-to-reach disaster zones.

Social distancing accessories

Anna-Sophie Dienemann

Social distancing, a term once rarely used outside public health circles, has entered common parlance during the Covid-19 pandemic. But old habits die hard.

To help us keep our distance when in public, conceptual fashion designer Anna-Sophie Dienemann has produced a range of colorful accessories that protect the wearer's personal space while preventing them from encroaching on others'.

Coming in various colors and abstract shapes, the items -- part of a project titled ""Bounding Spaces"" -- can be worn at waist or shoulder height. They can fold up close to the body, then pop back open in one quick movement.

Trash instruments

Andrew Scott

Artist and designer Andrew Scott has designed a series of musical instruments using trash and other found materials. By extending the lifespan of waste products and turning them into cheap string and wind instruments, he hopes to simultaneously address problems of pollution and a lack of access to arts education.

Among his creations are a flute made from a broken broom and bagpipes with plastic bags for bellows. They are fully functional, and composer Hangrui Zhang of London's Royal College of Music has even created music especially for an ensemble of the instruments.

Flood-resilient housing

Mad(e) in Mumbai

Indian designer Mayuri Sisodia has proposed a new form of low-cost housing that helps mitigate the dangers of seasonal flooding in Sonbarsa, a village in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

Made from brick, bamboo and terracotta, the dwellings are comparatively cheap and easy to assemble. They are arranged into residential plots dubbed ""aqueous communes,"" with each comprising a cluster of six interconnect homes.

The idea is aimed at the village's migrant communities, for whom flooding often brings the most danger and disruption. But unlike the stilted houses found in other low-lying areas, the design aims to maintain a relationship between the occupants and life at ground level, by attempting to ""make peace"" between land and water, according to the project description.

Urban farming kits

PriestmanGoode

The brainchild of London design consultancy PriestmanGoode, the Turf Growers Pack contains everything needed to start producing food on window ledges and other unused surfaces. The recycled cardboard packaging, which holds containers, markers and seed bombs, doubles up as a plant pot and is biodegradable.

This small-scale approach may not meet your household's food needs, but it forms part of a wider manifesto aiming to ""re-establish the lost connection between the production and consumption of food, and strong local communities.""

The wider Turf toolkit also proposes an app that connects like-minded growers, urban farmers and "" guerrilla gardeners,"" allowing them to trade excess produce and reduce waste.

Pop-up gardens

MuDD Architects/AirLab

Designed to improve mental health and well being during -- and after -- the pandemic, these pop-up miniature ecosystems attach to existing buildings, offering urban apartment-dwellers access to nature. Constructed using bamboo poles, the suspended gardens would, in theory, be cultivated by automated drones that spray seeds onto a 3D-knitted fabric.

The companies behind the concept, AirLab and MuDD Architects, say the relationship between garden and host would be symbiotic, comparing their pop-ups to epiphytes -- organisms that, unlike parasites, add to the health of the overall ecosystem when they attach themselves to larger plants.",
The 'fox eye' beauty trend continues to spread online. But critics insist it's racist,"Written by Alicia Lee, CNN

""Ching chong eyes!"" That's what elementary school kids used to call Sophie Wang. It was an insidious racist slur casually thrown around as they mocked her Asian ethnicity while pulling on the corner of their eyes. Upward for Japanese. To the side for Chinese. Downward for Korean.

Wang is now 17 and many years removed from the days when her Asian American identity was reduced to ""a single facial feature."" And yet, scrolling through social media posts in recent months has brought those memories flooding back thanks to a new beauty trend: ""fox eyes.""

On Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, people from all over the world have been posting videos and photos modeling the look -- using makeup and other tactics to emulate the lifted, so-called ""almond-shaped"" eyes of celebrities such as Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Megan Fox.

Fox-eye makeup tutorials show how to use a combination of eye shadow, eyeliner and fake eyelashes, to get a winged aesthetic. Tips include shaving off the tail end of eyebrows and redrawing them to appear straighter and angled upwards. Others have also suggested pulling hair back into a high ponytail or using tape to further lift the eyes. Accentuating eyes to appear slanted, or elongated in shape, creates a more sultry effect, according to some makeup artists creating the look.

But to Wang and other Asian Americans, the ""migraine pose"" that sometimes accompanies these images -- using one or two hands to pull the eyes up by the temples to exaggerate the result -- is far too similar to the action used to demean them in the past.

Emma Chamberlain, an influencer with 9.8 million followers on Instagram, was recently criticized for posting a picture that showed her striking this pose while sticking out her tongue.

Her fans rushed to defend her, commenting that those that felt offended were ""overreacting."" Chamberlain later deleted the picture and apologized , saying it wasn't her ""intention"" to pose in an ""insensitive way"" and that she was ""so sorry to those who were hurt by it.""

But the damage had already been done.

""They mock my eyes then say ching chong call me a dog eater and then call me a ch*nk. Like why would you think I'd be fine with Emma's post?"" one person tweeted . ""Obviously if she gets to do slant eyes whilst getting praised but it's my natural eye shape and I'm getting discriminated (of course) I'm mad.""

""It's a new trend that brings out old stereotypes and old taunts,"" Wang said in a phone interview. ""Because it makes people like me feel uncomfortable and (to) some degree annoyed, it's time to talk about it.""

What people don't understand, Wang wrote in an op-ed for student-run newspaper Stanford Daily in July, is that the gesture has ""racially-charged historical weight,"" referring to past satirical depictions of Asians in Western media -- caricatures poking fun at facial features to portray them as ""barbaric,"" ""subhuman"" and inferior.

""Yet in the 21st century, these Asian features have suddenly transformed into beauty trends for non-Asian people,"" she wrote, adding that the trend is an act of cultural appropriation.

Appropriating Asian eyes

Kelly H. Chong, a sociology professor at the University of Kansas, defines cultural appropriation as the adoption, often unacknowledged or inappropriate, of the ideas, practices, customs and cultural identity markers of one group by members of another group whom have greater privilege or power.

""The cultural influencers from the dominant group legitimize it as a cool, style 'trend,' and in the process exoticizes and eroticizes it,"" Chong added in an e-mail interview. Even the term ""almond eyes,"" she says, which is being used to describe the shape of fox eyes, has long been used to describe the shape of Asian eyes.

She points to Hollywood's uncomfortable past in the appropriating the shape of Asian eyes. In the early 1930s, makeup artist Cecil Holland used techniques -- some, similar to creating fox eyes today -- to transform White actors into villainous Asian characters, like Fu Manchu. And Mickey Rooney, the White actor playing the part of Holly Golightly's thickly-accented Japanese neighbor in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" cemented ""the buck-toothed, slit-eyed Asian man look"" in the popular imagination.

TikTok user @LeahMelle, whose video denouncing the fox-eye look went viral, said she couldn't believe that such a trend could be so popular nowadays.

""This wasn't some dated movie where you could blame the distorted norms of the time period. This was happening now. And it was still viewed as acceptable,"" she wrote in an email.

Like most beauty trends, the craze for fox eyes will eventually subside, and has begun to already since it first came about earlier this year. But that's exactly the problem, according to Stephanie Hu, founder of Dear Asian Youth, a California-based organization that encourages Asian activism.

In an Instagram post , entitled ""The problem with the #FoxEye trend,"" the organization wrote, ""While it may not have originated from a place of ill-intent, it appropriates our eyes and is ignorant of past racism.""

""It really feels like this is a temporary trend,"" Hu said, adding that she believes Asians' eye shapes aren't just something to be casually adopted and then ""given back"" when the trend is over.

""Our eyes are something that we have to live with every day,"" Hu said in a phone interview.

Pressure to assimilate

Many Asians have long felt the pressure to alter the shape of their eyes, and to make them appear larger.

Blepharoplasty is used to create double eyelids, or a supratarsal eyelid crease. It's one of the most common cosmetic procedures in East Asian countries, as well as among Asian Americans. But when it was first popularized, in the early 1950s, it was used as a tool for Korean women to assimilate in the US.

According to The Korea Herald , American military plastic surgeon Dr. David Ralph Millard first performed the surgery during the Korean War. His first patients were Korean war brides who had married American soldiers. Because the brides were considered ""both cultural and racial threats to the US,"" the paper wrote, many of them would get the surgery in an effort to assimilate and appear ""less threatening.""

""Surgically altering the 'slanted' eyes became a mark of a 'good' and trustworthy Asian, one whose modification of the face provided a comforting illustration of the pliable Asian, and served as evidence of the US as the model and Asia as the mimic,"" wrote Taeyon Kim, then a PhD student at Bowling Green State University, in her 2005 dissertation, which is quoted in the article.

""While it is primarily beauty that motivates (today's women's) desire to alter their eyes, this beauty is built on a legacy of history of Western science and race that privileged the white body as the normal, beautiful body,"" Kim wrote.

That pressure to assimilate has carried to recent decades. In 2013, TV personality and news anchor Julie Chen, revealed on ""The Talk"" that she had blepharoplasty done as a 25-year-old, to get ahead in her career. A former boss had told her that ""Asian eyes"" made her look ""disinterested"" and ""bored.""

After surgery, Chen said, ""I did look better, at least by societal standards,"" in a 2016 op-ed for Glamour.

When social trends go viral

What is deemed attractive these days is significantly influenced by social media, where beauty trends can quickly go viral, and arguably just as quickly become destructive to a person's confidence and self worth.

On Tiktok, the hashtag #foxeye has already accumulated 72.8 million views, while on Instagram, the hashtag #foxeyes has more than 70,000 posts.

Asian American makeup artist Marc Reagan said when he first spotted the fox eye trend, he didn't think it was problematic. He simply saw it as a set of makeup techniques to enhance the eyes and to exaggerate an almond shape.

But it ""morphed into something different,"" he said, noting that it became offensive when people started adding the gesture of pulling up at the temples.

""I absolutely think that everyone needs to pause before they take (that) action,"" Reagan said in a phone interview. ""Everyone needs to pause, take a step back: 'Is this something that could be interpreted the wrong way?' 'Am I taking it down the path where it turns from being a simple makeup trend into appropriation?'""

Reagan added he isn't surprised that some people are feeling hurt by the trend, especially in light of the pandemic, when East Asians have been increasingly targeted with racist attacks or slurs . Some people, including the US president have referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"" or ""kung flu .""

""You can't be surprised that someone's going to be offended by you exaggerating a feature on your face that mimics something that they've been made fun of or discriminated against for. So we are (living) in a really sensitive time and those types of things need to be taken (into consideration) every single day.""

Oscar-tipped film 'Mank' is bathed in Old Hollywood glamour,"Written by Tufayel Ahmed, CNN

When director David Fincher enlisted his frequent collaborator, costume designer Trish Summerville, for his new movie ""Mank""-- a biopic on the screenwriter behind the iconic 1941 film ""Citizen Kane"" -- she knew it was going to be her most challenging assignment for him to date.

Summerville, who previously worked with Fincher on the crime thrillers ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" from 2011 and ""Gone Girl"" from 2014, was tasked with recreating the glamor of 1930s Hollywood, from its backlot meetings to its lavish soirees, without using a drop of color.

Fincher and cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt strove for authenticity of the era by closely replicating the look and feel of Old Hollywood talking pictures -- right down to shooting ""Mank"" entirely in black and white, or ""Fincher-vision,"" as Summerville described it over the phone.

""It's never going to be just black-and-white. It's his vision of what black-and-white is,"" she said of the film, which takes on sumptuous noir tones and unfolds in arresting continuous shots.

""Mank,"" which opened to a limited run in theaters in November and is out on Netflix today, is equally as buzzy a project as Summerville and Fincher's previous collaborations. ""Citizen Kane"" is considered one of the greatest movies of all time, and the film delves into the events and people screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (played by Gary Oldman) supposedly drew inspiration from while writing the script. ""Mank"" features some of the biggest stars of the era including ""Kane"" director Orson Welles (Tom Burke) and Hollywood starlet Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried).

Vibrancy without color

As Hollywood enters awards season, ""Mank"" is being tipped as an early favorite for next year's Oscars. Some of the praise is down to Summerville's costumes.

She not only had to ensure that all of the costumes accurately reflected the show-stopping gowns worn by the likes of Davies and actress Bette Davis, but that they dazzled even in black-and-white. Ironically, Summerville had to think more about color than ever before.

""Even if it is black-and-white, you can't just use just black and just white because it goes really flat (on screen) and everything looks the same,"" she explained. ""It was about figuring out which colors and varying tones read really well on screen.""

Summerville tried to stay ""authentic to what the color palette was then,"" she said, opting for both muted tones and jewel tones, which she said achieved a ""variance of white to off-white to gray to black-and-whites that would read differently.""

On set, there was a vibrant range of hues, particularly when it came to party scenes at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California, where Davies and her newspaper tycoon paramour William Randolph Hearst (played by Charles Dance) held famous soirees for Hollywood's biggest stars.

""A lot of the dresses and gowns are really intense colors like chartreuse, salmon and acidy greens and mangos,"" said Summerville.

The use of bold colors presented a conundrum in itself. Summerville had to be mindful that the colors used didn't distract the actors on set and appeased Fincher's sensibilities, too. ""Dave isn't a big fan of color,"" Summerville said. ""There's certain colors he doesn't like because they can draw your eye (away from the scene)."" The director doesn't like red, for instance, she said, but red can create a rich black on camera, while pinks can sub in for gray.

Another challenge, she said, was avoiding loud prints and patterns that can look ""confetti-like"" on screen. ""We didn't want everything to be solid because there was a lot of printing happening in women's clothing and men's ties at the time, so we tried to find tonally what was complimentary in black-and-white.""

Old Hollywood details

Befitting a movie star of Davies' fame and wealth, Seyfried wears some of the most elaborate costumes in ""Mank."" ""She's one of the few women that repeats throughout (the movie) and is in these big party scenes holding her own in political conversations,"" said Summerville. ""I wanted your eye to be drawn to her because it's such a male-heavy film.""

In one scene Seyfried wears a stunning gold, metallic lamé dress -- a popular material for women's gowns and evening at the time -- and later she is seen in a circus-inspired costume with palazzo-style pants at an annual party held at Hearst Castle. Summerville replicated the outfit Davies actually wore to the A-list soiree she and Hearst threw in 1937, based on photos of the actress there on a carousel horse.

""We just made slight improvements on it, like adding more rhinestones and Swarovski crystals down the front,"" said Summerville. ""I really wanted her to wear the pants ... There's other pictures where Marion did wear pants quite often, which was rare for a woman of her age and in that time period, and because she was around William Hearst, who was very traditional and old-fashioned.""

Differentiating the various men in the film was more difficult. Mank and his cohorts wore very traditional tailoring for the time, so Summerville infused a little bit of each character into their style. In the film, Oldman, for example, appears quite disheveled and showing signs of a paunchy stomach from excessive drinking.

Summerville gave authenticity to her designs by looking at the details of 1930s styles and the different techniques used to make the garments. Credit: Netflix

""His shirts weren't perfectly pressed -- they probably started off pressed in the morning, but as his day progressed he became more disheveled,"" explained Summerville. ""He wears his tie loosened a lot, which wasn't very common then, and we had his pants underneath his belly to show his weight gain.""

Summerville's foray into 1930s fashion gave the costume designer a sense of the workmanship that went into dressmaking and tailoring at the time. ""I really loved looking at old, authentic period clothing -- the sleeves on a lot of women's clothing were really intricate,"" she said. ""And how pockets and waistbands were sewn into men's trousers used different techniques that aren't done now at all. Clothing then was made with a lot of pride and quality put into it.""

The costume designer also took away from ""Mank"" a deeper appreciation for the laborious work her costume department peers would have done in 1930s Hollywood.

""The(re's) intricacy in the fabrics and the stoning that went into things,"" she said. ""And it was made head to toe, from milliners to cobblers.""",
"After fighting cancer, Tracey Emin returns to the art world with raw, emotional works","Written by Nick Glass, CNN

Tracey Emin is utterly fearless. Just months after undergoing extensive surgery to treat an aggressive bladder cancer, the famed British artist, who has been remarkably candid about the entire ordeal, has two new shows in London. And in line with her highly personal -- and often controversial -- art practice, her dual exhibition with Expressionist painter Edvard Munch is one of naked bodies, gestural brushstrokes and raw emotions.

Emin has been mad about Munch for 40 years. She and her artistic hero were born a century apart -- he in 1863, she in 1963 -- but their works appear together in ""The Loneliness of the Soul,"" at London's Royal Academy of Arts.

Tracey Emin returns to art after cancer treatment

Featuring 19 oils and watercolors by him and some 25 works by her -- a mix of paintings, neon and sculpture -- both bodies of work explore profound grief and loss. Emin was responsible for selecting which Munch works to display alongside her own, and she chooses many of his canvases featuring women to accompany her own autobiographical works.

At the same time, Emin's second new show, at London's White Cube gallery, includes a short Super-8 film from 1998 in tribute to the Expressionist painter, titled ""Homage to Edvard Munch and All My Dead Children."" In it, Emin crouches naked on a pier by the sea and lets out a prolonged and nerve-jangling scream. Of course, Munch's most famous work is ""The Scream"" -- he painted a total of four versions between 1893 and 1910. One sold at auction in 2012 for almost $120 million. Emin regards Munch as ""absolutely timeless,"" she said when I interviewed her, dealing with ""love, passion, jealousy, fear and death -- everything all of us have to live through.""

""It was like something out of a really bad black-humored film.""

Emin has had a lot to live through these past few months. Over the summer, the brutal diagnosis she received was all too familiar -- squamous-cell bladder cancer was the same type that killed her mother in 2016.

The artist was alone in her studio when the doctor phoned her with the result. ""I laughed. I laughed. I was shocked,"" she said of her initial reaction. ""There was a good chance I wasn't going to make it. It was all reliant on the surgery. I had a fantastic surgeon luckily enough,"" she said.

Emin underwent a six-and-a-half-hour operation in July. She has never been reticent about personal details: the team of 12 surgeons removed her bladder, urethra, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, part of her colon and part of her vagina. But the crucial news was that the cancer hadn't spread to her lymph nodes. Her ordeal and her willingness to talk about it propelled her onto the front page of newspapers while cancer charities have praised her for talking so frankly about it all.

""I have had a lot of horrible things happen to me in my life and they have put me in good stead for this moment,"" she said. ""I have my sense of humor. I have my will to live and survive."" She says without hesitation that she's not afraid of death, and then she cheerfully tells an anecdote about her new colostomy bag.

Initially, she had fiercely resisted the idea. She asked her surgeon if there was another option. ""And he goes, 'Yeah,''' she recalled. ""And I went, 'What is it? I'll do that.' And he said: 'It's death!' And I went: ''I'll take the bag!'"" She laughed. ""I couldn't believe it. It was like something out of a really bad black-humored film."" For the foreseeable future, Tracey will have scans every few months.

Emin has always been a divisive figure, her art and persona prompting strong reactions. She feels that back in the 1990s, the critics were both unfair and sexist. ""I was just considered to be a loud-mouthed screaming girl, a woman with big tits and no brain,"" she told writer and curator Kenny Schachter in a video interview last month. But over time, her career has gone from strength to strength. Her best-known piece, ""My Bed"" from 1998 -- an installation of a box-framed bed with rumpled, stained sheets, discarded condoms, empty vodka bottles and cigarette packs -- sold at auction in 2014 for $3.77 million.

""(I have a) really hard time when my shows open because people aren't always that kind to me,"" she said. She's hoping that given ""the cancer thing,"" that this time, they won't ""pick on me so much.""

A whirlwind of emotion

Emin's openness about her life has always been reflected in her artwork. In ""The Loneliness of the Soul,"" what is obviously shared between her and Munch is their common intensity and the confessional nature of their art.

Munch's paintings like ""Consolation,"" and ""Weeping Women"" show the figures of women bent over with emotion in small, intimate compositions.

Her paintings are bigger than his -- some 9 feet by 6 feet -- and her acrylic palate much sparer in red, pink, blue and black. She paints herself, nude, legs spread wide, sometimes bleeding. Lovers grapple during sex. Collectively, there is a sense of love and loss and abandonment.

In Emin's ""My Bed"" (1998), empty alcohol bottles, cigarettes, stained sheets and worn underwear are scattered on and around the bed. According to Emin the bed was in the same state as it had been in her own bedroom while she was battling with depression. Credit: Courtesy of the Saatchi Gallery, London

And as with Munch, her titles are important, like with ""I never Asked to Fall in Love - You made me Feel like This"" from 2018. The painting is made in splashes, flurries and drips of red and pink. In ""The Last of My Kind,"" from 2019, a naked female figure faces the viewer, face blurred, hemmed in by a scrawl of words. Part of it reads: ""I think I am trapped until I die. I am getting old now but not as old as my broken f*cked up vagina...I am the Last of my Kind.""

There is unquestionably a sense of exorcism in Emin's art. When she's painting, ""the emotion that comes out of me is like a whirlwind, like a tornado,'"" she described to Schachter.

""I am The Last of my Kind,"" (2019) and ""You Came,"" (2018) at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. Credit: David Parry

I asked her to describe her process. ""If you were in my studio and I was about to paint, you'd probably see me procrastinating for about two or three hours, fall asleep, muck around, everything but painting,"" she said. ""But then you'd see me get up and throw myself at the canvas and just within two seconds, like shock you. I just do a big drawing. I'd throw lots of paint at it. I'd attack it like a sort of banshee, definitely out of control. I love it. It's like having the best sex in the world.""

Next summer, an expanded version of the Emin/Munch show will open at the new Munch Museum in Oslo. It will include ""My Bed,"" her Super-8 homage to Munch and a huge new bronze sculpture, ""The Mother"" of a naked female figure, cradling ""an absent form,"" according to White Cube.

Emin is still convalescing and impatient for her energy to return, but is ""really looking forward to going crazy with a paint brush"" soon, she said. Munch died in Nazi-occupied Norway in 1944 at 80 years old. Emin says that she plans to live just as long, if not longer.",
"The untold story of Ann Lowe, the Black designer behind Jackie Kennedy's wedding dress","Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Written by

Some 800 guests saw the dress at the ceremony at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Newport, Rhode Island, and 400 more watched it glide through the reception that evening. And then there were the 3,000 well-wishers who broke through police barricades to witness Jacqueline Lee Bouvier's arrival at her wedding to then Sen. John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

A photo of the newlyweds ran on the front page of The New York Times on September 13, 1953. But the grainy black-and-white shot, the bride half obscured by her husband, couldn't do justice to the bouffant skirt and the layers of silk taffeta, the intricate scallop pintucks and tiny flowers of wax -- a fitting choice for the woman who would go on to become American royalty.

The gown, like those worn by Kennedy's bridesmaids, was the work of African American designer Ann Lowe, who died in February 1981.

""That dress she made for Jackie Kennedy was widely photographed. A lot of people saw it and it no doubt influenced average American wedding dresses and ball gowns,"" said Elizabeth Way, an assistant curator at The Museum at FIT. ""The fact that (the dress) came from the creativity of a Black woman really speaks to how instrumental Black people have been in shaping American culture.""

'Society's best kept secret'

And while the dress delighted the American public, the same cannot be said for the bride's own reaction. According to fashion historian Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell, who is the author of the recently released book ""The Way We Wed: A Global History of Wedding Fashion,"" Kennedy was no fan of the dress she wore to walk down the aisle.

""Even though it's a beautiful dress, it was not what she wanted, and she actually compared it to a lampshade,"" Chrisman-Campbell explained. ""It was chosen by her father-in-law-to-be, who wanted to create an American royalty moment and really set up his son as the heir to the family dynasty.""

At that point, Lowe was an established arbiter of American high-society style, delighting wealthy clients across the country (including Jaqueline's mother, Janet Lee Auchincloss, who commissioned Lowe to create her daughter's debutante and wedding dresses) with made-to-order princess silhouettes and couture-level embellishments. Years later, The Saturday Evening Post described her as ""society's best kept secret"" and ""unfamiliar except to the very rich.""

An unrepentant snob, Lowe was selective about her clients. Only the most elite were deserving of her efforts -- the Rockefellers and the du Ponts of the world, as well as stars like Olivia de Havilland, who wore one of Lowe's hand-painted floral designs the night she won best actress at the 1947 Academy Awards.

""I love my clothes and I'm particular about who wears them,"" Lowe said in an interview with Ebony magazine. ""I'm not interested in sewing for cafe society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for the families of the Social Register.""

To cater to her clientele, there was seemingly nothing she wouldn't do. After a flood in her Manhattan studio destroyed the Kennedy dresses just 10 days before the ceremony, she and her team worked day and night to ensure a new set was completed on time. She never mentioned a word of it to the family, and absorbed the additional costs herself.

How the most expensive clothes in the world get made

Inherited excellence

Ann Lowe was born in Clayton, Alabama, in 1898. Her grandmother, who had been born into slavery, and her mother ran an exclusive dressmaking business for wealthy patrons, and Lowe learned their craft from a young age.

""She had been working in dressmaking since she was a little girl, so she really had decades of experience by the time we get to the making of these ballgowns, these wedding gowns, these debutante gowns in the 1950s,"" Way said.

At 16, Lowe took over the family business after the death of her mother. She later studied design in New York, segregated from her White peers (she graduated after only six months because of her exceptional abilities) before setting up shop in Florida, where she built her reputation for extravagance and exclusivity. After a decade, she returned to Manhattan to do the same on the East Coast.

But the extreme wealth of the clients she so cherished wasn't enough to buoy her business. They would routinely talk her into lowering her prices, and she would often end up losing money from commissions. In 1963, she declared bankruptcy. (A longstanding rumor suggests Kennedy might have anonymously paid off her debts to the IRS.) By the time she retired in 1972, she was penniless.

""She does the same amazing kind of job that Mainbocher does,"" fashion columnist Eugenia Sheppard once remarked, referring to Main Rousseau Bocher, Lowe's contemporary and the first American couturier. ""The difference is that Mainbocher is a businessman as well as a designer, and he charges what he has to, to stay in business.""

Rediscovering a fashion legacy

Since her death, the name Ann Lowe has meant little outside of fashion history circles. But in recent years, there has been a sharp increase in interest around the designer. Both an Ann Lowe biography and an Ann Lowe children's book have been published, and a historical fiction novel, by Piper Huguley, is in the works. Her designs have been exhibited at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and as part of FIT's 2017 exhibition ""Black Fashion Designers.""

Lowe's skill and success in a field where Black women are still routinely erased and excluded disrupts prevailing narratives about not just fashion industry, but American history.

""With all the political movements happening right now, that have been building over the last century, people are interested in the history of Black artists and Black creatives in so many industries, and it's great to know that (Black people's participation in fashion) didn't start in the beginning of the 2000s,"" Way said. ""Black designers have always been working in the industry. There is a legacy there.""",
People are calling for museums to be abolished. Can whitewashed American history be rewritten?,"Written by Brian Boucher, CNN

After years of resisting calls for its removal, New York's American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) has asked the city to dislodge from its front steps an equestrian monument to Theodore Roosevelt, the twenty-sixth US president, which depicts him charging forward, and towering over two mostly nude figures, one Black and one Indigenous.

In a statement dated June 2020 sent to museum staff, posted on the museum's website, Ellen Futter, president of the institution's board, said, ""As we strive to advance our institution's, our City's, and our country's passionate quest for racial justice, we believe that removing the statue will be a symbol of progress and of our commitment to build and sustain an inclusive and equitable Museum community and broader society."" (After the announcement President Donald Trump tweeted, ""Ridiculous, don't do it!"")

Might this concession be a harbinger of other changes ahead for American museums? How can institutions whose leadership is often overwhelmingly White rethink their staffing, collections and exhibitions, much less move toward more truly equitable governance? Or, some ask, should museums continue to exist in anything like their current form?

The Natural History Museum's statement places the monument's removal in the context of ""the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd,"" a Black man who was killed by four police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, one of whom knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. After a video of Floyd's killing went viral, tens of thousands took to the streets in protest in the US and around the world, even in the midst of a pandemic, to demand accountability for police brutality and to call for the defunding, or even the abolition of local police forces, among other demands.

The presence of an Indigenous figure in the Roosevelt monument, and the museum itself, have a very personal meaning for Wendy Red Star, an artist and member of the Crow tribe. She created a project, ""The 1880 Crow Peace Delegation,"" about a group of Crow chiefs who traveled to Washington, DC, that year to try to negotiate a peace treaty. In researching for the project, she found that the remains of one of those chiefs, Pretty Eagle, had been stolen from a burial site and later sold to the AMNH. The tribe was able to repatriate the remains in the 1990s.

""It wasn't until I did this project that I learned about that,"" Red Star said in a phone interview. ""The Roosevelt monument was the first thing I thought of. To me, it's a really direct connection to how my people have been presented at the museum -- along with the dinosaur bones as part of the natural world. It's always been such a surreal experience to see my community's objects on display and watch people observing them as if these were peoples of the past.""

Just as government, law enforcement, and all forms of authority are being questioned in this moment of upheaval, museums worldwide have come in for intense scrutiny, and the situation on the ground is changing very fast. Earlier this month, dozens of current and former staffers of multiple cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art as well as institutions nationwide, published an open letter accusing the institutions of unfair treatment of employees of color and saying that ""your covert and overt white supremacy that has benefited the institution, through the unrecognized dedication and hard labor of Black/Brown employees, with the expectation that we remain complacent with the status quo, is over.""

Within days, staffers at the Guggenheim and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art openly accused the institutions' leadership of racism. In an emailed statement to CNN, Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation, said the institution was prepared to address these concerns:

""As a society, we are confronting sustained injustices never resolved, and feel today the pain and anger of previous moments of turmoil. The Guggenheim addresses the shared need of great reform, and long overdue equality, and want to reaffirm that we are dedicated to doing our part.

""In this period of self-reflection and reckoning, we will engage in dialogue with our staff and review all processes and procedures to lead to positive change,"" he continued. ""We are expediting our ongoing ... efforts to produce an action plan for demonstrable progress.""

The Metropolitan Museum declined to comment. The Museum of Modern Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art did not respond to requests for comment.

Museums have also been critiqued for issuing anodyne statements that failed to mention Floyd or the Black Lives Matter movement. The Getty Museum, in Los Angeles, posted an unspecific call for ""equity and fairness"" on Instagram, and later apologized ; the director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art privately apologized to Black artist Glenn Ligon for using a work of his from the museum's holdings on social media without his permission, according to the New York Times.

The AMNH's statement does not mention the groups that have for several years organized protests calling for the Roosevelt monument's removal. In a phone interview, Decolonize This Place (DTP) organizer Amin Husain pointed out that removal of the monument was just one of three demands that Decolonize had placed on the museum, which include internally renaming Columbus Day as Indigenous People's Day and rethinking the museum's displays.

""Many of the museum's galleries contain Indigenous remains and objects,"" he said. ""Those things need to be sent back to the people they were taken from, and the exhibitions must be completely overhauled in consultation with, and with the active participation of, the relevant stakeholders.""

While many U.S. museums have made moves toward what the field calls ""diversity, equity, and inclusion,"" fellow DTP organizer Marz Saffore called for much greater change. ""It's critical that we move past identity politics,"" she said. ""It's not enough to hire an Indigenous curator. It's not enough to have one Black person on your board. Museums as we know them have to be abolished. I don't want my voice to be added to museums that are often trophy cases for Imperialism.""

Institutions like the AMNH will continue to be sites for debate, some of which may echo heated arguments among historians and activists on how to handle monuments to objectionable historical figures. This includes leaders of the Confederate Army in the US Civil War, which were erected by Confederate sympathizers oftentimes decades after the war, with a conscious white supremacist purpose

Some ask whether these monuments could, rather than being destroyed or removed, be altered by, for example, adding contextualizing information. In an interview with National Public Radio on Tuesday about the Roosevelt monument, historian Manisha Sinha suggested that this tribute to Roosevelt's efforts toward nature conservation could still stand, if the subjugated Black and Indigenous figures were simply removed. (DTP pointed out in an emailed statement that the land Roosevelt ""conserved"" was stolen from Indigenous people, so they would hardly find that an acceptable solution.)

By contrast, Abraham Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer, former public affairs czar for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and author of books including ""Lincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion"" (2014), wrote an editorial this month for the New York Daily News saying that while he had earlier asked whether Confederate monuments could be altered, he'd concluded that they must be removed. ""I was not only wrong,"" he wrote; ""I was insensitive.""

Michael Diaz-Griffith, executive director of the New York-based Sir John Soane's Museum Foundation, which supports the Soane Museum in London, is author of ""The Anti-Racist Preservationist's Guide to Confederate Monuments: Their Past and a Future Without Them,"" a pamphlet that succinctly explains how such monuments have a foundation in white supremacy, and outlines why they should be struck from the public realm. ""In the case of the Confederates there's no public legacy to detach from their wrongdoing,"" Diaz-Griffith said over the phone.""The Confederacy was an immoral enterprise.""

Diaz-Griffith envisions a future, sooner or later, free of tributes to any such contentious figures.

""I think that all named buildings, all named places, will end up being reevaluated,"" he said. ""Who should they be named after? Do we continue to focus on those who were recognized in their own times, or do we shift our attention to those who fought for justice but weren't publicly honored when they were alive? Since all people are fallible, it may be a good idea to erect monuments to principles, like justice, rather than to individuals.""

US museums, dependent as they are on the largesse of wealthy individuals and families, are far from a future in which controversial donors, who, for instance, hold views that run counter to science, nonetheless have galleries or other features named for them. The AMNH itself was under scrutiny for taking money from Rebekah Mercer, a major donor to the Republican party, whose leader Donald Trump has repeatedly denied the existence of climate change during his time in office. Mercer left the board when her term ended in 2019. Meanwhile in 2014, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named the revamped plaza on Fifth Avenue for donor David H. Koch, likewise a Republican donor, who is notable for funding efforts to undercut climate change science.

But the activists who had called for the removal of the Roosevelt monument have more foundational questions in mind than who funds such cultural organizations. Representing the group NYC Stands with Standing Rock, Sandy Grande, using the Lenape people's name for Manhattan, said in a phone interview, ""We should underscore that the city (Mannahatta) wouldn't exist without the land and labor of Black and Indigenous peoples. This is Lenape land and the Mohawk and Seneca peoples built much of the city. In addition to Black people's labor, their settlement at Seneca Village was destroyed.""

""So,"" she said, ""the removal of the monument has been a long time coming, not just for the museum but for the city itself, and we will continue to press for change.""

""This is an historic moment -- a pause and reflect moment for individuals and institutions,"" said Makeba Clay, the chief diversity officer at the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, over email. ""The systemic and unrelenting injustices against members of the Black community have existed for hundreds of years and continue to exist all around us, including in our museums. We know we have work to do and that means being actively anti-racist -- not passively non-racist.""

Clay was the inaugural appointee to her role, which she took on in 2018 and her message is that it's not enough to ""amplify"" voices and messages, art institutions must take action. ""We are looking at our staff and board, both overwhelmingly white, and actively examining our hiring and recruitment processes to promote greater diversity,"" she said. ""We recently held a town hall, which uncovered stark differences between staff of color and white staff.""

Clay also said that art does not exist outside struggle. That while it can be used for ""constructive discourse, building empathy and creating community,"" art also ""can confront current issues and topics that aren't neutral.""

Adding: ""What appears like radical action is exactly what museums need to pursue to prove that they have a valuable role to play in this national discourse.""

"Germany's ex-royals want their riches back, but past ties to Hitler stand in the way","Written by Scott McLean, CNN Nadine Schmidt, CNN Baden-Württemberg, Germany

Perched on a steep hilltop in southern Germany, the striking turrets of Hohenzollern Castle rise in contrast to the rolling countryside that surrounds them. The fortress is the ancestral seat of Germany's last imperial family. If the country still had a monarchy today, the castle's owners would be its royal family , led by Georg Friedrich, whose ceremonial title is also his legal surname: Prince of Prussia.

Inside, the would-be Kaiser Prince Georg cranes his neck towards an ornate family tree painted on the wall behind him. He proudly describes his lineage, which traces back through centuries of kings and queens who ruled over Prussia (a once-vast area that included parts of modern-day Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Russia and Denmark) through German monarchs like his great-great-grandfather, the Kaiser who led the country into World War I.

But, along with the castle and the wealth, Prince Georg has also inherited a very public and, at times, ugly legal battle with authorities to reclaim a family fortune confiscated after the fall of the Nazis. According to Prince Georg, the vast collection of more than 10,000 items includes everything from priceless artworks to the opulent heirlooms of German history's most powerful and important family.

The case was first filed decades ago , but it has recently provoked ire and outrage among the German public, many of whom believe he's entitled to nothing at all. And some historians are skeptical of his claims.

""I see it as my duty,"" he tells CNN, in his first ever TV interview on the subject. ""I think my family would fully agree to pursue these claims, whether the judges will eventually judge in our favor or not.""

Watch now: Germany's ex-royals want their riches back

Standing between Prince Georg's family and a cache of untold monetary and cultural value is a broadly worded German law that disqualifies those who helped the Nazis into power from restitution or compensation for lost property. To understand today's legal wrangling, you have to go back more than a century into a grim chapter of German history.

In 1918, following defeat in World War I, the country ditched its royal family to become a republic and a democracy. The then-Kaiser and his family gave up their power but got to keep a substantial part of the fortune they'd amassed over the centuries: castles, land, artworks, crowns, swords and jewels. The ex-royals then went into exile in the Netherlands.

After World War II, Germany was divided into west and east, with the communist Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic taking control of the latter and seizing the property of ordinary citizens and ex-royals alike. The vast majority of the then-privately-owned German royal fortune fell on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. It would take almost half a century for the Berlin Wall to come down.

Shortly after, in the 1990s, a reunified Germany passed a law allowing anyone whose property was expropriated to reclaim it. Millions of ordinary families that had fled East Germany used the legislation to reclaim their homes . But the law came with a very specific catch: Those who ""substantially supported"" the Nazis were ineligible.

This all means that a complex legal claim being debated in 2020 hinges, ultimately, on the actions of one man in the 1930s: Prince Georg's great-grandfather (and the son of Germany's last Kaiser, Wilhelm II), Crown Prince Wilhelm.

The result has the potential to shift large portions of museum collections from public to private hands.

""A court decision brings with it the danger of a decision in favour of the House of Hohenzollern and, in the worst-case scenario, of the large-scale removal of objects from the collections of cultural institutions,"" a spokesperson for the German Ministry of Culture told CNN by email. ""An out-of-court settlement, by contrast, would likely make it possible to avoid lengthy court proceedings and would provide a viable foundation for cooperation between the House of Hohenzollern and the affected cultural institutions.""

Asked if Prince Georg's claims are justified, a spokesperson for the Berlin Senate Department of Culture told CNN in an email, ""The political answer is no. From a legal point of view, things can look different. That is the only reason for the talks.""

And beyond the historical treasures at stake, the case ultimately gives rise to a question German society has long grappled with: how to judge the sins of your ancestors.

A uncomfortable family photo

At Hohenzollern Castle, Prince Georg is shown a photo he's seen before: It's his great grandfather Crown Prince Wilhelm, in 1933, dressed in a military uniform and a Nazi armband. He's standing above a large swastika at a rally of 80,000 members of the SA , a Nazi paramilitary group. By this time, Wilhelm had returned from exile on the condition that he wouldn't involve himself in politics -- a promise he apparently couldn't keep.

""It's very hard to look at,"" Prince Georg says. ""These pictures are very strong. Especially when you see the swastika on his arm. It always makes your breath stop, and you ask yourself, 'Why is he wearing that?'""

In the 1930s, Communism was a rising force around the world and the Great Depression had plunged people into poverty, drawing many Germans towards Adolf Hitler's nationalist agenda. Germany had been a fragile democracy for barely a decade when Hitler was elected Chancellor in 1933, the year Wilhelm was photographed in the Nazi armband. There are other photos like it, including one of the Crown Prince locked in a momentary gaze with a grinning Hitler.

Prince Georg says his great-grandfather may have been wearing a swastika, but his primary motivation was to return the monarchy to power -- and he believed Hitler could make that happen. The Nazi leader may have even entertained the possibility. A British newspaper reported in 1932 that he was secretly plotting, upon his election, to tear up the newly-enshrined democratic constitution and form a government ""with the ex-Crown Prince at its head.""

""The Crown Prince was driven by the idea of getting back monarchy or getting back to the throne,"" Prince Georg says of his great-grandfather. ""But he was also misled by the idea that it might be a better to appease the Nazis, at least at the beginning.""

This is a disempowered former prince. He was not widely respected. He was a playboy. Chris Clark, historian

It soon became clear that Hitler had no plans to hand over power to anyone. The Daily Mirror reported the Crown Prince was ""disappointed at Hitler's changed attitude towards the monarchy,"" though he continued publicly supporting him nonetheless.

""He thought that it might help to keep the (Nazis) in control and lead them (down a different path), which might be more fortunate for our country,"" Prince Georg said. ""And judging from now, this was a horrible misconception.""

Rather than enabling Hitler's rise, Wilhelm and the ex-royal family was, according to Prince Georg's reading, ""seen as a constant threat"" due to their ongoing popularity with some segments of the public. Proof of this, he says, can be seen in 1940, when tens of thousands of people took to Potsdam's streets to mourn the death of the Crown Prince's son. Or in 1944, when Hitler's secretary recalled that, following a failed attempt on his life, Hitler said, ""believe me, it will come out that the real instigator is the Crown Prince!"" He wasn't, and Hitler's paranoia is well documented. But Hitler's suspicion proves he saw the Crown Prince as a threat, not an ally, Prince Georg says.

""He was in a very difficult position because...If he had shown more opposition -- which he is now blamed for not doing -- I have no idea whether I would be sitting here,"" he says, explaining that a distant uncle was sent to a concentration camp for doing just that.

Yet, Prince Georg also argues that Wilhelm had neither the power nor the clout to prevent the dictator's rise.

""By this time, the Crown Prince lacked the political influence to substantially contribute to the rise of the Nazi regime,"" said Prince Georg.

This was the very position taken by Chris Clark, an historian at Cambridge University's St Catharine's College, in a 2011 research paper commissioned by Prince Georg's family, the House of Hohenzollern.

""This is a disempowered former prince,"" Clark told CNN. ""He was not widely respected. He was a playboy... he liked the look of Hitler, he was quite sympathetic with the Nazi party, but he didn't actually become a card-carrying Nazi.

""(Crown Prince Wilhelm's) lack of political talent, his lack of a powerful network and his lack of an official position from which he could wield power meant that, as much as he might want to help Hitler, his help wasn't especially effective.""

That didn't stop the Crown Prince from trying. In a New York newspaper column published in 1933, Wilhelm praised Hitler's ""clear-sighted and energetic leadership"" and blamed communists and Jews for Germany's tattered reputation.

In his paper, Clark concluded that although the Crown Prince undoubtedly supported Hitler, his support wasn't ""substantial."" In other words, the Hohenzollerns ought to be entitled to compensation.

Evolving historical evidence

Plenty of experts have disagreed with Clark -- hinting at the complexity of this longstanding legal battle. Now the Australian-British historian says he has changed his mind, citing newly-uncovered evidence showing that the Crown Prince had more public influence than originally thought.

""That's what happens in history,"" he says. ""We find out new stuff, we change our mind.""

This new evidence was unearthed by Stephan Malinowski, a historian at the University of Edinburgh whose research has concluded that the Crown Prince significantly contributed to the Nazi regime. Malinowski, who declined to be interviewed for this story, is one of four historians commissioned by the government and Prince Georg's family to investigate the relationship between Wilhelm and the Nazis.

CNN interviewed five additional historians for this story, four of whom now side with Malinowski, though most also agreed that neither side's case is iron-clad. Among them is John Rohl, who said that the Crown Prince had once bragged ""that he had actually transposed 2 million votes to Hitler,"" and Stephanie Middendorf, who argues that he helped make the Nazis more palatable to the upper-class elites he rubbed shoulders with.

But there are others who support Clark's original position -- historians like Wolfram Pyta, whose 155-page research paper, also commissioned by the House of Hohenzollern, concluded that the Crown Prince ""actively rejected the Nazi system."" Or, independent historian Benjamin Hasselhorn, who told CNN that the Crown Prince ""did provide support [to the Nazis] but not substantial support.""

The 1994 compensation law effectively ensures that the German government isn't forced to compensate industrial giants -- like Volkswagen and BMW -- who supported the Nazis' rise to power and relied on forced labor from concentration camps, to build cars during WWII. Both companies have acknowledged their historic responsibility and paid compensation to victims.

But the law's intent is unclear when it comes to former royals. In the 1800s, before Germany was a country, the region was comprised of many smaller kingdoms, each with their own royal, or noble, families. Some of them have already quietly secured restitution for property and land lost during communist rule in East Germany, like Michael-Benedikt Prince von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach, who in 2003 dropped his claims for restitution of art works, manuscripts and the inventory of the Wartburg Castle near Eisenach, in return for €15.5 million ($18.2 million).

Cultural collateral

According to Prince Georg, the thousands of items on the line range from a simple coffee spoon to centuries-old works of art. Items that ended up outside Germany or were otherwise lost also form part of the negotiations, in case they eventually re-surface. His family is also seeking cash compensation of €1.2 million ($1.4 million), which represents the value of their land at the time it was seized.

According to the Prince's spokesperson, ""It is safe to assume that the current value of the family ́s private property taken by the communists is several hundred times higher."" Berlin state authorities meanwhile told CNN that the overall value of the Hohenzollerns' claim is ""high, but not quantifiable.""

There is no longer any property at stake, though the Prince recently settled his claim for the ancient Rheinfels Castle on the condition that the charity run by his wife receives a portion of ticket sales.

This debate really belongs in the public and it cannot, and should not, be suffocated by legal action. Eckart Conze, historian

Complicating matters for the German government is the fact that Prince Georg is also the largest lender of art to cultural institutions in the German states of Berlin and Brandenburg (both facing legal claims along with the federal government) including the many paintings, furniture and other items on display at Charlottenburg Palace. He owns the crowns of the first Prussian King and Queen, which are displayed alongside an orb and scepter that he's seeking to have returned. He also owns the jewel-encrusted tobacco boxes that once belonged to Frederick the Great, the longest serving Prussian King.

The Prince says he's committed to keeping the disputed items on public display, regardless of whether they eventually change hands. ""I really strongly feel this cultural responsibility to contribute something to the country and to show these items to the public,"" he says. ""Actually, we are on the same side as the government.""

He insists his claim is not about money.

""If it was that easy, I think my ancestors would have sold this place, the Castle Hohenzollern... and we would have sold our (remaining) art collection, which we lend to Berlin and to Brandenburg"" he said. ""It's not as simple as just taking a check.""

Yet, he may face an uphill battle convincing a skeptical German public of his charitable motivations. And while the case has been quietly ongoing for decades, it has recently become a matter of public interest, thanks in part to Jan Böhmermann, host of a satirical program akin to ""The Daily Show.""

In the half-hour segment, the late-night comedian roasted Prince Georg for having the ""balls of steel"" to bring his demands to court. The comedian also dismissed his claims as outrageous and hypocritical, given that genocide victims in Germany's former colonies under the royals' rule were never compensated.

High-profile clashes

Prince Georg has also been criticized for his public handling of the case. His legal team has filed at least 30 warning letters and lawsuits, primarily targeting historians and journalists, since the case became public. Historian Eckart Conze says he was served with a lawsuit after criticizing the Prince for serving too many lawsuits. Specifically, he says the Prince's lawyers took aim at his claims that the legal threats were an attempt to ""suffocate an important and necessary public debate.""

Conze says he had a choice: refrain from making similar statements or prepare for a legal fight. The historian chose the latter and is awaiting his day in court, though many of his colleagues have kept quiet because they can't afford to do the same, he says. A German non-profit called the Open Knowledge Foundation is currently crowdfunding for the legal defense of journalists and historians who say that they have been threatened by the Hohenzollerns' lawyers.

""This debate really belongs in the public and it cannot, and should not, be suffocated by legal action,"" Conze says.

Prince Georg insists that he's never sued over critical reporting, only false or defamatory statements.

""I think it is very important to have the freedom of the press, as it is part of our constitution. And it's also a pillar of our democracy. But lying is not, and that was the only thing we tried to straighten.""

Asked if he regrets his public handling of the case, he says, ""We could have been better on that, yes.""

Negotiating positions

The would-be Kaiser -- who is also 202nd in line to the British throne according to royalty expert Marlene Koenig -- says he hasn't sought out attention, but the legal wrangling has made it impossible to avoid. When he first took over as head of the House of Hohenzollern at age 18, he initially wondered if he wanted the responsibility at all. But his grandfather asked him to continue the restitution case, he says, a promise that still motivates him today.

""I feel obliged to fulfill his last will because he also wrote very explicitly in his testament that he expects me to follow his footsteps,"" he said.

An extended interview with Prince Georg

But this case is, now, much bigger than Prince Georg or his grandfather. Beyond the moral question of how the legal system ought to judge the transgressions of the Crown Prince, it encourages a broader national discussion in a country that is still reconciling the past. Germany is, after all, still putting accused Nazi war criminals on trial 75 years after the end of the World War II. By asking whether Crown Prince Wilhelm facilitated the Nazis' rise, Prince Georg also thinks Germans ought to ask who else was responsible. What about the millions who voted for them? Or the big businesses who supported them?

This is, Prince Georg says, a national debate that's yet to be resolved."" (Our claims) are not the reason for the discussion... I think we are kind of a symptom for the whole discussion -- or the discussion that needs to take place,"" he says, clearly hoping the historical debate won't distract from Germany's more recent legal traditions: to judge a case based on the law, not society's evolving moral standards. ""I'm very happy that I live in a constitutional state.""

For now, neither the prince nor the Brandenburg government appear willing to risk an all-or-nothing outcome by taking the case to court. Both sides recently agreed to delay court proceedings, which were due to begin in August, for another year to give them more time to reach a negotiated settlement.

Hong Kong's vast $3.8 billion rain-tunnel network,"The city's complex drainage system protects Hong Kong from once-disastrous flooding caused by seasonal typhoons. But will it be strong enough to withstand the effects of climate crisis?

Below the mountains that overlook Hong Kong's financial district, drainage engineer Alex Lau is ankle-deep in water flowing into a giant tunnel almost twice the height of a double-decker bus.

Part of a ground-breaking, $3.8 billion (30 billion Hong Kong dollar) drainage network, this tunnel runs nearly the length of Hong Kong Island and has saved the city from floods that decades ago routinely cost lives and caused widespread destruction.

""This tunnel intercepts about one third of the rainfall for the northern Hong Kong area,"" Lau says, as he looks west to the point where the tunnel fades to black. ""We have about 34 intakes and all the intercepted water will be diverted into the tunnel and carried all the way to the sea.""

Dug with two vast tunnel-boring machines over five years, beginning in 2007, the 10.5-kilometer-long (6.5 mile) tunnel, about half the length of Manhattan, has solved a basic but pressing problem facing one of Asia's wettest cities: rain. Hong Kong receives about 2,400 millimeters it per year, according to the Drainage Services Department (DSD). And about 80% of that water falls in just a few months.

But building this network in one of the world's densest cities wasn't easy.

Hong Kong Island was already criss-crossed by tunnels, carrying the city's subway system and accommodating roads that slice through the mountainous landscape.

Consequently, the Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel runs through the hills behind the city, tucked less than a dozen meters below the surface -- though few of the city's residents, whose lives it protects each rainy season, ever realize it is there.

Engineers had to shore up insecure ground above the tunnel to prevent water seeping through and causing parts of it to collapse. To tackle the difficulty of building tunnel intakes -- pipes and entrances leading to the main drain -- in dense urban areas, the decided to dig upwards from the tunnels and then extract gravel and debris that fell down out of the subterranean network to avoid causing too much disruption at street level.

Frequent flooding

A true Hong Kong summer can be a test of any resident's love for the city. Stiflingly hot and humid, from June to September, high temperatures are only broken by typhoons and rainstorms, during which the city endures torrential downpours that render umbrellas useless.

On June 7, 2008, more than 145 millimeters (5.7 inches) poured down on the city in 24 hours. That's more than what Seattle, Washington receives most months. Photos from the storm show people trudging through knee deep water, and at least two people were killed in landslides caused by the torrential downpour. Credit: MIKE CLARKE/AFP/AFP via Getty Images

Hong Kong has a color-coded warning system for rainstorms, from amber to black, issued by the Observatory and sent to millions of residents' mobile phones. Building on a system introduced in 1967 , the alerts warn people when to avoid unnecessary travel due to the danger of road accidents, or even landslides caused by rain in some mountainous parts of the city.

Offices and schools shut during black rain, which is defined as when more than 70 millimeters (2.7 inches) per hour. While black rain causes minor flooding -- mainly due to the impermeability of tarmac and concrete -- thanks to the giant underground tunnels, it is nothing compared to the past.

The deadliest typhoon hit the city in September 1906, killing an estimated 15,000 people, according to Hong Kong Observatory , 5% of the city's then population of 320,000. In the 1960s and 70s, Hong Kong suffered hundreds of fatalities due to tropical cyclones. Thousands also lost their homes due to flooding, and the city had to spend millions on water damage repairs every year.

Heavy urbanization only made flooding worse, as large areas of natural ground were paved over, swapping soluble grass and mud for concrete and tarmac, which rather than absorb rain, allowed water to accumulate in puddles or, worse, cause flood. Older areas of the city were also compromised, with drainage systems built for a far smaller population and to poor standards.

Since 1995, the department has spent around $3.8 billion on various projects. That has included installing 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) of drains, 360 kilometers (224 miles) of river channels, four vast underground tunnels spanning 21 kilometers (13 miles), and four stormwater storage tanks. Another 11 tanks are being constructed.

The Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel is the largest of four, and runs through the mountains above Tin Hau, in the eastern part of the island, past the busy financial districts of Admiralty and Central, to Cyberport on the western coast. At its widest, the tunnel is 7.25 meters in diameter.

It slopes gradually downward so the water is carried out by gravity, though pumps can also be engaged for heavy flow. Even on a dry day, water streams down a nearby intake from high above in the mountains. The intake looks like an artificial waterfall made of concrete steps designed to slow down the flow. Far from smelling like a drain, the water heading into the tunnel has little aroma, and looks a river.

Other solutions in Hong Kong are tailored to the district. So, rural villages and towns can be protected with dykes and channels dug to redirect or temporarily store the water, while heavily built-up, urban areas require more intensive engineering work.

These solutions, which direct rainwater away from vulnerable areas and eventually return it to the ocean, have helped to reduce the number of flooding blackspots from 126 in 1995, to just five today.

Richard Leung, the DSD's senior engineer, won't be drawn on whether all this has been value for money, but for context, flooding in southern China led to economic losses of more than $2.9 billion (20 billion RMB) in June alone

Racecourse storage

One of the largest storage tanks in Hong Kong lies beneath one of its best-known landmarks: the Happy Valley Racecourse, where, before coronavirus, tens of thousands of gamblers bet on weekly horse races. Hundreds more use the grounds as an outdoor running track, football pitch, and rugby field during the rest of the week.

""You would never know this was here from the outside,"" Lau says inside the tank. The concrete floor is streaked with mud and dotted with small puddles. Small stones, silt and leaves are partially lit by fluorescent lights that do little to illuminate the darkness.

The chamber looks like a vast, empty underground car park. At its fullest, it can hold up to 60,000 square meters of water, or the equivalent to 24 standard swimming pools.

It protects some of the most expensive real estate in the city from flooding, not least the racecourse itself, which prior to the tank's creation in 2012 was regularly inundated with rain, destroying the turf and requiring expensive repairs.

Happy Valley is also indicative of the DSD's future plans to recycle rainwater citywide. Some of the water that falls on the racecourse is collected and reused, for irrigation and to flush toilets in nearby housing estates.

Changing climate

The achievement of Hong Kong's anti-flood strategy cannot be overstated. Combined with the city's typhoon warning and protection systems -- such as storm surge barriers -- it has made weather that is disastrous in many other parts of southeast Asia a mere annoyance for most Hong Kongers.

Every year during the summer rains, storms that wash over Hong Kong, their deluge diverted by the tunnels and stored in tanks, can devastate parts of neighboring Guangdong by destroying buildings.

Hong Kong is not alone in dealing with flooding effectively, and the city's engineers regularly collaborate with international and regional partners to share best practices and solutions. That is becoming ever more important as the changing climate brings more unpredictable and dangerous weather.

After Typhoon Mangkhut battered the city in 2018, the Hong Kong Observatory's senior scientific officer Ping-Wah Li told CNN , ""rain from tropical cyclones will increase ... and sea levels will continue to rise, increasing the threat of storm surges and coastal inundations,"" due to global warming.

Edward Ng, professor of architecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that some work had been done to bolster Hong Kong defenses, but that ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" are needed to properly defend the coast.

""The design standard is based on past history,"" he said in a previous interview. ""It can cope with what happened thirty years ago, but not with what will happen in the next fifty years.""

Leung, the DSD senior engineer, is also wary of being caught out by complacency, saying the city's current defenses are sufficient only at present, and may be surpassed in the future.

As well as continuing with engineering works like building tanks and tunnels, he believes adjustments to the city's design and architecture can help combat the risks of climate change.

Those design solutions could include porous pavements, protected wetlands, rain gardens, and green rooftops, all of which can help absorb rainfall. So-called ""sponge cities"" have already been trialed in China , with some success.

Even as the climate crisis leads to rising sea levels and serious flooding in some parts of the world, it is also having a major effect on global water resources, with the number of countries dealing with extreme water crises growing.

Leung said that in cities like Hong Kong that are inundated with rainfall, there needs to be a reimagining of how to deal with water. Beyond just intercepting and diverting it, there should be more tactics for storing, purifying and reusing it, thus reducing the pressure on existing water resources.

At present, some rain is collected and reused for irrigation and flushing water, but most is still dumped back into the sea, a bitter situation for a city that imports over 70% of its fresh water from across the border in mainland China. With rising temperatures potentially leading to greater water-insecurity around the world, Hong Kong's ability to do more with the water that literally falls upon it is more important than ever.

""In the past, we just discharged, but now we're talking about using the water as much as possible,"" Leung said. ""We don't know exactly how it is changing, but we know the climate is changing, so we have to be prepared.""

"LEGO won't make modern war machines, but others are picking up the pieces","Brad Lendon , CNN Written by

This is a story about a multibillion-dollar international conglomerate, arms manufacturers, a German peace group and renegades who make miniaturized weapons systems out of small shops.

Not that those tiny weapons could actually hurt anyone. Well, not unless you stepped on one.

The conglomerate is LEGO, with worldwide revenues of $6.2 billion in 2019 from its toys, retail stores, theme parks and even movie rights. Its toy sets -- which are intended to ""inspire the builders of tomorrow,"" according to the company's mission statement -- run the gamut, from skyscrapers to boats, police stations to castles. There's even a kit to make Rome's famous Colosseum . Nothing from the real world, it seems, is off limits. That is, except for anything modeled on today's military.

""We have a long-standing policy of not creating sets which feature real military vehicles that are currently in use,"" Ryan Greenwood, a spokesman for the company, said in an email to CNN.

But during the summer, the Danish company released a set for the V-22 Osprey, a tiltrotor aircraft manufactured by Boeing and Bell Helicopter Textron that is only used by the American and Japanese militaries.

The kit, set to launch under LEGO's vehicle-focused Technic brand, depicted a search and rescue version of the Osprey. But it drew a quick, harsh protest from the German Peace Society -- United War Resisters (DFG-VK in German), an almost 130-year-old anti-war group.

The V-22 Osprey, the group said, has been involved in conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali, Yemen and Syria. In a press release criticizing LEGO over the model, the DFG-VK then threw the toymaker's own words from a decade earlier right back at it:

""The basic aim is to avoid realistic weapons and military equipment that children may recognize from hot spots around the world and to refrain from showing violent or frightening situations when communicating about LEGO products. At the same time, the purpose is for the LEGO brand not to be associated with issues that glorify conflicts and unethical or harmful behavior,"" the peace group quoted from a 2010 LEGO report.

LEGO quickly pulled the motorized aircraft model from its inventory in late July. The few sets that had already hit store shelves made their way into the hands LEGO enthusiasts and onto internet trading sites at prices as high as $1,000 for a set that would've retailed at around $120.

Greenwood, the company spokesperson, refused to comment further on why LEGO changed its mind on the Osprey model or why it was produced in the first place.

But LEGO canceling its Osprey set hasn't stopped fans from creating their own versions. In a video interview from Minneapolis, Minnesota, Dan Siskind pulled up a large model of the aircraft to the camera. Although built from LEGO pieces, this one is bigger and, arguably, even more elaborate and life-like. He spun its tiltrotor propellers in a hand-held simulated flight.

Siskind is a former ""master builder,"" the top LEGO designers who assemble the models you find displayed in stores. He is now part of a subculture that unites adult fans of LEGO (or AFOLs as they are known) and military buffs.

Through his company, Brickmania Toyworks , the 51-year-old takes the iconic bricks and turns them into custom military building kits spanning eras and multiple wars.

An arms bazaar for AFOLs, his inventory includes a US F-16 fighter ($425), a Russian T-80BVM main battle tank ($340) and even a Phalanx close-in weapon system, the rapid-fire Gatling gun the US Navy puts on its warships to knock out incoming threats like missiles or speedboats ($175).

There are also historical options, such as a Vietnam War-era Soviet MiG-21 fighter, a World War II Japanese A6M2 Zero or British Spitfire Mk I fighter plane, a US M4A3 Sherman or German Panzer IV Ausf G tank, or a World War I British biplane, all priced around $200.

For those with lower budgets, micro military vehicle sets are sold for around $20.

The parts are almost all genuine, made with new-condition LEGO bricks. But while the Danish company does not endorse its products being used for these purposes, it tolerates the practice, Siskind said.

""They've given us some guidelines -- here's how to stay out of trouble.""

He's nonetheless blunt in describing his job. ""It's just stuff we've taken that weren't supposed to be made into military things, (that) we've made into military things,"" Siskind explained. ""Ordinary LEGO bricks just used in a way they were never intended to be used.""

Because he isn't allowed to purchase bricks directly from LEGO for his military sets, sourcing is ""one big, continuous scavenger hunt"" that requires his staff to comb through Walmarts, Targets and toy stores for discounts on original sets. The company also uses the website Bricklink, a kind of eBay for LEGO parts, where specific bricks can be bought and sold.

All the parts are brought to Brickmania's Minneapolis headquarters, where they are broken down and reallocated to the new kits, including its most expensive design: a Lockheed Martin AC-130 ""Spooky II"" gunship that contains more than 5,200 pieces and sells for $3,755.

In real life, an AC-130 gunship is one of the most terrifying aircraft imaginable. Armed with 40mm and 105mm cannons and a 25mm Gatling gun, it can devastate an area in seconds, earning it the nickname the ""Angel of Death"" in military circles.

When the company made the first 25 models available, they sold out in five hours. A second batch then went in the same amount of time, Siskind said.

""We have more demand than we can keep up with.""

While Siskind will sell you a military kit, his company also encourages AFOLs to produce their own creations, sponsoring regular contests at Brickmania's flagship store in Minneapolis. Among the rules: They must be military or war-themed, bear no Nazi symbols, display no excessive gore and are not of the sci-fi or fantasy genres.

Global community

People entering the competitions should probably be thankful that Ralph Savelsberg lives thousands of miles away in the Netherlands -- because the 45-year-old Dutch builder's portfolio of LEGO-based military creations would likely be easy winners.

There's a Vietnam-era US Navy patrol boat, a Cold War-era intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), an Iranian F-14 fighter, an M-21 reconnaissance jet and a massive and stunning recreation of a B-52 bomber, the mainstay of the US Air Force's bomber fleet for more than six decades.

Savelsberg, a physicist and assistant professor, said he builds LEGO for love, not money.

""This is just a hobby. I do get a lot of requests, but I always disappoint them; I have no interest whatsoever in having to deal with customers.

""Furthermore, making plans or instructions is no fun, so I don't actually have any plans for most of my models,"" he said in an email.

What he does enjoy is getting together with LEGO military builders from around the world at various conventions, where they share creations and even make custom ones to commemorate anniversaries.

For this year's Brickfair Virginia, Savelsberg and a few dozen military builders planned a display themed on the Cold War, including his ICBM. The event was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but Savelsberg plans to return next year.

In 2019, he attended Japan Brickfest, Asia's largest AFOL gathering, which featured a section for military items by some of the 270 builders displaying their work.

Those builders, who came from places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan as well as Japan, likely represent just a fraction of those pursuing the hobby, Savelsberg said.

""I suspect that the people who come to events represent the tip of the iceberg. For every builder who is willing and able to travel to events, there might be two dozen teenagers who rarely get out of their bedrooms and share their builds with a group of friends via social media,"" he said.

In a way, Savelsberg, Siskind and the other builders of LEGO-based military models are doing what LEGO has always encouraged -- ""only the imagination sets the limit to what you can build,"" the company's profile says.

""There's nothing that stops me from using dark green elements I get from, say, a LEGO Mini Cooper for a US Navy patrol boat,"" like this one from the Vietnam era, Dutch builder Ralph Savelsberg said. Credit: Courtesy Ralph Savelsberg

LEGO traces its roots back to Denmark in the 1930s, when carpenter Ole Kirk Kristiansen abbreviated the Danish words ""Leg Godt,"" meaning ""play well"" in English, to brand the wooden toys he was producing. It turned to plastic bricks in 1949.

In 1955, Kristiansen's son Godtfred launched LEGO bricks as a system, embracing the idea that the more you have, the more things you can make. ""Our idea has been to create a toy that prepares the child for life -- appealing to its imagination and developing the creative urge and joy of creation that are the driving forces in every human being,"" he said.

Over the years, wheels and human figures were introduced in 1962 and 1978 respectively. And in 1989, miniature human figures sporting more facial expressions than the usual slight smile also emerged.

LEGO has also been determined to put smiles on the faces of children.

""As a family-owned company with a long-term mission, the LEGO Group is uniquely placed to deliver a positive impact on children, society and the planet,"" the company profile says. The 25-page company document mentions the words ""child"" or ""children"" nearly 100 times.

Still, as LEGO grew over the years, so did the presence of weapons.

A 2016 report analyzing the company's products, published on the peer-reviewed scientific investigation journal PLOS One , argues that LEGO sets ""are not as innocent as they used to be"" and have become increasingly violent over time. Since 1978, when the first weapon bricks -- a sword, a halberd and a lance -- were added to castle-themed LEGO sets, there the amount of weaponry has increased each year, according to the study. It found that by 2014, nearly 30% of sets contained at least one weapon brick.

Some of this increase can be attributed to movie-themed sets. For example, the company's summer 2020 catalog features a model of the Aston Martin, the famous car driven by British spy James Bond. It comes complete with ""a wealth of sophisticated details and 007 gadgetry, including rotating license plates, ejector seat, tire scythes and front-wing machine guns.""

There's also ""Star Wars"" X-wing fighters and Imperial star destroyers, and sets depicting ""Minecraft"" battles, with axes, bludgeons and cases of TNT.

When it comes to the LEGO's ethical red lines, Siskind sees a disconnect in the company's logic. Is there really a difference between the Death Star or the violence of a galaxy far, far away and the machines that kill people here on Earth?

""There's very direct historical connections between the 'Star Wars' world and World War II,"" he added.

Following LEGO's rules

From his office in Atlanta, Andrew Roberts, co-owner of Battle Brick Customs , another aftermarket retailer, expresses what he sees as the LEGO dilemma.

""LEGO has always kind of struggled with filling boys' desires for action and adventure (while) staying true to themselves (by) not doing realistic military things,"" he said.

For a long time, the company even went so far as to avoid gray-colored bricks (the obvious color choice for building military weapons and vehicles), Roberts claimed, saying early castle sets were made from yellow ones. (Siskind, too, recalled some rather colorful medieval builds, saying: ""When I was a kid all my castles were red because I had the most of that color."")

LEGO's avoidance of modern military themes provided an opening, Roberts added. He turned his college pastime -- messing with his old LEGO sets -- into a full-time job, churning out best-sellers like World War II M4 Sherman tanks and modern Gulf War M1 Abrahms tanks.

""I don't think they like what I do but at the same time ... They tolerate me because I obey the rules.""

For instance, Roberts buys minifigures from LEGO, strips them of their paint and markings, and turns them into soldiers, sailors and airmen to stand watch in the military-themed sets he sells. He likens it to how a custom car shop takes a showroom model and turns it into a street racer.

""If you're a shop selling custom Ford Mustangs, you can do that -- people have to know that this is a Ford Mustang, but it's not an official Ford product,"" Roberts said. ""I took a Ford and I did a bunch of stuff to it.""

In the case of LEGO parts, he added, ""It's a genuine LEGO minifigure that has had a bunch of aftermarket stuff done to it. I bought it, and it's mine. And I'm customizing it, and I'm not pretending they did it.""

For much of the fanatic LEGO-building community, the ""it's mine"" mentality -- a personal stake in what they make -- is what's fun and what fills them with pride. And they're not going to let the company's ethos get in the way of their creations.

After the company pulled the Osprey in the summer, The Brothers Brick, an independent, reader-funded website for LEGO enthusiasts, carried several posts about the set's demise. One showed a futuristic olive green vision of an Osprey with orange highlights, created by builder Simon Liu, using LEGO bricks.

Brothers Brick contributor, Lino -- a Washington state-based artist and humorist, according to his biography -- drew inspiration from Liu's creation.

""The point of showing you this is, while LEGO occasionally makes doofus decisions, they provide the pieces so that you can build anything you want. Who needs directions and an official set?"" Lino wrote.

""With LEGO bricks and a bit of imagination, the world is your oyster. Or Osprey.""

Our cities may never look the same again after the pandemic,"From Auckland to Bogota, urban planners are already adapting our cities to lockdown. But will the changes last, and which more radical design proposals -- be it sewer monitors or ""epidemic skyscrapers"" -- will shape the post-pandemic city?

Our cities may never look the same again after the pandemic

For advocates of walkable, unpolluted and vehicle-free cities , the past few weeks have offered an unprecedented opportunity to test the ideas they have long lobbied for.

With Covid-19 lockdowns vastly reducing the use of roads and public transit systems, city authorities -- from Liverpool to Lima -- are taking advantage by closing streets to cars, opening others to bicycles and widening sidewalks to help residents maintain the six-foot distancing recommended by global health authorities.

In Oakland, California, almost 10% of roadways have been closed to through-traffic, while Bogota , Colombia, has opened 47 miles of temporary bike lanes. New York has begun trialing seven miles of ""open streets"" to ease crowding in parks, with Auckland Mexico City and Quito among the dozens of other world cities experimenting with similar measures.

There are many purported benefits of ""reclaiming"" the streets during a pandemic. Encouraging cycling may reduce crowding on buses and subways, where people can struggle to get distance from one another. Vehicle-free roads also offer those without access to parks the ability to exercise safely.

Other urban initiatives have been introduced to directly control the spread of the virus. Cities in the US, Canada and Australia have reconfigured traffic lights so that people no longer need to touch crosswalk buttons. (In any case, many pedestrian crossings are equipped with "" placebo buttons "" that have no impact on whether the lights go green).

It is unclear if these urban interventions will continue once the pandemic is over. Milan plans to build 22 miles of new cycle lanes and permanently widen sidewalks after its lockdown lifts. Authorities in Hungary's capital, Budapest, have suggested that its new bike lanes may become permanent if the measures ""prove favorable,"" while planning officials in Providence, Rhode Island, have said crossings will now remain button-free

But few other cities have been so committal. And it will be harder to make the case for pedestrian- and cycle-friendly streets once their benefits are weighed against the knock-on effects of congestion elsewhere -- especially in countries as dependent on cars as the US.

Indeed, the cities in which pandemic-era measures seem most likely to stick are those already committed to change. Take Paris, for instance, where more than 400 miles of pop-up bike lanes (or ""coronapistes"") are set to open when France's national lockdown ends on May 11. Mayor Anne Hidalgo has called returning to a car-dominated status quo ""out of the question,"" but she was already backing a huge overhaul of biking in the city.

In other words, the pandemic may only have served as a catalyst. But urban planning is a long game in which change is piecemeal and the legacies of past decisions take time to overcome. Public spaces and amenities cannot always be expanded or reconfigured at will.

So, looking to the coming years rather than the coming months, how else might the virus -- or attempts to prevent future ones -- re-shape our cities?

Reimagining public space

Parc de la Distance, a speculative proposal by Austrian design studio Precht, imagines a public park made from a maze-like network of three-foot-wide hedges. The layout provides 20-minute walking routes that can, in theory, be completed while maintaining distance from others, thanks to gates indicating when paths are occupied.

Austrian design studio Precht has imagined a maze-like public park that encourages social distancing.

Czech firm Hua Hua Architects has meanwhile proposed a "" Gastro Safe Zone "" (pictured top) which uses brightly colored ground markings to encourage passersby to keep their distance from al fresco diners. And in Milan, one of the cities worst hit by Covid-19, designer Antonio Lanzillo has envisaged public benches equipped with acrylic glass ""shield"" dividers

Other ideas have ranged from self-disinfecting ""smart"" elevators to door handles that can be easily operated with elbows , rather than hands.

It is too soon to know which, if any, may be realized. But each idea suggests that the practice of social distancing and unease over shared surfaces could continue long after the current crisis.

“ Planners talk about creating 'sticky' streets -- places where people linger and stay around. So the question now is: Will those efforts continue, or how will they need to be changed? Can we still achieve connectivity if we all keep social distancing? ” Jordi Honey-Rosés

If they do, the widely-publicized six-foot distancing guidelines could redefine the layout and spacing of new public facilities, according to Northeastern University's Sara Jensen Carr, whose forthcoming book "" The Topography of Wellness "" considers how urban landscapes have been transformed by epidemics like cholera, tuberculosis and obesity.

""Everybody from Daniel Burnham -- who was the planner of Chicago -- to Le Corbusier came up with arbitrary measurements on their own,"" she said in a phone interview. ""Le Corbusier writes extensively that every 'unit' in the Radiant City (or ""Ville Radieuse,"" the celebrated architect's proposed utopia) needed a specific amount of light ... and a certain amount of cubic feet of air to circulate within it.

""So six feet could be the new unit we use when we think about cities and public parks.""

Yet, the idea of keeping people apart seems to contradict the emphasis planners have traditionally placed on human interaction. Architects, whether designing parks or social housing, have often valued meeting points as sources of collaboration, inclusion and community-building.

""That contradiction is very interesting,"" said associate professor at the University of British Columbia, Jordi Honey-Rosés, who co-authored one of the first academic studies into the potential impact of Covid-19 on public space.

""In fact, if you look at the literature on the health benefits of green spaces, one of the primary (advantages) is social connectivity -- people seeing their neighbors and being part of a community.

""Planners talk about creating 'sticky' streets -- places where people linger and stay around,"" he added, speaking on the phone from lockdown in Barcelona. ""So the question now is: Will those efforts continue, or how will they need to be changed? Can we still achieve connectivity if we all keep social distancing?""

Rather than outlining solutions at this early stage, Honey-Rosés' paper (which, subject to peer review, is set to publish in the journal Cities & Health) instead lays out the questions facing urban planners. Many relate to how cities manage the green spaces that he thinks ""will, overall, be more valued and more appreciated"" after the current crisis.

In addition to their well-documented health and psychological benefits, greener cities may also be more resilient to future pandemics. A recent Harvard study has indicated a possible correlation between air pollution and the likelihood of dying from Covid-19 in the US, while Italian scientists have detected the virus on pollutant particles (and are looking at whether pollution may aid its spread).

Neither line of inquiry has yielded conclusive results. But should a definitive link between pollution and the virus emerge, it would ""really be a game-changer"" for green urban planning, Honey-Rosés said.

""Then, cities will be able to say, 'We're going to redesign our streets not only because we need social and physical distance, but because we need to increase our probability of survival,"" he suggested.

A matter of density

The biggest questions may center around population density. Fears that disease spreads more easily in busy urban centers could already be having an impact on people's attitudes towards living in cities.

indicated that respondents aged 18 to 35 were the most likely to be considering such a move. Data from Harris Poll found that nearly a third of Americans are considering relocating to less crowded places as a direct result of Covid-19. The poll, conducted at the end of April,indicated that respondents aged 18 to 35 were the most likely to be considering such a move.

""Space now means something more than square feet,"" Harris CEO John Gerzema said in a press release. ""Already beset by high rents and clogged streets, the virus is now forcing urbanites to consider social distancing as a lifestyle.""

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also appeared to blame the severity Covid-19 in his city on urban density. ""There is a density level in NYC that is destructive,"" he tweeted . ""It has to stop and it has to stop now. NYC must develop an immediate plan to reduce density.""

So will there be a long-term push for cities to sprawl outwards in order to reduce downtown populations?

According to Carr, the backlash against city centers may be especially acute in America, where high rates of car ownership make suburban life less inconvenient. ""The United States has always been a country that somewhat fears density,"" she said.

But she, like other experts, worries that a potential retreat from cities will come at a cost. After all, density makes mass transit systems viable, improves access to public facilities (including hospitals) and promotes innovation and creativity.

""I think as designers and urban planners we have to think about how we emphasize the benefits of density,"" Carr added. ""Because now, whenever anyone tries to build new housing anywhere, it's probably going to be the first question that people have.""

Even before the development of germ theory, people have distrusted the benefits of living in close quarters. The Victorians' widespread belief that miasma (or ""bad air"") helped spread disease partly justified the clearance of London's 19th-century slums. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, the perils of density were seemingly laid bare when faulty plumbing saw the deadly virus sweep through Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing estate.

“ Six feet could be the new unit we use when we think about cities and public parks. ” Sara Jensen Carr

sparser cities in Europe and the US. Robert Steuteville, editor of the journal Public Square, has But there is not, yet, any clear evidence linking population density to the spread of Covid-19. Hong Kong (which is more densely populated now than it was in 2003, with some neighborhoods housing more than 60,000 people per square kilometer) has more effectively contained local transmission of Covid-19 thansparsercities in Europe and the US. Robert Steuteville, editor of the journal Public Square, has argued that data from the US (such as the high transmission rates in the relatively sparsely-populated New Orleans, for instance) disprove what he calls the ""'density is dangerous' narrative.""

Whether the use of public transport is a significant factor in Covid-19's spread is a theory still being explored. And while, again, the findings remain far from conclusive, mistrust of buses and subways may nonetheless see their use decline.

Honey-Rosés suggested we may instead see the growth of ""micromobility"" -- vehicles like scooters and e-bikes -- though this could be accompanied by reduced demand for initiatives like bike-sharing schemes.

""The sharing model is going to have additional costs related to hygiene and cleaning, which will be very challenging,"" he said, adding that sharing schemes ""might get hurt in this pandemic.""

Blue-sky thinking

Epidemics can have radical and unexpected effects on architecture and design.

The 1918 flu pandemic, for instance, helped transform home bathrooms , leading property owners to install brass fittings and powder rooms to keep guests from the main lavatories. Later that century, sanatoria built to treat tuberculosis came to inspire the white, clinical aesthetic of modernist architecture (while beliefs the disease could be remedied by sunlight influenced the movement's penchant for terraces and roof gardens, according to Carr).

So although considering the impact of Covid-19 is, at this stage, largely speculative, there's plenty of scope for innovation.

Perhaps we'll see the widespread adoption of automatic doors. Perhaps the popularity of urban farming in recent months will offer new relief from the threat of bare supermarket shelves. Or perhaps the installation of sewage monitors will be used to decipher if -- and where -- certain diseases are growing among city populations.

There have been more outlandish ideas, still. Italian designer Umberto Menasci has envisaged a series of acrylic glass boxes that allow beachgoers to relax in isolation. Elsewhere, this year's eVolo skyscraper design competition was won by a prefabricated emergency healthcare tower -- a concept dubbed "" Epidemic Babel "" -- that its Chinese designers claim could be rapidly erected in a future outbreak.

Regardless of such proposals' viability, there is plenty of optimism that this crisis can improve the way cities are designed and run, said Honey-Rosés. But he caveated this by saying politics and opportunism may play significant roles in dictating which ideas come to fruition. (""I'm seeing a lot self-interest in the optimism -- the cyclists are talking about having bigger bike lanes, because that's in their interests,"" he offered as an example.)

But despite his self-professed skepticism, the researcher nonetheless believes that the pandemic has presented real opportunities to rethink public space.

""This is a time for humility on the part of pundits,"" he said. ""And researchers need to be asking good questions. But I also think it's time for city leaders to be bold.

How lavender became a symbol of LGBTQ resistance,"Written by Christobel Hastings, CNN

Every year, as summer beckons, Pride month arrives in a burst of color. Around the world, rainbow flags fly high and revelers turn their faces proudly towards the sky.

The multicolored flag has united the LGBTQ community for over 40 years, and though it remains a universal symbol of pride, liberation didn't always come in vibrant technicolor.

In fact lavender -- a subtle hue that shifts between light pinkish purples, and gray and blueish tones -- has had, despite its whimsical nature, its own historical significance in representing resistance and power.

The making of a color trend

Like many aspects of queer culture, it's not surprising that lavender's unique color symbolism often skirts under the radar, especially when it comes to mainstream society.

In Western culture it started life as a color of desire, thanks to the lyric genius of 7th century BC poet Sappho, whose papyrus fragments told of her erotic predilections for younger women with ""violet tiaras."" Fast forward a few centuries, and in the 1920s, violets were still drawing together members of the lesbian community, who gifted the delicate flowers as an expression of sapphic interest.

... allowed ordinary people to wear this special color,"" explained cultural historian and author of ""The Secret Lives of Colour"" Kassia St Clair. ""In the mid-19th century it was a fashionable color, and men would pair lavender moleskin or doe-skin trousers with blue waistcoats or claret-colored coats without anyone batting an eye."" It wasn't until the 19th century -- with the accidental invention of a purple synthetic dye -- that the color would become popular in fashion. ""Synthetic dyesallowed ordinary people to wear this special color,"" explained cultural historian and author of ""The Secret Lives of Colour"" Kassia St Clair. ""In the mid-19th century it was a fashionable color, and men would pair lavender moleskin or doe-skin trousers with blue waistcoats or claret-colored coats without anyone batting an eye.""

Towards the end of the 19th century, however, the public began linking lavender with homosexuality. Aestheticism, a European arts movement was founded, eschewing Victorian wholesomeness and the perceived ugliness of the industrial age, in favor of beauty, passion and ""art for art's sake.""

Newspapers denounced Aesthetes as effeminate, not least one of the prominent leaders of the movement, Oscar Wilde, who frequently reminisced about his ""purple hours"" spent with rent boys, and provoked a moral scandal with the homoerotic themes in ""The Picture of Dorian Gray.""

The fight for visibility

The 1930s marked the start of a dark period when lavender was cruelly lexicalized. Gay men in America were taunted for possessing a ""dash"" or ""streak"" of lavender, thanks in large part to Abraham Lincoln's biographer Carl Sandburg, who described one of the president's early male friendships as containing a ""streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets.""

During the McCarthy era, there was state-sanctioned discrimination when president Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450, which became part of a national witch-hunt to purge homosexual men and women from the federal government. Dubbed ""The Lavender Scare"" by historian David K. Johnson, the suffocating climate of fear and suspicion subsequently led to around 5,000 federal agency employees losing their jobs on the basis of their sexuality.

In 1969, the color came to symbolize empowerment. Lavender sashes and armbands were distributed to a crowd of hundreds in a ""gay power"" march from Washington Square Park to Stonewall Inn in New York, to commemorate the Stonewall riots that had just taken place a month before.

It was also the year president of the National Organization for Women, Betty Friedan, denounced the lesbian membership she believed would threaten the feminist movement as a ""Lavender Menace."" This time, there was backlash. At the 1970 Second Congress to Unite Women, a group of radical activists wearing hand-dyed purple T-shirts printed with the words ""Lavender Menace"" stormed the stage and kickstarted a conversation on the very topic Friedan had struggled to suppress: lesbianism.

Lavender, however, can't always be neatly defined in terms of pain or protest.

Throughout history, there are endless references to its subversive possibilities, allowing LGBTQ people to express the full range of their humanity. Take the late actor and writer Quentin Crisp, whose lavender tresses were a way of visually disrupting gender norms, right up until his 90th birthday, when he held a party complete with lavender ""napkins, the plates and the frosting on the cake.""

British filmmaker, artist and author Derek Jarman, meanwhile, nurtured the flower among the ""pharmacopoeia"" of medicinal plants at Prospect Cottage, his fittingly boundary-free oasis in Dungeness, southern England. He also cited violet, mallow (mauve) and lavender among the ""colours of Eden"" missing from God's rainbow in his work ""Chroma: A Book of Colour."" Then, of course, there's Gilbert Baker's rainbow flag, which he lovingly re-worked in 2017 with a lavender stripe to "" represent diversity in the era of Trump.""

Living color

These days, the color is being worn with confidence, nonchalance and something that feels like defiance; a nod, perhaps, to the radical protest spirit of the '70s. ""Most simplistically, fashion tends to be cyclical, so colors that haven't been in the public eye for a while are often picked up and reinterpreted by designers,"" said St Clair. ""The interlude allows the designers to reinvigorate them: they feel fresh all over again.""

The color, St Clair said, has been buoyed by the milestones achieved by the LGBTQ community in recent years, including some country's moves to legalize same-sex marriage, and in the US, gay mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential run and last year's Met Gala theme of ""Camp: Notes on Fashion."" The ""attacks on gay and transgender civil rights by the current administration,"" she added, has also increased the spotlight on the community, encouraging them ""to rally around each other and explore and celebrate identifying symbols that have been important to them in the past.""

Perhaps it's why we're seeing the color's resurgence on the spring-summer 2020 catwalks -- in the form of Loewe's 17th century-inspired lace dresses, Max Mara's soft pastel suiting, Valentino's tiered minidresses, and a dress fashioned entirely from chiffon flowers at Marc Jacobs. Or more explicitly celebrated by editor-at-large of American Vogue Hamish Bowles in his flamboyant Maison Margiela Artisanal ensemble at the 2019 Met Gala. If there's one image that shows LGBTQ people that there is a joyous life out there, it's surely Bowles flicking his fringe-lined cape with campish flair.

Why does Bollywood use the offensive practice of brownface in movies?,"Monica Sarkar , CNN Written by

Bollywood may be best known for its glamorous casts, glitzy costumes and energetic dance routines. But it also has a far less flattering reputation -- for promoting the offensive practice of brownface.

""It's actually racism,"" said award-winning film director Neeraj Ghaywan. ""Let's not mince our words.""

In the United States, the concepts of blackface and brownface date back to the 19th century , when white performers would darken their faces with makeup, and use racist stereotypes to portray black and other ethnic minority characters. White performers did this in a time when non-white professionals were themselves barred from employment in the industry.

And the practice dates back even further in England, to the Elizabethan era, when directors traditionally cast white actors to play minority characters in Shakespearean plays. Even into recent decades, the African general in ""Othello"" has long been played by a white actor with darkened skin, including Orson Welles in 1951 and Laurence Olivier in 1965.

It's also appeared in modern films. Dan Aykroyd wore blackface and dreadlocks in 1983's ""Trading Places,"" and Robert Downey Jr. appeared several shades darker in 2008's ""Tropic Thunder,"" to play a white Australian method actor who darkened his skin to play a black man in a Vietnam war film.

Bollywood has adopted brownface in a number of films -- by temporarily darkening the skin of performers, especially when they are portraying characters from disadvantaged backgrounds.

As in the early days of Hollywood, critics of this practice say that Bollywood often prefers this approach to actually hiring performers who have naturally darker skin, thus perpetuating discrimination and inequality in the industry.

For example, the popular 2019 film ""Bala"" featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination on the basis of her skin tone.

The woman was played by famed actress Bhumi Pednekar (pictured above), who had her skin darkened in order to play the role. The move was slammed by some Indian media outlets, commentators and on social media.

Some pointed out the irony of one of the film's promotional posters tweeted by Pednekar, where her character was ""surrounded by skin lightening products (and) is actually lightskinned and in brownface.""

Pednekar defended the director's decision to cast her in the movie, according to Indian media reports, saying factors apart from physical appearance play a major role: ""If a filmmaker has taken me, it is because I add some value to the film."" ​

The director, Amar Kaushik, told the Press Trust of India he ""thought about casting a dark-skinned actor,"" but ""felt Bhumi was superb for this character.""

CNN reached out to Pednekar via her agent and Kaushik for comment, but both ​declined to comment.

The popularity of films that use brownface, such as box office hits ""Super 30"" and ""Gully Boy,"" also released in 2019, suggest that Bollywood ​is yet to come under significant public pressure for a practice that many people consider racist and offensive.

'Glamour behind the mask'

India's attitude towards fairness is an ancient concept.

""It predates colonialism and is certainly linked to caste,"" said sociologist Sanjay Srivastava, who works at the Institute of Economic Growth in Delhi.

""Hindu religious texts are full of what we would now recognize as racial stereotypes: lower caste figures as dark and ugly... To be dark is to be a manual laborer, working in the sun. Fair skin is also a mark of class.""

The arrival of pale-skinned British colonial leaders in the 18th century also had a role to play, deepening the prejudice, he said.

""During the colonial era, race and racism functioned in the context of the so-called mixed-race populations, the Anglo-Indians. The 'closer' you were to a white progenitor, the higher up in the hierarchy of race."" British rule is also blamed for further polarizing the castes.

Fairness, on the other hand, is revered and considered a sign of beauty and status. ""Bollywood, and Indian cinema generally, had two remarkable antecedents: religious iconography and Parsi theater,"" said Vijay Mishra, a Professor of English Literature at Australia's Murdoch University and the author of ""Bollywood cinema: Temples of desire.""

""For both, 'whiteness' was essential,"" Mishra said.

Hindu gods and goddesses are ""remarkably white,"" except for dark-skinned Shiva, Rama and Krishna, he said. In Parsi theater, ""Parsis, through their Iranian ethnicity, are extremely fair.""

India's independence in 1947 paved the way for a new constitution that outlawed caste-based discrimination, but it is still prevalent in parts of India. In its 2019 World Report , Human Rights Watch noted that Dalits, formerly referred to as ""untouchables,"" ""continued to be discriminated against in education and in jobs.""

And colorism, discrimination based on the color of someone's skin, is prevalent in Bollywood, Srivastava argued. ​

""Colorism is not problematized at all, since a vast number of Bollywood cinema relies upon prejudice as a vehicle for entertainment.

""It would be considered perfectly natural that they would don brownface to portray a dark character... (because audiences) also like to be assured that the glamour is still there, behind the mask.""

CNN reached out to Yash Raj Films that handles ""Gully Boy"" actor Ranveer Singh's publicity for comment, but they declined.

""Super 30"" actor Hrithik Roshan's representatives did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

The decision to choose a fair-skinned, famous actor over a dark-skinned performer is based on the desire to make a big budget movie ""financially viable,"" said film director ​Neeraj Ghaywan, who has worked on Bollywood and independent films. ""That is how people think in Bollywood.""

As a member of the Scheduled (or Dalit) Caste, the lowest rung on India's societal ladder, Ghaywan is a rare exception in an industry dominated by higher castes.

He tweeted a callout last year for assistant writers and directors from lower castes to contact him for work.

Ghaywan believes Bollywood's lack of diversity may be partly why caste is misrepresented.

People from the Scheduled Caste make up 16.6% of the Indian population, according to 2011 census figures. But in 2014, analysis by The Hindu newspaper found that only two Bollywood movies made that year had featured a lower caste character in a leading role.

However, Ghaywan argued that the root of the problem is that caste discrimination is deeply entrenched in India and that Bollywood is merely reflecting society's ideals.

""They have been so internalized through our cinema itself,"" he said, referring to an early example of the 1957 Indian epic ""Mother India,"" where actor Sunil Dutt's skin was darkened to play the role of a farmer.

""We internalize it so much that it is part of a muscle memory, and we don't even think about it.""

Bollywood's endorsement of fairness products

But ​like discrimination on the basis of caste, discrimination on the basis of skin color is not confined to the big, Bollywood screen.

Seema Hari was born and raised in Mumbai. She said she was bullied at school for being dark-skinned and even taunted on the street by passersby who would tell her that she was bringing bad luck by showing her face in public.

""I did not know a reality where I was not depressed or suicidal in my childhood,"" said Hari who is now a Snapchat software engineer and model based in Los Angeles.

She also campaigns against colorism, which she said is evident not only in Bollywood but on the shelves of Indian pharmacies and supermarkets that stock skin-lightening products.

Advocates say some of the best-known Bollywood stars are perpetuating the preference for lighter skin by lending their names and faces to the industry's advertising campaigns promoting ""fairness"" creams.

""Some of the ads... were so blatantly racist... If you put a Bollywood star in it, it becomes normal; it becomes what people accept,"" said Hari.

Society's preference for lighter skin has led to a booming global business in skin lightening products. The international market for skin whitening cosmetics is predicted to reach more than $6.5 billion by 2025, according to a report by Global Industry Analysts.

While a handful of Indian celebrities have refused to be associated with skin lightening products, some big names have allowed their faces to be used to promote them in India. ​

Often dubbed the ""King of Bollywood,"" actor Shah Rukh Khan ​endorsed ""Fair and Handsome,"" a fairness cream for men, ​for years.

In 2013, a petition calling for an end to the product's discriminatory advertising garnered more than 27,000 signatories. In 2016, Khan reportedly told The Guardian that he would never use the product himself, although it is unclear whether his sponsorship remains active. His agent did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Khan isn't the only celebrity who has modeled ​for skin lightening products. For example, actor John Abraham currently endorses the Garnier Men PowerLight fairness moisturizer. ""John endorses (the) entire Garnier men's skin care and hair range and the communication is skin and hair care,"" his manager, Minnakshi Das ​said.

In 2014, the Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI) issued guidelines on the promotion of fairness products, stating that they cannot show dark-skinned people as depressed or disadvantaged.

While the independent body said they saw a ""substantial shift"" in discriminatory advertising, Bollywood stars continued to appear in promotions.

In February, the Indian ministry of health and family welfare proposed a draft bill that would ban advert​isements that promote fairness creams, among other items. Law breakers could face a five-year jail term or ​a Rs 50 lakh fine (about $70,000).

""Celebrity endorsements are a huge part of the advertising industry,"" said Shweta Purandare, secretary general of the ASCI.

""It commands about 24% of India's total advertising expenditure... With new regulations... we expect to see celebrities being more cautious."" However, it is not clear from the bill whether celebrities themselves would be punished.

'They just want to be white'

But skin lightening is not limited to over-the-counter creams.

""We have a few patients who aspire to be in Bollywood (and) who are too much into skin lightening treatments,"" said dermatologist Dr. Sujata Chandrappa, who runs a beauty clinic in the southern city of Bangalore.

Clients ask her how certain dark-skinned stars became so fair-skinned. ""This is deep rooted in the Indian psyche, that fairness is the prerequisite factor to enter into the Bollywood industry.""

She told CNN that she tries to talk some people out of the treatments, only offering the skin lightening procedure if a client has skin issues such as melasma, hyperpigmentation, sun damage or age spots. If a client insists on help to make themselves fairer in the absence of any other skin problems, she refuses to carry out the treatment.

""I get this feeling that I'm encouraging racism, which is not acceptable. But they just want to be white."" ​

However, conversations on colorism are starting to change.

Ten years ago, Indian NGO ""Women of Worth"" founded the ""Dark is Beautiful"" campaign that runs workshops in schools, colleges, workplaces and communities across the country to dismantle prejudiced attitudes towards dark skin.

They also initiated the petition against Shah Rukh Khan's endorsement of the ""Fair and Handsome"" cream.

Nandita Das, actress and spokeswoman of the ""Dark is Beautiful"" movement, said the campaign has encouraged victims of colorism to share their stories, exposing the extent of India's obsession with fairness.

""Suddenly, it was out in the open, something that had been there for so long in our matrimonial ads, cosmetics and products that we see all around,"" Das told CNN. ""We wonder why we haven't talked about it much earlier.""

Das, who also screen-writes and directs, believes ""we have a long way to go"" before this billion-dollar industry casts a dark-skinned performer in a leading role.

She said her skin tone would make her ""perfect"" for a lower caste or class role. But when she plays ""an educated or upper middle-class character, often the director, cinematographer, or makeup person tell you: 'don't worry, we'll lighten your skin.'""

Das believes Bollywood directors have the freedom to cast whom they please, but she advises thinking ""deeper into that prejudice.""

Some experts argue that Bollywood's influence on society is bigger than ever, partly because of social media.

On-screen stars ""used to be legends whom nobody saw"" in real life, said film critic Subhash Jha. ""(But) they've started to become very close to their fans, so the impact is larger."" The biggest Bollywood stars have tens of millions of followers on Instagram and TikTok, the video-sharing social networking service.

Hari believes that Bollywood celebrities could be doing much more to change attitudes across the country to dark skin. Imagine ""Shah Rukh Khan walking away from a (fairness product) advertisement,"" she said. ""That itself will change so many minds.""

But does the industry's persistent perpetuation of colorism suggest that it is racist?

""Deeply, fundamentally, irrevocably,"" said Srivastava. ""There are no standards of beauty linked to dark skin... There is no vocabulary within Bollywood to discuss race at all because in broader society, no such vocabulary or context has been allowed to develop.""

When it comes to using brownface in movies, ""they don't even think there's a problem,"" said film director Ghaywan. ""That's the biggest problem.""

From rainbow to gray: The evolution of hair dye,"Written by Marianna Cerini, CNN

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here

For centuries, hair dye has been pivotal in helping people portray a certain image -- to either fit in with the beauty standards of the day or to dramatically subvert them.

Women in particular have long tried to conform with the notion that female beauty comes with a glossy mane -- from blonde to black to dusted with gold or flour, depending on the time and place.

""Throughout history, the status of our hair has served as an instant visual cue for value judgment,"" said Caterina Gentili, PhD candidate at the Centre for Appearance Research in England, in a phone interview. ""One of the many ways for society to objectify female bodies, and deem them worthy, or not, of attention.""

In recent decades, Gentili said ""hair color products have become a key tool for women to stay visible, and shield them from one of the biggest stigmas placed on them: aging.""

By 2025, the global hair color market is expected to be worth around $28 billion , up more than 8% on its estimated value of $17.8 billion in 2019, indicating continuing strong demand for hair-altering products.

However, the figures don't show a small, growing trend among women to embrace their natural locks -- grays included -- as a statement against traditional gender expectations.

Now, dying your hair is not solely about covering up imperfections; it's about upending ideals, making a bold statement and reclaiming your natural hue.

From leeches and sulfuric acid to synthetic dyes

In its early iterations, hair coloring was done by both men and women to enhance their looks or hide white strands, according to Victoria Sherrow's ""Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History.""

Ancient civilizations used rudimentary hair colorants, based on recipes that included cassia bark, leeks, leeches, charred eggs, henna -- still commonly used across the Middle East and India -- and even gold dust.

Ancient Greeks favored gold and red-gold shades, associated with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, health and youthfulness. Likewise, high-class Greek and Roman prostitutes opted for blonde hues to suggest sensuality.

It wasn't until the Middle Ages in Europe that hair dyeing began shifting into a predominantly female habit.

Bleaches, often made with blended flowers, saffron and calf kidneys, were particularly in vogue, although Roman Catholics associated blond hair with lasciviousness.

Red dyes, often a mix of saffron and sulfur powder -- the latter of which could induce nosebleeds and headaches, was popularized during the 16th-century reign of Elizabeth I of England.

The hue was a favorite in Italian courts as well, thanks to Renaissance artist Titian, who painted female beauties with red-gold locks. In the 18th century, European elites favored perfumed white and pastel powders made from wheat flour dusted lightly onto natural hair and wigs.

While most hair dyes were composed of plants and animal products, the evolution of the practice also saw the use of dangerous, even lethal methods to change hair color: lead combs to darken it, or sulfuric acid to lighten it.

It wasn't until the early 20th century that hair dye as we know it -- chemical, in a rainbow of colors, shop-bought or salon-applied -- came to be.

In 1907, a young French chemist named Eugene Schueller used para-phenylenediamine (PPD), a chemical discovered in the previous century, for the world's first synthetic dye, which he called ""Oréal.""

Two years later, Schueller founded his business, the French Harmless Hair Dye Company -- a name meant to alleviate people's fears of using manufactured hair color. In 1909, he decided to change it to something a little snappier: L'Oréal.

The aging card

For the first decades of the 20th century, women were fearful of commercial dye formulants. Chemical hair color was considered unsafe, and the practice itself had an image problem: as in the modest Victorian era, it was seen as something vain women, not respectable housewives, would do.

In the 1940s, even as the beauty trend became more popular, salons offered back entrances for clients who didn't want to make their dye habits known.

To expand their market, some beauty companies decided to tap into the anxiety around aging and sell color as a way to cover up gray hair. A black-and-white French L'Oréal ad from the 1920s depicted a sad-looking woman next to a smiling version of herself in a black bob; the English translation reads: ""Not one more white hair; forever 30 years old.""

A Clairol print campaign from 1943, ""Gray Hair -- The Heartless Dictator,"" declared: ""Without justice or kindness, gray hair can rule your life... It can dictate many things you say or do. No wonder other women refuse to tolerate this tyrant.""

Pressuring women to maintain their hair color as they aged ""was the marketing ploy that made hair dye as ubiquitous as using soap,"" said Claire Robinson, author of the essay ""Grey is a Feminist Issue.

""While the ideal had been perpetuated for generations, the modern beauty industry pushed it in a more aggressive way, playing on insecurities (and) self-doubt.""

Advertising companies also worked on normalizing dyes by selling them on their subtlety, such as the iconic 1956 Clairol ad ""Does she...or doesn't she?,"" which was so popular that copywriter Shirley Polykoff's slogan became a catchphrase in the States. Around that time, the debut of home-color kits also ensured privacy, paving the way for the widespread use of hair dye.

While in the 1950s only 4-7% of American women dyed their hair, by the 1970s, the figure had risen to some 40%. By 2015, an estimated 70% of American women were using it. A 2019 OnePoll survey for haircare brand Living Proof showed similarly high figures in the UK.

In South and East Asia, the picture is similar. In India, where the hair care industry is a $3.3 billion business, colorants account for 18% of the overall hair category and have been growing 15% a year, according to a report by Nielsen . Indian women are particularly fond of Garnier Black Naturals , owned by L'Oréal, currently its highest selling hair dye brand globally.

Sales of hair colorants in the Middle East and Africa registered at $201.88 million in 2017, an increase of almost 10% over 2016, with bleachers as the market's fastest growing segment.

China and South Korea have all seen a huge increase in demand for hair color products, mostly darker dyes, both for men and women. In Japan, the beauty ideal attached to black hair is so strong that some schools force students to dye their hair black, though in recent years the rule has provoked backlash.

But dyeing is no longer just about natural looks. Dip dyes and rainbow hues spanning pink, turquoise and violet have become fashionable for young women across the world and, to an extent, men (such as celebrities Jared Leto and Zayn Malik). Bright shades also began appearing on armpit hair, notably by Miley Cyrus.

Roxie Jane Hunt, a Seattle-based hair stylist who specializes in rainbow dyes, sees this new approach as a way ""to demonstrate personal choice and play around with identity,"" she said over the phone. ""A lot of women feel like they want to stand out, not blend in.""

In Asia, South Koreans especially embraced rainbow dyes, from coral to ash to cherry pink. Chameleon-like hair changes even became a signature look for a number of K-pop stars -- so much so that a new hair color is often seen as signifier of a change in those artists' careers, be it a new album, single, or tour.

Over the last couple of years, a growing number of Asian women have also been going blond or full platinum -- a way for some to feel like a stronger version of themselves

Gray is the new blond

Gray has also become popular -- entering salons and home kits as a ""hot"" new dye.

Shades of silver, steel or platinum white -- for which social media coined the hashtag #grannyhair -- were touted by celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande.

Suddenly, gray tones were cool -- albeit, one might argue, only on women under 40, and when achieved via costly colorants and treatments.

While gray coloring might trend on Instagram, natural gray hair still has a complicated reputation for women around the world -- and in China, men.

""Gray has been made out to be something to be avoided at all costs in the name of self-respect,"" Robinson noted.

For the handful of famous women who have embraced it -- Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Jamie Lee Curtis, Theresa May, Christine Lagarde -- there's a much larger segment of the entertainment, cultural and political worlds that have not.

""The lack of white-haired role models or naturally graying young stylish icons isn't at all surprising,"" Gentili said. ""For a long time, and still today, a woman with gray hair would conjure up images of a grandmother: wise and nurturing, but completely desexualized. Salt-and-pepper men on the other hand -- even that expression is so different! -- are seen as distinguished, charismatic, confident, experienced, sexy.""

For a lot of women, the double standard feels ever-so stifling. Since Truslow Smith launched "" Grombre"" -- a play on gray and ombre -- in 2016, the Instagram account has garnered more than 174,000 followers, with dozens of women submitting photos of their gray heads daily. Truslow Smith, who found her first gray hair at 14 and decided to stop dyeing at 24, said it has encouraged positive conversations around the topic, but also served as a form of validation.

""Embracing natural gray hair truly is a lifestyle shift, not just a trend,"" she said. Most people who do it don't usually return to dyeing. It's a liberating decision.""

She notices how young some of the posters are, and hopes the term ""premature graying,"" which describes people in their 20s and 30s, can be re-evaluated.

""Is it truly 'premature graying,' or has hair dye been established as such a standard that we don't know what natural looks like at certain ages?""

Be it gray or lime green, embracing a color change outside of the established canon is, for many, a leap of faith.

""It's a form of self-expression,"" Hunt said.

All the more if you're asserting yourself as a woman who is not afraid of aging.

""It takes courage,"" Gentili said. ""It's a choice far more rebellious than any pink dye will ever be.""

Why women feel pressured to shave,"Written by Marianna Cerini, CNN

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here.

Type ""When did women start..."" into Google and one of the top autocomplete suggestions to pop up is, ""When did women start shaving?""

The answer goes back centuries. Hair removal -- or otherwise -- has long shaped gender dynamics, served as a signifier of class and defined notions of femininity and the ""ideal body.""

However, in its most recent evolution, body hair is being embraced by a growing number of young women who are turning a source of societal shame and turning it into a sign of personal strength.

The rise of gender fluidity, the body-positivity movement and the beauty sector's growing inclusiveness have all contributed to the new wave of hirsuteness.

""It's been deeply stigmatized -- it still is -- and cast with shame,"" said Heather Widdows, professor of global ethics at the UK's University of Birmingham and author of ""Perfect Me: Beauty as an Ethical Ideal,"" in a phone interview. ""Its removal is one of the few aesthetic traditions that have gone from being a beauty routine to a hygienic one.

""Today, most women feel like they have to shave. Like they have no other option. There's something deeply fraught about that -- though perceptions are slowly changing.""

From ancient Egypt to Darwin

Hairlessness wasn't established as a mandate for women until the early 20th century.

Before that, removing body hair was something both men and women did -- as far back as the Stone Age, then through ancient Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire -- using seashells, beeswax and various other depilatories. In these earlier eras, as Victoria Sherrow writes in ""Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History,"" hairlessness was seen mostly as a way to keep the body clean. Ancient Romans also associated it with class: The smoother your skin was, the purer and more superior you were.

In the Middle East, as well as East and South Asia, threading was used on the entire face. But unibrows were actually considered alluring for both sexes, and were often accentuated with kohl.

In Persia, hair removal and brow-shaping was a marker of adulthood and marriage for women, and was mainly reserved for that occasion. While in China, body hair was long considered normal, and even today woman face far less social pressure to shave.

The same goes for other countries in Asia: While hair removal has become routine for many of the continent's young women, waxing or trimming pubic hair, for instance, isn't as common as it is in the West.

In fact, in Korea, pubic hair was long considered a sign of fertility and sexual health -- so much so that, in the mid-2010s, it was reported that some Korean women were undergoing pubic hair transplants, to add extra hair to their own.

Europeans weren't always obsessed with hair-free skin.

In the Middle Ages, good Catholic women were expected to let their hair grow as a display of femininity, while keeping it concealed in public. The face was the only place where hair was considered unsightly: 14th-century ladies would pluck the hair from their foreheads in order to push back their hairlines and give their faces a more oval appearance. When Elizabeth I came to power in 1558, she made eyebrow removal fashionable.

By the late 18th century, hair removal still wasn't considered essential by European and American women, although when the first safety razor for men was invented by French barber Jacques Perret in 1760, some women reportedly used them too.

It wasn't until the late 1800s that women on both sides of the Atlantic started making hair removal an integral part of their beauty routines. The modern-day notion of body hair being unwomanly can be traced back to Charles Darwin's 1871 book ""Descent of a Man,"" according to Rebecca Herzig's ""Plucked: A History of Hair Removal.""

Darwin's theory of natural selection associated body hair with ""primitive ancestry and an atavistic return to earlier, 'less developed' forms,"" wrote Herzig, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College in Maine. Conversely, having less body hair, the English naturalist suggested, was a sign of being more evolved and sexually attractive.

As Darwin's ideas became popularized, other 19th-century medical and scientific experts began linking hairiness to ""sexual inversion, disease pathology, lunacy, and criminal violence,"" Herzig continued. Interestingly, those connotations were applied mostly to women's body hair, not men's -- not just because of evolutionary arguments but also, the author pointed out, the enforcement of ""gendered social control"" on women's rising role in society. Making women think they had to be hairless to be considered worthy of attention was a heteronormative way of controlling their bodies -- and, inherently, their selves -- through shame, Widdows explained.

By the early 1900s, upper- and middle-class white America increasingly saw smooth skin as a marker of femininity, and female body hair as disgusting, with its removal offering ""a way to separate oneself from cruder people, lower class and immigrant,"" Herzig wrote.

A female 'necessity'

In the first decades of the 20th century, changing fashions -- sleeveless dresses exposing the skin -- further popularized body hair removal in the US.

In 1915, Harper's Bazaar was the first women's magazine to run a campaign dedicated to the removal of underarm hair (""a necessity,"" as it was described). That same year, men's shaving company Gillette launched the first razor marketed specifically for women, the Milady Décolletée. Its advert read, ""A beautiful addition to Milady's toilet table -- and one that solves an embarrassing personal problem.""

The shorter hemlines of the 1930s and '40s, and a shortage of nylon stockings during World War II meant more and more American women began shaving their legs, too. The introduction of the bikini in the US in 1946 also led shaving companies and female consumers to focus on the trimming and shaping of their nether regions.

In the 1950s, as Playboy hit the newsstands (its first issue came out in 1953), clean-shaven, lingerie-touting women set a new standard of sexiness. By 1964, 98% of American women aged 15 to 44 were regularly shaving their legs. Wax strips and the first laser hair removal also debuted around then, though the latter was quickly abandoned for its damaging effects on the skin before being reintroduced decades later.

""And yet shaving was far from being as extreme as it is today,"" Widdows said. ""In the late 1960s and 1970s, full bushes were not at all uncommon, even in Playboy. Around that time you also had the second wave of feminism and the spread of hippie culture, both of which rejected hairless bodies. For a lot of women, body hair was symbol of their fight for equality. It wasn't seen as unnatural -- not yet.""

That shift, Widdows said, kicked off in the following decades, with the rising popularity of waxing, pornography and increasingly explicit pop culture. In 1987, seven sisters from Brazil (known as the J Sisters) opened a salon in New York City offering the so-called ""Brazilian"" -- a complete wax hair removal of the genital region. Celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Naomi Campbell started doing it. The masses followed suit.

""Removing body hair went from being 'expected' to the norm,"" Widdows explained. ""Being hairless has come to be seen as the only 'natural' and clean way to present the body. Except it really isn't.""

With advertising and media further promoting the ideal of hair-free bodies, the idea that female hair is gross has only grown. In turn, methods to achieve hairlessness have become more precise: The last four decades have seen the ascent of electrolysis, pulsed light and more advanced laser technology.

""Anything associated with the 'abject' -- what we expel from our cultural worlds in order to define ourselves -- arouses disgust, shame and hostility almost by definition,"" Herzig told CNN in an email. ""Visible female body hair certainly tends to be treated as abject today. It's worth noting that those are ideas about cleanliness, contingent social norms, rather than about actually removing 'dirt.' Most hair removal practices tend to introduce new opportunities for abrasion and infection.""

Embracing hairiness

In 2008, Breanne Fahs, professor of women and gender studies at Arizona State University, set female students an assignment to grow their body hair and write a paper reflecting on the experience. Fahs later extended the assignment to include the course's men, who were asked to shave their legs. The project still runs today.

""The assignment has spotlighted the cultural inevitability of female hair removal,"" Fahs said in a phone interview. ""Over the years, those who have taken part in it have shared quite consistent issues: a deep sense of shame, struggle with self-confidence, even social ostracism.

""There have also been cases of heterosexism and homophobia -- this idea that growing your leg hair automatically implies you're queer, or shaving it means you're a gay man. Women often don't realize how much society, family and friends weigh in on what we do with our bodies. And how much of what we think is a choice -- that 'I choose to shave' -- has actually been imparted to and enforced upon us for generations.""

But Fahs also saw feelings of empowerment, rebellion and anger stirring from the project. ""Particularly in the last two years, in the wake of the election and the #MeToo movement -- there's been a deeper awareness of the restrictions surrounding women's bodies, of feminism, gender and sexuality, and a willingness to push back against it all, or at least break out of the comfort zone,"" she said.

It's not just Fahs' students.

A new cohort of young women is embracing body hair, especially on Instagram. The phenomenon has also made it into magazines. In the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, actress Emily Ratajkowski posed with unshaven underarms (a full 360-degree turn for the publication since its early anti-armpit hair messages). YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen and musician Halsey have also showed off their body hair.

Newly launched women's shaving brands are also making a case for female fuzz, and encouraging positive conversations around the topic. The Flamingo razor, from the popular grooming line Harry's, emphasizes the right to choose whether to shave with ad slogans like ""No Waxation Without Representation"" and ""We Are Grow Choice.""

ed diverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness. Direct-to-consumer razor start-up Billie , established in 2017, is another company that's marketing the idea of choice. Rather than showing the perfectly smooth models typical of female shaving ads, its campaigns depictdiverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness.

""For so long, advertising has only reinforced the taboo around the subject,"" said Billie co-founder Georgina Gooley in a phone interview. ""We wanted to actually acknowledge that women have body hair, show it, and say that shaving is a choice. If you want to keep your body hair, we celebrate that. And if you want to remove it, that's fine as well.""

Photographer Ashley Armitage, who worked on the Billie campaigns and artfully depicts body hair on her Instagram account , agrees. ""Body hair is a personal choice,"" she wrote in an email. ""Shaving it, waxing it, or growing it are all valid options, and all up to the individual.""

The idea that not shaving can be a choice may not seem revolutionary, when it comes to normalizing body hair. But it could be an important step towards reframing the issue.

""I think more women are realizing how body hair is deeply connected to gender and power,"" said Fahs. ""The emotional nature of what body hair elicits in people has tremendous potential as a tool for activism and social change.""

"Under Xi's rule, what is China's image of the 'ideal' man?","Steven Jiang , CNN Beijing, China Written by

This feature is part of a wider CNN Style series on how culture in China is evolving in the Xi Jinping era.

Musk Ming paints Chinese men in suggestive poses. Delicate ink-formed faces stare longingly from the paper, their lean bodies dressed in green caps with red stars. Some wear white and navy sailor hats with ribbons. Others are cloaked in olive coats with brown faux fur collars. The men may not be wearing much, but the accoutrements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) are unmistakable.

For Ming, born and raised in China but living in Berlin since 2005, the risqué motif of homoerotic PLA soldiers came naturally.

""Expectation"" by Musk Ming. Credit: Musk Ming

""I paint what interests me -- and from personal experience,"" said the 40-year-old gay artist, who uses ""Musk Ming"" as a pseudonym. He grew up in a military compound in northern China and attended a Chinese naval academy before moving to Germany. ""The soldiers I saw were the ideal men: young, innocent ... and beautiful.""

That's hardly how China's strictly controlled state media described uniformed men in its recent exhaustive coverage of the country's grand military parade, which marked the 70th anniversary of Communist rule.

On October 1, millions of Chinese viewers watched an all-powerful President Xi Jinping approvingly inspect 15,000 PLA troops -- mostly young male soldiers with chiseled faces and fierce looks -- as they goose-stepped through the center of Beijing, followed by columns of tanks, missiles and drones.

Underscoring the soldiers' physical and mental toughness, adulatory news reports detailed every aspect of their selection and training for the grandiose display of Chinese military might.

The vast chasm between Ming's work and the images shown in state media perfectly illustrates a heated debate in China about what constitutes the image of the ""ideal man.""

It's a conversation unfolding as the ruling Communist Party's cultural czars tighten their grip over the country's creative sector by, among much else, regulating the on-air appearances of male celebrities, from movie stars to boyband members.

Depicting masculinity in art

In discussions about masculinity in China's heavily censored cyberspace, a consensus often emerges on the gold standard of an ideal Chinese man: the PLA soldier.

It's a sentiment that experts say has been reflected in art throughout the history of the People's Republic, which was founded in 1949 by Mao Zedong following the Communists' triumph in a bloody civil war.

From vintage propaganda posters to slick new music videos, images of PLA troops have long shaped modern Chinese perceptions of masculinity. The soldiers' strong bodies and minds are touted as the ultimate male virtues, along with their fierce loyalty to the party -- qualities that some say Xi eagerly wants to promote as he vows to lead China into a great ""national rejuvenation.""

For the first three decades of Communist rule, artistic depictions of Chinese men were dominated by heroic portrayals of PLA soldiers and, to a lesser degree, farmers and industrial workers -- two pillars of the proletariat class.

Although some of the genre's works were created with ink, in a traditional Chinese style, the majority comprised neoclassical oil paintings or watercolors by artists who either studied overseas or were influenced by Western trends, according to You Yang, deputy director of the Beijing-based UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.

Neoclassical art, which traces its origin to ancient Greece and Rome though it rose to prominence in 19th-century Europe, is known to feature male protagonists with accentuated muscles striking gallant poses.

After 1949, Mao made it clear that ""all artwork must reflect the leadership of the Party and the will of the state,"" said You, explaining that neoclassicism found fertile ground in Communist societies -- first the Soviet Union and then China -- where artists used the style to fulfill their political duty of worshipping war heroes or strongman leaders.

The oil painting ""Forcibly Crossing the Dadu River"" is one oft-cited example in this category. Illustrating a turning point during the Red Army's famous Long March in the 1930s, the unknown artist depicted 10 young soldiers on a small boat as they charged toward enemy fire.

Their tanned, sinewy arms in various states of motion, half of the soldiers row the vessel against rapid currents and high waves, while their comrades point their guns at the banks -- a moment in time, captured before Communist troops clinched what they have since described as a miraculous victory against a bigger and better-armed enemy.

Such portrayals of male characters and historic victories reached their peak during the decade-long Cultural Revolution that Mao launched in 1966. In paintings, as well as on stage and on screen, all protagonists -- who were almost always men -- had to be ""red and bright"" to highlight their revolutionary credentials and heroism.

The result was an inevitably politicized masculinity, said You, represented by military men with sharp jawlines and muscular arms. Throwing their clenched fists into the air as they vowed to defeat the enemy, these heroes were devoid of any hint of sexuality, in line with the party's puritanical moral code.

Mao's death in 1976 spelled the end of the Cultural Revolution, but the now-entrenched public perception of masculinity persisted despite growing diversity in artistic depictions of men -- a trend that began with the display of male subjects in more vulnerable emotional states, ranging from angst to melancholy.

'Little fresh meat'

In a country now boasting more than 800 million internet users, the ideal aesthetics of the PLA soldier are being challenged by a new generation that increasingly looks to young celebrities -- and their social media presence -- for cues on what it means to be a man.

This includes some of the country's most bankable young entertainers, including singer-actor Lu Han, who appeared alongside Matt Damon in the 2016 action film ""The Great Wall"" and has more than 60 million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo, and boyband TFBoys, three teenage heartthrobs estimated by local media to be multi-millionaires.

Dubbed ""little fresh meat"" by domestic media for their boyish features and popularity, many of today's young male celebrities put on makeup, dye their hair bright colors, accessorize and sport androgynous clothing. Like South Korean K-pop stars, they boast slender figures and often wear cutesy expressions.

In a report released early this year, the online shopping platform of Chinese tech giant Alibaba found sales of men's cosmetic products jumped more than 50% in 2018, naming the popularity of ""pretty boys"" as a reason.

But after a period of social liberalization in the post-Mao era, there are signs that Xi's government is beginning to turn against male role models deemed too effeminate. A widely cited commentary , published last year by state-run Xinhua news agency, said: ""Whether a country embraces or rejects (effeminate men) is ... a grave matter that affects the nation's future.""

Focusing its ire on wildly popular male idols, the article blasted the ""sickly aesthetics"" that had propelled ""gender-ambiguous, heavily made-up, tall and delicate"" young men to stardom on television and online.

""The phenomenon of 'sissy men' has caused a public backlash because the impact of such sickly culture on the youth cannot be underestimated,"" it said.

""When critics say 'sissy young men turn a nation sissy,' they may sound somewhat facetious,"" it added. ""(But) nurturing a new generation that could rejuvenate the nation requires the resistance of erosive unhealthy culture.""

Following Xinhua's lead, other Chinese media outlets have published blistering editorials and commentaries criticizing male celebrities who appear effeminate.

There have also been user-generated online campaigns calling for some celebrities to be banished from the country's airwaves and internet platforms because of how they look. The government also seems to be tightening restrictions on what is seen on screen.

Earlier this year, China's major video-streaming platforms began censoring male actors' earrings, blurring their earlobes. Incidentally, the ban came after censors prohibited the depiction of same-sex relationships on television and online, along with a wide range of what China calls ""vulgar, immoral and unhealthy content"" that also includes incest and one-night stands.

Some targeted celebrities, including TFBoys, have responded to critics by ditching cosmetics and flowery wardrobes in favor of showing toned muscles in photo shoots.

Another trend has been the launch of a growing number of so-called ""masculinity programs"" aimed at instilling traditional gender roles in boys and young men through outdoor sports and classroom training. Last year, one such club in Beijing attracted attention -- and some criticism -- for having its students run shirtless in the dead of winter. ""There is a crisis in boys' education and I threw myself into practical actions to save them and help them find their lost masculinity,"" the Boys' Club founder told the South China Morning Post.

""'Sissy men' are under attack because they are perceived to be challenging the traditional notion of manliness,"" said Fang Gang, an associate professor at Beijing Forestry University whose research focuses on gender studies and sex education.

Fang points out that, ironically, the current controversy is partly due to recent progress made by sexual minorities in China. Activists say a nascent but increasingly visible LGBTQ rights movement is slowly changing hearts and minds, encouraging greater social acceptance.

""Some parents extend their worries about perceived gender-neutral appearances by linking it to homosexuality,"" he said. ""Greater social acceptance of the gay community has only deepened fears among homophobic people, making them more anxious and afraid of non-mainstream masculinity.""

Others suspect a more direct link between the crackdown on ""sissy men"" and top officials' worldviews, which for many were shaped during the Cultural Revolution.

The strongman

President Xi's attitude towards masculinity may trace back to his youth, which, from the late 1960s to mid-1970s, was spent in the Chinese countryside along with as many as 17 million other high school students and graduates. They were part of the ""sent-down"" generation relocated to the country's far-flung corners to learn agricultural and political lessons from poverty-stricken peasants.

""In the summer, I was almost sleeping in a pile of fleas -- all the bites and subsequent scratching turned my whole body swollen,"" he wrote in 2002. ""But after two years, I became used to it and could sleep through the night no matter how much I got bitten.""

The Chinese leader's definition of manliness also has a political dimension. During a meeting with officials in southern China just months after taking power, Xi reportedly lamented the lack of strong convictions among Soviet communists when their party was on the verge of collapse. He was widely quoted by overseas Chinese-language media as saying that: ""In the end nobody was a real man, nobody came out to resist.""

Xi's government seems determined to resist the perceived feminization of Chinese men through regulations and propaganda.

In a sign of a tightened political environment, artist Ming was reluctant to acknowledge the sensitivity of his art, which includes an almost-naked portrayal of the iconic PLA soldier from the Cultural Revolution-era opera ""Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy.""

""Strength is needed -- with muscles -- for militaries, revolutions and the proletariat, which means manual labor,"" said Ming. ""But in traditional Chinese art and literature, male beauty is about being delicate, pale and pretty,"" he added, pointing to a contradiction in the way men have been depicted through history.

""I paint from a Chinese perspective -- and my work is on a continuum of Chinese aesthetics,"" he said.

For now, Ming's website remains blocked in China and the artist doesn't foresee his work being exhibited in his home country anytime soon. The cultural tradition that inspired him appears increasingly incompatible with the muscular strength appreciated and projected by the Chinese leader at home and abroad.

Last year, China's largely ceremonial parliament endorsed a constitutional amendment scrapping presidential term limits and paved the way for Xi, 66, to stay in power indefinitely. Nevertheless, Ming anticipates an eventual change of guard in leadership -- and the impact it could have on cultural attitudes.

""The older generation finds it harder to accept new things ... it applies to not just 'sissy men' but many other things,"" he said. ""I think we need time.""",
The most anticipated buildings set to shape the world in 2020,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

But at the dawn of a new decade, it seems fitting to look ahead at the structures set to shape our cities -- and architecture itself -- in the coming year.

From museums and skyscrapers, to a hotel with a hole in it, these are CNN Style's most anticipated buildings opening or completing in 2020.

Vancouver House, Vancouver, Canada

BIG / Luxigon

Twisting from a triangular base to a rectangular top, Vancouver House appears to defy the laws of engineering when viewed from afar.

It's precisely the sort of eccentricity we've come to expect from Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect who recently built a ski slope on top of a power plant in Copenhagen. But it's also a smart response to various restrictions and regulations that limited the size of the tower's footprint in downtown Vancouver.

The pixelated facade, also characteristic of Ingels' work, helps to create deep-set balconies for residents in the 493-foot-tall tower.

Nanjing Zendai Himalayas Center, Nanjing, China

MAD Architects

Taking inspiration from traditional Chinese ""shanshui"" paintings (literally ""mountain and water""), Ma Yansong's curved creations merge nature with the built environment. This new 23-acre development in the historic city of Nanjing is surely the most ambitious realization of the architect's ""shanshui city"" concept to date.

Irregular white fins give the complex's towers the appearance of icy mountains, their flowing lines contributing to what Beijing-born Ma's firm, MAD, describes as a ""philosophy of cooperation between humanity and nature."" At ground level, six separate plots are connected via man-made streams and footbridges.

With the country's authorities pushing for increasingly conservative architecture , the complex is a refreshing reminder of what bold Chinese architecture can look like.

Powerhouse Telemark, Porsgrunn, Norway

Bloomimages / Snøhetta

Snøhetta made international headlines last year when its underwater restaurant -- Europe's first -- opened near the southernmost tip of Norway. But the design firm has also gained a reputation for innovative carbon-negative buildings that, over their lifetimes, produce more energy than they consume.

Located on the banks of the Porsgrunn River, the practice's latest ""energy-positive"" project, Powerhouse Telemark, has been designed to ""set a new standard for the construction of the buildings of tomorrow.""

Everything about the sleek structure, which is almost entirely coated in photovoltaic cells, has its carbon footprint in mind, from a diamond shape that maximizes the solar energy it captures, to the use of recycled materials from local demolition projects.

New Museum of Western Australia, Perth, Australia

In designing a museum on a site littered with historic buildings, architecture firms Hassell and OMA faced a delicate task: building a 21st-century museum while preserving the surrounding heritage.

The result is a striking contemporary creation that complements, interacts with and wraps around existing structures -- some of which date back to the mid-19th century -- producing an unlikely synergy of brick, glass and steel.

Perhaps the most striking feature is how the museum's huge upper volume hangs dramatically over Hackett Hall, the State Library's old reading room.

Grand Egyptian Museum, Cairo, Egypt

Such have been the delays facing the Grand Egyptian Museum that it featured on this very list two years ago -- and the $1-billion project is still yet to open.

Having said that, 2020 looks sure to be the year it finally does. As well as offering a permanent home to tens of thousands of archeological treasures, including the entire contents of Tutankhamun's tomb, the 5.2-million-square-foot museum symbolizes efforts to repair the country's tourism industry in the wake of the 2011 revolution.

The building's glass-fronted design, first unveiled over 15 years ago, will offer sweeping panoramas of the Great Pyramids and Giza plateau.

Berlin Brandenburg Airport, Berlin, Germany

Berlin's new Brandenburg airport is, perhaps, less anticipated for its design than for the fact it's almost a decade late.

Following years of setbacks, the German capital's new transport hub is finally due to open its doors in 2020. And while it wouldn't be the project's first missed deadline (officials initially expected it to open in October 2011), there seems to be an air of certainty about the recent announcement that the airport would enter operation in October.

The terminal building, which sits between two parallel runways, was designed to represent the region's architectural heritage. Official press materials cite the influence of 19th-century Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the celebrated Bauhaus art school.

Opus, Dubai, UAE

Laurian Ghinitoiu / Zaha Hadid Architects

More than three years after her death, Zaha Hadid continues to shape the world's cities with her bold, curvilinear creations.

Opus, which was first proposed by the British-Iraqi architect in 2007, takes the form of a glass-fronted cube punctured with an asymmetric hole that appears to bulge at the seams. Yet, closer inspection reveals that the building is formed from two separate towers joined by a four-story atrium at its base and a footbridge connecting the upper floors.

The structure will house a boutique hotel -- with interiors also designed by Hadid -- as well as office space and restaurants. Despite being located just a kilometer from the 2,717-feet-tall Burj Khalifa, it might yet be the neighborhood's most eye-catching piece of architecture.

1000 Trees, Shanghai, China

British designer Thomas Heatherwick has never been short of ambition. And now his seemingly farfetched vision of a tree-covered urban mountain has become a reality.

The 3.2-million-square foot development now occupies a huge stretch of riverside in Shanghai. Structural columns emerge from the structure's mass to hold some of the plants and greenery alluded to in the project's name, 1000 Trees.

More than a piece of architecture, this is, in Heatherwick Studio's own words, ""a piece of topography.""

Set across a huge swathe of reclaimed land in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour, the West Kowloon Cultural District has been more than 20 years in the making. And of the many theaters and cultural institutions set to eventually open in the development, none are more hotly anticipated than M+.

The museum is expected to have one of the Asian continent's most impressive collections of contemporary visual art. Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron has built a visually arresting design to boot -- a horizontal slab (containing exhibitions spaces) and a vertical one (housing everything else) conjoined into an upside-down ""T.""

Although the building is set to complete within the next few months, it will be another nine to 12 months before it is opened to the public. Nonetheless, the completion of M+ is a major milestone for the long-awaited cultural quarter.

Singapore Pavilion at the Dubai Expo 2020, Dubai, UAE

Singapore Pavilion, Expo 2020 Dubai

From October, Expo 2020 will see hundreds of participating countries construct pavilions in and around Dubai. There will be plenty of impressive architecture on display, from Canada's circular wooden theater to Austria's ensemble of huge interlocking cones

But perhaps the most ambitious idea is that of Singapore: to create an oasis in the Arabian desert.

The city-state's pavilion will bring dense greenery to the UAE, with canopies leading visitors through a lush hanging garden of trees, shrubs and orchids. And the architecture firm behind the project, WOHA, thinks it can make the project energy neutral over the course of the expo.

Seoul's burgeoning drag scene confronts conservative attitudes,"Written by Stella Ko, CNN Seoul, South Korea

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here.

Hurricane Kimchi takes the stage at an underground bar in Seoul, dancing agilely to Wonder Girls' 2008 K-pop hit ""Nobody.""

Dressed in high heels, a fluffy white wig and a tight gold sequin dress -- an homage to the song's video -- he commands a fervent crowd that cheers, sings along and throws money at his feet. At one point, an audience member runs up to shove a 10,000-won bill (around $9) inside his belt.

Drag queens remain a rare sight in South Korea. But Hurricane Kimchi's alter-ego, LGBTQ activist Heezy Yang, is out to change perceptions in a country with traditionally conservative views on gender and sexuality.

novel about his experience of coming out, to taking part in a mock gay wedding ceremony in Seoul's metro. He is also the founder of the The activist's work ranges from writing anovel about his experience of coming out, to taking part in a mock gay wedding ceremony in Seoul's metro. He is also the founder of the Seoul Drag Parade , an annual event that hopes to ""encourage both queer and non-queer people to use drag to find their identity (and) express their true feelings, thoughts and style,"" according to its website.

Then there are the weekday drag shows he organizes in Itaewon, a diverse international neighborhood that has become the capital's main gay district and is known as ""homo hill"" to the LGBTQ community and locals.

With US troops setting up in Itaewon after the Korean War, the neighborhood gained a reputation for prostitution and nightlife. Trans and drag performers began appearing in clubs for soldiers' entertainment, and the area soon became a refuge for different kinds of marginalized people, according to Todd Henry, a professor of modern Korean history at the University of California, San Diego.

""It is an incredibly diverse (environment, and) the drag scene is definitely something that has been there for a long time, since the 1970s,"" he said in a phone interview. ""And these days, some of the most visible and creative artists and activists come from ... the drag queen community.""

These days, some of the most visible and creative artists and activists come from ... the drag queen community. Todd Henry, a professor of modern Korean history at the University of San Diego

Drag may still be a fringe subculture in South Korea, but the scene appears to be growing. The first Seoul Drag Parade, held last year, attracted over 1,000 participants, far surpassing the initial estimate of 100 people, according to the parade's co-organizer Ali Zahoor. Participation in pride events is also expanding, said Eun-oh Yang of the Korean Sexual Minority Culture and Rights Center.

over ""Compared to the past, drag culture exists in more diverse forms for both men and women, and now we have drag queens performing on stage at (the annual) Queer Culture Festival,"" she said, referring to Korea's largest LGBTQ festival, which attractedover 150,000 participants in 2019. ""I think it's being established as (part of) popular culture.""

Drag as a release

Like drag queens around the world, Hurricane Kimchi uses performance to express himself and to break ""the stereotypes and get rid of toxic masculinity,"" he said.

Co-organizer of the Seoul Drag Parade, Ali Zahoor, said there are also uniquely Korean reasons for the growth of Seoul's drag scene -- including the ""anxiety"" caused by the threat of war.

""North Korea's right there ... We are not scared, or we're not thinking about it too much, but it is in the back (of our minds),"" he said. ""Everyone's a little bit anxious all the time (and) I think that's where subcultures emerge.""

""Korean society, as you can imagine, is crazy stressful,"" Zahoor added. ""Working hours are so long, kids have to study until really late at night and there's a need for an escape. (Drag) is a way of getting away from what you usually do, having fun and showing off what you are good at.""

Gender-fluid drag queen and YouTuber, Serena 303 , uses K-pop and '70s fashion models as inspiration for her looks, which includes a transparent plastic dress paired with a pink visor. Her videos, in which she offers makeup tutorials and shares what it's like to be in drag, are designed to empower those still figuring out their identities.

""I want to tell them that it's OK to be who you are, and show them that someone like me can do drag,"" she said. ""The most important thing is that people are going to love you.""

For Seoul-based ""drag king"" and English teacher, Jaxter the Taco Master, drag is both an anti-depressant and a play on gender. She is virtually unrecognizable on stage, with smoky eyes and her face entirely covered in gold glitter.

""Gender is a social construct (and) I can be both masculine and feminine whenever I want,"" she said.

""It's not just what other people want me to be.""

'Don't ask, don't tell'

There remains a pervasive ""don't ask, don't tell"" attitude towards gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ communities in South Korea. Hurricane Kimchi, who uses public transport to travel to his weekly show, said that no one dares look at him during the 30-minute journey.

""People might think and judge, but they wouldn't say anything out loud,"" he said. ""Even when I walk around with my drag makeup, people don't even look at you, they don't really do or say anything.""

While he now feels comfortable putting on makeup at home, it took his mother ""years"" to accept his new identity.

""I think she gradually realized that it's not 'my good little boy, a straight-A student' anymore,"" he said.

In 2014, South Korea's Conservative social attitudes remain prevalent throughout South Korea, which does not legally recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions. Homosexuality remains illegal in the military where it is punishable by up to two years in prison.In 2014, South Korea's National Institute of Korean language reverted its 2012 decision to make the word 'love' gender-neutral after complaints from religious groups. It now defines love as a feeling of affection ""between man and woman.""

Whether you are gay, lesbian or transgender, living as a sexual minority in Korea is very difficult. Eun-oh Yang, Korean Sexual Minority Culture and Rights Center

""(The) LGBT population will be labeled as going against the Bible (or) going against Confucian tradition and parental values,"" said Henry, the history professor. ""There are even arguments made that gay and lesbian (people) are pro-North Koreans, that they are kind of traitors to their nation.""

Serena 303 said she faced protests from conservative Christians during the Seoul pride parade last year. ""They would say 'You're gay, you're going to die,' and 'Think of your parents,'"" she recalled.

2017 poll by the Korean Society of Law and Policy on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) found that 92.6% of LGBTQ Koreans surveyed were afraid of becoming targets of hate crimes, and 49.3% had experienced ""psychological trauma,"" such as stress and depression, after encountering ""expressions of disgust.""

""Whether you are gay, lesbian or transgender, living as a sexual minority in Korea is very difficult,"" said Yang.

Slow shift toward acceptance

The influence of pop culture may be helping the drag community gain greater acceptance. Hurricane Kimchi said the arrival of Netflix in South Korea in 2016, which brought shows like ""RuPaul's Drag Race,"" exposed many people to drag culture for the first time.

The internet is also taking drag culture out of the clubs and into the bedrooms of young South Koreans.

""Before the internet, the drag world would have been confined to the physical space of the club,"" Henry said. ""Now with the internet and Youtube, you can kind of fashion yourself and your style and persona, and you can communicate with other people virtually. That's a really interesting phenomenon.""

And it's having a wider impact on South Korea's LGBTQ community. Parades, events and shows all help to bring drag to a broader audience, Hurricane Kimchi said.

On stage, he may convey the audacious glamour common to leading stars of the drag world.

But for Kimchi, drag is not just about performing -- it's about breaking down barriers and encouraging other people to embrace their true identities.

""I'm not going to be the prettiest beauty queen or the best performer, or the highest paid drag performer,"" he said. ""Those are not my goals.""

""I want to combine drag with activism and art and provide people safe space where they can perform drag and try out drag.""",
Menswear has never been so casual. So why is the image of a man in uniform still so alluring?,"Written by Paul Flynn, CNN

From Tom Cruise in ""Top Gun"" to Richard Gere in ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" Hollywood has long-popularized the image of a man in regimented attire. And while menswear has never been more casual, references to the uniform are still present in contemporary collections today. So just what is it about a man in uniform?

From military, to work and sports, uniforms command attention, and the big screen has created a romanticized version of the men behind uniforms.

""Is it an authority thing?"" asked Luke Day, editor of GQ Style. ""Is it a dominance thing? I think ultimately there's a romantic ideal to uniforms because most men in uniforms are heroes.""

Many of the staple items usually found in a stereotypical man's wardrobe -- be it deck shoes, the MA1 bomber jacket, chinos, khakis, epaulettes, a parka or field coat -- are directly descendant of uniforms.

""All menswear is uniform,"" said Julian Ganio, menswear consultant for Fendi. ""It's so tribal, something that's planted in (a man's) brain.""

Standardized dressing has been created to bind people together, but also to set them apart from other groups. ""Men like to be part of a gang,"" said Ganio. ""We want to be with like-minded men. And we want to belong.""

Recently, British professor of fashion design Andrew Groves curated an exhibition titled ""Invisible Men,"" from the menswear archive for the University of Westminster. According to Groves, communication between men is dictated by ""unspoken (style) judgments,"" but the historic narrative behind how men came to dress the way they do remains unexplored territory.

The 170-piece show, which draws an alignment between uniform and fashion, is in part a showcase of the larger Westminster archive, as well as a smart retort to the dearth of menswear exhibits on the art and fashion calendar. ""At the recent Dior show [at the V&A museum],"" said Groves, ""there was no menswear. Nothing. The same at the McQueen.""

Groves took a prosaic approach when curating ""Invisible Men,"" by drawing on the seemingly invisible fashion of British men -- largely missing from museums -- and its roots in uniforms. For this exhibition, he chose to celebrate the style that begins on football terraces and in local pubs, the elements of which are passed down, from father to son, and then twisted to each new generation's tastes.

Groves himself is a Man City season ticket holder and he already knows of several Arsenal fan clubs who have booked tickets for ""Invisible Men,"" on account of its exhaustive archive of Stone Island and CP Company workwear. ""Men have a structure, which goes by unnoticed,"" said Groves, ""But other men notice it. It is a secret code.""

At the Spring-Summer 2020 Maison Margiela show, John Galliano caused a disruptive fashion moment by sending a model,who appeared on the verge of exploding with internal rage, dressed in a sailor-inspired jacket stomping down the runway, perhaps a nod to Brad Davis's mesmerizing role in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ""Querelle,"" a film about a young sailor.

""If you look at all the British design greats,"" said Day, ""they have regimented uniform detailing in so much of their work. McQueen was full of them.""

Just recently, British menswear's critically acclaimed designer Craig Green created the concierge's uniform for Andre Balacz's newly opened Standard Hotel in London.

Day attributes much of the interest in uniforms to iconic movie imagery men usually become familiar with while they're still young.

As part of his work, Day styles Take That and their former bandmate Robbie Williams. ""There hasn't been a mood board for a single Take That tour that hasn't included a picture of Terence Stamp in 'Far From The Madding Crowd,'"" he said. ""The proportions are so sexual. The broad shoulder and high narrow waist. The way [Stamp]'s military trousers are cut you get a long, lean thigh.""

The image of a man in uniform has often carried a certain sexual undercurrent. ""Think of the Fireman's Ball [episode] in 'Sex and the City,' or Channing Tatum in 'Magic Mike.'"" said Day. ""Uniforms are routinely fetishized. Every basic hen-night stripper has two fails safe costume changes: 'Here's the fireman. Here's the policeman,'"" he added.

Even Andrew Scott's clerical-collared ""Hot Priest"" character, in the award-winning British TV show ""Fleabag,"" recently provoked an international outpouring of love. As it happens, one of the items on display at ""Invisible Men"" is a clerical garment.

""What's lovely about a uniform is that you can be anonymous,"" said Groves, ""and yet it gives you a set of rules that you can break, which is so much a part of the British menswear story. A uniform allows you to do something naughty that you shouldn't do.""",
Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"Written by Jorge Grimberg, CNN

In February, the Brazilian fashion industry made global headlines. Donata Meirelles , then fashion director at Vogue Brazil, was celebrating her 50th birthday in the predominantly black city of Salvador, Bahia. During the celebration, journalist Fabio Bernardo snapped a photo of Meirelles, who is white, sitting in a traditional throne-like chair flanked by two baianas (Afro-Brazilian women wearing white lace gowns and headpieces), which he then shared on Instagram.

To many who saw the post (which has since been deleted), the scene evoked colonial Brazil, when white elites ruled over black slaves.

""What happened there is what happens in this country built on racism, bodies, sweat, blood and black tears,"" Afro-Brazilian actress and activist Tais Araujo, Vogue Brazil's November 2018 cover star, posted to her Instagram account in the days following the event. ""This suffering is so naturalized that it is difficult for people who do not identify with the girls standing by the chair to feel what the black population feels. Everything becomes natural.""

While the party was not an official Vogue event, the backlash was enough to warrant Meirelles' resignation from the title just a few days after the event, and a public apology from the magazine, who wrote on Instagram that they hoped the discussions sparked by the incident had ""served as a learning opportunity."" (Both Meirelles and Vogue Brazil declined to be interviewed for this story.)

And it has: On social media and beyond, the industry and the public have been having long overdue conversations about race and representation in Brazil's fashion community.

According to a Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics study released in 2016, 54% of Brazilians identify as black or multiracial. And yet black people have been all but erased from the mainstream fashion industry -- in front of the camera, on the catwalk and behind the scenes.

Historically, model diversity at São Paulo Fashion Week has been so low that in 2009, following intense pressure from anti-racism activists and state prosecutors, the organizing body mandated that 10% of models in each show must be black.

At last edition of São Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW), which took place in April month, black models were still in the minority, and for the last three seasons, only one black designer -- Luiz Claudio of Apartamento 03 -- has participated. (SPFW CEO Paulo Borges told CNN that organizers are aware of the disparity and are discussing ways to bring in new players.)

Why model Leomie Anderson is fighting for change

""In a country where most of the population is black, it's troubling to think that fashion, one of the most important vehicles of cultural and social expression, excludes such large numbers of creators and consumers,"" Afro-Brazilian artist and fashion designer Carol Barreto, who teaches gender studies at the Federal University of Bahia, said in an email.

""The entertainment world is highly susceptible to reproducing stereotypes, so it's important to study the limits and latitudes imposed when dealing with questions of race,"" she continued, because the propagation of negative images can contribute to perceptions of Black people as inferior.

Juliano Corbetta, founder and editor-in-chief of the online menswear publication Made in Brazil, has witnessed how racial inequality in Brazil can affect a magazine financially.

In early 2018, Corbetta set out to publish an issue that was would feature predominantly black talent (including producers, photographers and models) to inspire ""16-year-old kids dreaming of breaking into a fashion career."" Though he had no trouble finding talent to fill the pages, he was frustrated by how difficult it was to secure the advertisements needed to fund the issue.

""Reality hit. For the first time in nine years in publishing, everyone declined. No one wanted to include this (magazine) in their 2019 plans,"" Corbetta said. Many brands, he claims, told him an all-black issue wouldn't resonate with their audience.

He connects the issue to the fact that, in Brazil, discussing race and racism is still widely taboo. ""We never talk about apartheid. We didn't have a Martin Luther King. We didn't have a Rosa Parks. We didn't have an actual militant anti-racism movement. We have never talked about prejudice, even though it exists, so brands don't talk about it either.""

In this landscape, Brazil's black creatives -- like many marginalized groups around the world -- are increasingly turning to the internet and social media to create spaces for themselves in response to a lack of mainstream opportunity.

This was the route taken by Luiza Brasil, a Rio de Janeiro-based influencer and columnist for the Brazilian edition of Glamour. In 2015, she created Mequetrefismos, an online fashion, beauty and lifestyle publication, to promote the work of black people working within those fields; and, as a curator for the Casa Ipanema lifestyle boutique in Rio, has brought brands runs by black women to the forefront.

""We see more black people featured on magazine covers and in advertisements for luxury stores, but who are the people behind these campaigns? (The fact that they are usually white) says a lot about the lack of black people in organizations and leadership roles,"" Brasil said in a WhatsApp message. ""The black population is in the majority -- at 54% -- but our narratives have always been constructed by white people.""

""I think the Afro-Brazilian (empowerment) movement has always existed, but it's always been invisible. With the help of the internet, the Afro-Brazilian movement has gained momentum.""

Kevin David, a 25-year-old based in São Paulo, agrees. As executive creative director of MOOC , a Black-run creative collective, he's used the power of social media to land youth-oriented collaborative campaigns with the likes of Levi's, Converse, GQ Brazil and Schutz.

""There are fewer opportunities (for black creatives), but we are taking over. We have entered the market ... Weren't happy with the way the market was treating us,"" David said. ""We didn't want anyone else to tell our story. We wanted to take action and show that we believe representation means at this moment in Brazil.""

Brasil believes that the ongoing empowerment black creatives in the digital sphere will help challenge existing narratives and give Brazil more complex, diverse representations of black identity -- within Afro-Brazilian communities and in the mainstream.

""We no longer only represent an image of the ghetto, of blacks speaking only to blacks, but an important snapshot of society and our media in general"", she said.

How did Kim Jong Un get his Mercedes-Benzes? New report traces origin of North Korea's luxury rides,"Joshua Berlinger , CNN Written by

On June 14, 2018, two armored Mercedes-Maybach S600 Guard vehicles were shipped from the Dutch Port of Rotterdam, heading out on a journey that would take months and see the cars transported thousands of miles through six countries, according to a new report from the Washington-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS).

After stops in China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, the two cars -- each worth about $500,000 -- are believed to have been flown to their final destination, Pyongyang. And in the North Korean capital, there's only one customer who likely requires this type of ride.

The origin and journey of the two Mercedes luxury vehicles were exposed in the C4ADS report. CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.

Sanctions passed by the United Nations as punishment for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development are supposed to bar companies and individuals from selling luxury goods to North Korea.

C4ADS found that North Korea imported at least $191 million worth of luxury goods from 2015 to 2017, sourced from ""as many as 90 countries"" in violation of United Nations sanctions. Definitive figures are difficult to determine because there isn't a shared definition of what constitutes a ""luxury item"" and due to the surreptitious way North Korea imports such items.

The Mercedes-Maybach S600, however, is undoubtedly luxurious. It's equipped with leather massaging seats and armor to protect occupants from steel-core ammo fired from assault rifles and from explosive devices, according to Car and Driver.

Kim is usually seen being chauffeured in what's believed to be a Mercedes-Maybach Pullman Guard armored limousine, which carries a price tag upwards of $1 million. It's believed that was the vehicle his security escort ran alongside of during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last year.

Kim was also spotted with a Rolls-Royce last year

Daimler, the company that owns Mercedes, told CNN it ""has no indication on how the mentioned vehicles were delivered and where they come from.""

""Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with EU and US embargoes. To prevent deliveries to North Korea and to any of its embassies worldwide, Daimler has implemented a comprehensive export control process, which we consider appropriate and effective and which meets all requirements of the export control authorities,"" the company said in a statement to CNN.

""Sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility. We always investigate the vehicles displayed on the photos in the media thoroughly. However, without the vehicle identification numbers it is impossible to find a concrete trace.""

C4ADS concluded that North Korea maintains a complex, constantly evolving series of schemes in order to obtain luxury goods, like Kim's cars, to get around global export controls. The report concluded Pyongyang has imported 803 luxury vehicles from 2015 to 2017, with the majority originating from Russian companies.

""Not only are they continuing to use techniques that have been successful in disrupting traditional enforcement, but they're also sort of watching how we're tracking them and developing much more sophisticated techniques to continue to evade sanctions,"" said Jason Arterburn, a co-author of the C4ADS paper.

Lucas Kuo, another one of the report's co-authors, told CNN C4ADS' investigation aimed to ""evaluate what were the deficiencies within the international system that allowed this activity to continue?""

Eight months of investigating

Kuo said it took himself and the report's co-authors eight months of investigating how Kim was able allegedly to obtain the Benzes. They scoured customs records, shipping data, bills of lading and other open-source documents to trace how the vehicles made their way from Rotterdam to Pyongyang.

""We think we built a pretty compelling case to say that these Mercedes were likely bound for North Korea,"" he said.

CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.

Kuo and his co-authors concluded that the two Mercedes left Rotterdam for Dalian, then made their way on to Osaka, Japan, and Busan, South Korea. From South Korea, they were shipped out on a vessel called the DN5505, per the bill of lading.

That's when the journey gets murky. Shortly after the DN5505 left South Korea, it reported via its AIS system -- a way to locate ships at sea -- that its intended destination was the Russian city of Nakhodka, where it was estimated to arrive on October 5, according to C4ADS.

However, the ship's AIS data stopped pinging locations from October 1 to 19, according to the report. Though AIS transponders do not ping when ships are far at sea, they could have been turned off -- a common tactic used by ships breaking sanctions law, experts say.

When the DN5505's transponder turned back on, the ship was spotted near where it originally disappeared, according to C4ADS, but this time heading in the opposite direction back to Busan. On November 2, the vessel submitted a bill of lading to South Korean customs authorities that showed the ship was transporting anthracite coal allegedly from Nakhodka. But in Nakhodka, ""no record exists"" of the DN5505's arrival, C4ADS said.

CNN has reached out to the Port of Nakhodka authorities for comment on the report.

Back in Russia, on October 7 -- two days after the estimated arrival time of the DN5505 -- three Ilyushin-76 cargo jets operated by North Korea's state-run airline reportedly traveled from Pyongyang to Vladivostok. Those jets are often used to transport armored vehicles used by North Korea's elites, and are rarely spotted in in Vladivostok, C4ADS said.

""When asked for comment, the North Korean consulate in Vladivostok reportedly did not provide an explanation for the unscheduled flights on October 7,"" C4ADS said in its report.

""We have not uncovered direct evidence that the overlapping visits of the cargo jets and the DN5505 to the Russian Far East are related. However, given the heavy lift cargo capacity of the planes and their role in transporting Kim Jong Un's armored limousines, it is possible that the cargo jets could have loaded the Mercedes,"" the C4ADS report said.

Dual use

While cracking down on luxury goods may not hurt North Korea as much as going after its valuable coal exports, identifying those who allegedly helped Kim get his cars could close off some loopholes, said George Lopez, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, which is charged with monitoring sanctions enforcement and efficacy.

C4ADS also claims that understanding how North Korea smuggles luxury goods could provide useful information to law enforcement attempting to stop Pyongyang's from obtaining more dangerous items with military or nuclear applications.

""North Korea acquires high-end luxury goods through the same overseas smuggling networks as other contraband. As a result, their detection and seizure could be a means to drive action against the Kim regime's core procurement operations,"" the report found.

""High-end luxury goods share key features with dual-use goods for North Korea's weapons program: they are scarce, specialized products with high monetary value and great symbolic importance for the Kim regime.""

Ryugyong Hotel: The story of North Korea's 'Hotel of Doom',"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

In 1987, ground was broken on a grand new hotel in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. The pyramid-shaped, supertall skyscraper was to exceed 1,000 feet in height, and was designed to house at least 3,000 rooms, as well as five revolving restaurants with panoramic views.

The Ryugyong Hotel -- named after a historical moniker for Pyongyang meaning ""capital of willows"" -- was supposed to open just two years later. But it never did.

While the structure reached its planned height in 1992, it stood windowless and hollow for another 16 years, its naked concrete exposed, like a menacing monster overlooking the city. During that time the building, which dwarfs everything around it, earned itself the nickname ""Hotel of Doom.""

The hotel has since been clad in metal and glass, and was later fitted with LED lights to turn it into a colorful nighttime spectacle. Construction work has started and stopped many times, fueling constant speculation over whether it will ever open to guests.

Still closed to this day, the Ryugyong Hotel is the world's tallest unoccupied building.

A Cold War pawn

The Ryugyong Hotel was a product of the Cold War rivalry between US-supported South Korea and the Soviet-backed North. The year before construction commenced, a South Korean firm had built what was then the world's tallest hotel, the Westin Stamford in Singapore. The South's capital Seoul was meanwhile getting ready to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, with the country transitioning to a capitalist democracy.

As part of North Korea's political response to the South's achievements, Pyongyang organized the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students, a sort of socialist version of the Olympics. The country planned to build the massive hotel just in time for the event, stealing the world record away from the South.

But due to engineering problems it wasn't finished in time for the festival. The government had already poured billions into the event, building a new stadium, expanding Pyongyang's airport and paving new roads. That put a strain on the hermit state's frail economy, while the Soviet Union's collapse left it deprived of vital aid and investment.

North Korea was bound for an economic crisis. Although the external structure had been completed, construction was halted in 1992 and a crane was abandoned on top of the building.

A concrete structure

The building consists of three wings, each sloped at a 75-degree angle, converging into a cone encasing the top 15 floors, which are intended for restaurants and observation decks.

The pyramidal shape is about more than aesthetics -- it's because the Ryugyong, unusually for a skyscraper, is made of reinforced concrete rather than steel.

""It was built like this because the upper levels needed to be lighter,"" said Calvin Chua, a Singapore-based architect who has extensively researched Pyongyang's urbanism, in a phone interview. ""They didn't have advanced construction materials, so it was built entirely in concrete. You can't achieve a slender tower that way, you need to have a massive base with a tapered top.

""If you look at the history of construction in North Korea since the end of the Korean War, most of the buildings are made of concrete: That's the material that they are familiar with, and the technology transfer between Soviet or communist states is purely based around concrete.""

According to Chua, who has worked in North Korea with local architects, the Ryugyong may have been designed to look like a mountain, not a pyramid, because mountains play an important role in the country's symbolism. The official biography of Kim Jong Il, the deceased father of current ruler Kim Jong Un, states that he was born in a secret military camp on Mount Paektu, the tallest mountain in the Korean peninsula that is depicted in the national emblem of North Korea. (Many historians believe Kim Jong Il was actually born in Russia.)

""It's a very iconic building, but I think it's important to consider where it sits in relation to the entire city fabric of Pyongyang,"" said Chua. ""It's like a sort of obelisk. If you think of the obelisk in Rome's St. Peter's Square, it provides a [beacon] for the city apart from its symbolism. The Ryugyong is similar, but it's also more symbolically defined.""

A second start

In 2008, after a 16-year pause, construction unexpectedly resumed, as part of a deal with Orascom, an Egyptian conglomerate that was contracted to build North Korea's 3G network.

The rusty old crane that had stood atop the building for two decades was finally removed . Workers aided by Egyptian engineers installed glass and metal panels to the concrete structure at the cost of $180 million, glazing it completely and giving the building a polished, sleek appearance. The project, completed in 2011, fueled speculation about the hotel's opening. In late 2012, German luxury hotel group Kempinski announced that the Ryugyong would partially open under its management in mid-2013, but then pulled out a few months later, stating that entering the market was ""not currently possible.""

Long-standing rumors that the building was structurally unsound due to poor construction techniques and materials gained strength once again. In 2014, a 23-story apartment building collapsed in Pyongyang because construction was ""not done properly,"" according to North Korean state media reports.

""Judging from the exterior, the building looks structurally sound, although the interior may be a different story,"" said Chua. ""I think the real problem might be the ease of fitting it out, because it was built with concrete and it would take a lot of time to rewire the necessary services and ventilation systems that were originally created to 1980s specifications. That would be much easier with a steel structure.""

Photographs of the hotel's interior from 2012 revealed that, inside, very little work had been done. The images were taken by Simon Cockerell, general manager at Koryo Group, a Beijing-based company specializing in North Korea tours, and one of the very few foreigners to have been inside the Ryugyong Hotel.

""It was arranged through a Korean connection as a birthday gift for me,"" he said in a phone interview. ""First of all, we had a presentation from the director of the site, with videos made quite a long time ago. Then they took us into the lobby area, where there was a lot of exposed cement. Then we went (on) the one working elevator to the top, which was the 99th floor, I believe.

""It took a long time to get there, because it was a service elevator, not a modern lift with a string of buttons. There was a lift operator who determined where to stop. At the top we had a look around, took some pictures and went back down to the lobby again.""

Although its external appearance had been transformed, the Ryugyong still wasn't open.

A brighter future?

The Ryugyong came back to life in 2018, when LEDs were installed on its facade, turning the building into Pyonyang's biggest light show -- as well as a propaganda machine. A four-minute program shows North Korea's history and a variety of political slogans, while the cone at the top projects a huge North Korean flag.

""It's really striking the first time you see it, especially after so many years of the building sitting there in darkness,"" said Will Ripley, a CNN correspondent who has taken multiple trips to Pyongyang, in an email. ""I know they turn it on whenever there are major events in the city, but it's not on all the time -- I would assume to save scarce electricity.""

In recent years, extensive work has been carried out on the site surrounding the hotel, which was recently opened up, making it possible for anyone to walk right up to the front entrance (but not get in). In June 2018, a sign was added to the building, reading simply ""The Ryugyong Hotel"" in Korean and English.

The question remains: Will it ever open? ""It's very hard to say, because since the building was clad in glass, you can't see inside,"" said Cockerell. ""No doubt something's going on. It's a very large building. It's not inconceivable that some part of it may open before the whole of it could open. If it was my building, I'd focus on the top and the bottom.""

The Ryugyong Hotel is no longer the tallest building in the Korean peninsula: The Lotte World Tower in Seoul, completed in 2017, surpassed it by nearly 800 feet (240 meters). It is still the tallest in North Korea, although Pyongyang has seen a growth spurt of high-rise residential towers recently, with the tallest being just 197 feet (60 meters) shorter than the Ryugyong.

For years, to avoid embarrassment, the North Korean government has airbrushed the building from official pictures of Pyongyang. But the installation of the LED lighting may signal that there's a plan for its future.

""I think the North Korean government would definitely like to do something with it,"" said Ripley. ""For years, it was an embarrassing eyesore -- especially before the glass exterior was installed. I imagine if they do finish it, and Kim Jong Un makes an inspection and it's all over the state media, it will be more widely acknowledged as a proud centerpiece of the city.

""Personally, I think it would be fascinating to see what they do with the inside and go all the way to the top. I'm sure the views are extraordinary.""",
The man on the phone: What's it like making history's highest auction bid?,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

In November 2017 at Christie's New York, Alex Rotter uttered a phrase never before heard at an art auction: ""Four hundred million.""

His bid was in dollars, and the lot in question was the last known Leonardo da Vinci painting in private hands. Audible gasps gave way to applause, and, less than a minute later, the gavel fell to make history.

After fees, the ""Salvator Mundi"" sold for $450.3 million , obliterating auction records for a work of art.

But it wasn't Rotter who made the world-famous purchase -- it was the anonymous bidder on the end of his telephone line. In fact, he was just as surprised as anyone.

""I thought when we reached $200 million it would end,"" he recalled to CNN on the phone. ""Then I thought it would end when we reached $300 million... a natural stopping point.""

""It was really unclear how far the client would go. It was just (me saying), 'Do you want to?' I remember making sure that I -- that he -- was very clear about the bidding increments and what the next bid was.

""Normally I'd just say the next bid, but I remember clarifying it at 300 million. I said, 'It's $300 million, do you want to bid $300 million now?'

""At this level you can't mess up -- you can't (get it) wrong,"" he added.

It's a remarkably candid account, given how tight-lipped Christie's has remained about the historic sale. The auction house has consistently refused to discuss the bidder's identity, though it is widely believed to have been Saudi Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, acting on behalf of the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, better known as MbS.

The moment Leonardo da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi"" sold for $450 million.

""I had no recollection of time -- you could have told me it was two minutes,"" Rotter said of the 18-minute bidding war, adding: ""(It) was one of the most exciting moments that I've experienced in my 20 years of auctions.""

Art world matchmaker

Austrian-born Rotter, Christie's chairman of post-war and contemporary art, wouldn't be drawn on further details. But his recollections of other record-breaking sales paint a compelling picture of high drama and pressured decision-making.

His auction day role -- which the 45-year-old admits is ""quite stressful"" -- sees him telling telephone bidders what's happening in the room. This means relaying the auctioneer's words and price increments in real-time, as well as communicating details about potential rivals (revealing the identity of other phone bidders is, however, ""a big no-no,"" Rotter stressed).

Many of Rotter's interlocutors are long-term clients. So he's also on hand to offer advice -- how much similar artworks sold for, or how a bidding war might unfold. And then, by Rotter's own admission, there's an element of gentle encouragement. Auctioneering is a commissions business, after all (and the so-called ""buyer's premium"" at Christie's ranges from about 13% to 30% of the winning bid).

What might surprise those outside the art world, however, is that his wealthy clients don't always have a maximum price in mind -- even when it comes to multimillion-dollar paintings.

""I've heard people on the telephone say, 'Alex, let's just buy it, no matter how far it goes,' and I've heard people (say), 'I have a limit, and don't even ask me if we reach (it) because I don't want to be tempted,'"" revealed Rotter.

""People have different strategies for how to go about it. I do think people get carried away.

""Competition attracts everyone, and on auction night, you're in the bidding process and it's a little bit of a race. People don't like to lose.""

In recent years, Rotter has become a familiar sight in the so-called ""phone bank,"" the line of well-heeled go-betweens covering their mouths as they confer with anonymous buyers. Last November, he made another world record bid -- this time on behalf of an unidentified client pursuing David Hockney's ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)."" At $90.3 million, the sale marked the highest sum ever paid for the work of a living artist.

""Rabbit,"" by Jeff Koons, is now the most expensive artwork by a living artist to ever sell at auction. Credit: Courtesy Christie's

This record was broken again, just six months later, by Jeff Koons' $91.1-million ""Rabbit"" sculpture. And although Rotter wasn't on the winning client's side this time, he was nonetheless instrumental in bringing the artwork to auction.

Indeed, despite his public-facing role, most of the Austrian's work happens in the weeks and months prior to a sale. As well as conceiving of auction themes and populating them with relevant works, he serves as something of an art-world matchmaker, filling gaps in collectors' portfolios and tracking down the world's most sought-after paintings.

'Dream of big numbers'

Identifying targets means knowing art intimately -- and seeing lots of it too. The journey to bring Koons' ""Rabbit"" to auction began with Rotter's personal encounter with the sculpture at the Newhouse Apartment gallery in New York at the beginning of the last decade: ""I remember saying to my colleagues, 'one day...'"" he recalled.

Even at the highest echelons of the art market, such instincts outweigh number-crunching. Data ""substantiates the intuition and gut feeling experts have,"" Rotter said.

Hailing from a family of Austrian art dealers, these instincts are, undoubtedly, finely tuned. He made his first sale, aged 13, at his mother's booth at a Vienna art and antiques fair, where he sold an early 19th-century porcelain cup and saucer for the equivalent of $1,000, and a watercolor by Austrian painter Rudolf von Alt for 10 times that.

""My mother had to help in the final round of negotiation as I didn't want to give more than a 10% discount and the guy insisted on more,"" he recalled. ""But I remember the feeling of closing a sale and it had me hooked.""

Thirty years on, closing deals is still the endgame. When desired artworks are identified, it's often Rotter's job to convince their owners to part company with them. Such discussions involve not only an item's valuation, but negotiations over fees and the size of the opening bid (""In an ideal world, you start lower than you think it would make, and then have it run"").

For the aforementioned Hockney painting, whose owner Christie's courted for a year and a half, it was a case of making them ""dream of big numbers,"" as Rotter recalled.

""People who own $80 million paintings are (going) to be savvy and smart. They didn't just sign on the dotted line. They made it competitive. So, after us, they also went to the other auction houses and asked them for opinions, values, pitches.

""There was some price resistance,"" he added, ""Hockney's world record (at the time) was $25 million, and here was a painting that was expected to sell for $80 million.""

But while Rotter estimates that bidding usually starts between 30% and 50% of the expected price, the Hockney auction opened low, at just $20 million -- a quarter of Christie's top estimate. The gamble paid off, as bids soared past $90 million.

""At the end of the day, we got our result by starting low and tempting (bidders) ... so it worked out beautifully.""

Market pressures

With collectors increasingly shopping for art on Instagram and looking beyond Western marketplaces for returns, there are plenty of challenges facing European auction houses.

In July, research firm ArtTactic reported that Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips had posted a collective 20.3% year-on-year drop in sales in the first half of 2019. Indeed, if it weren't for the $450 million auction of the ""Salvator Mundi"" in 2017, and Peggy and David Rockefeller's huge $832 million private art collection in 2018, then both of these years might have been considered disappointing for Christie's, too.

This recent dip may not concern an auction market known for its volatility. For all the ups and downs of the last decade, global auction sales in 2018 were, at $29.1 billion, slightly above 2008 levels, according to Art Basel and UBS' authoritative Global Art Market Report

But sales of art and antiques online -- whether from auction houses' websites or internet retailers -- have exploded, almost doubling between 2013 and 2018. Online transactions may represent a small chunk of the art market, at $6 billion, but growth looks set to continue. Generation Z collectors are more than twice as likely than their millennial or generation X counterparts to prefer buying art on the internet, the same report found.

With their wood-paneled rooms, corded telephones and paper catalogs, the old auction houses of New York and London appear increasingly antiquated. Nonetheless, Christie's is adapting to the digital age -- more than 250 years after its founding. Last year, it hosted 88 web-only auctions, and generated online sales of $250 million (up by more than 16% from 2016, the year Rotter arrived from arch rival Sotheby's).

It's still a brick-and-mortar business. But Rotter is confident that his employer -- now owned by French billionaire François Pinault -- can use heritage to its advantage.

""There is obviously something very traditional, something charming about (auctions) -- that it's still wooden benches (and) telephones,"" he said. ""There's obviously a digital technology revolution going on in the auction business. A lot of the transactions happen online now. (But) the spectacle of the evening sale stays the same.

""People like to dress up; they like to come to the auction or to participate in it somehow,"" he added. ""It's serious art we're selling, but it's still an event.""

Moreover, he depicts big-ticket auctions as being uniquely democratic -- great levelers through which an artwork's market value emerges in real-time. Or as Rotter put it: ""Who bids the most gets the painting. There's no trickery, there's no advantage for someone who comes first or has a bigger name. That's the beauty of it.""

When it comes to the art itself, however, bigger names command bigger prices. So which painting is the holy grail of the market -- the one artwork his clients all want but can't have?

""There are a handful of objects,"" Rotter said. ""I'm not talking about pieces that are hanging in MoMA or the Metropolitan Museum, because they will never be obtainable. But there is (always) one object that still sits in a private collection -- this one Van Gogh, this one Warhol, this one Koons -- that everyone wants.

""Obviously, I have this list in my office. It lives there -- I know it by heart -- with little thumbnail images.

""You always try,"" he concluded, adding: ""Always shoot for the masterpieces.""

Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"Written by Aileen Kwun, CNN Contributors Oscar Holland, CNN Stephy Chung, CNN

Last month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide ""momentum"" for its ""existing diversity and inclusion approach.""

The move marked Chanel's entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.

About two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to ""create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity."" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.

These announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry's response to accusations that it's out of touch with customers and society at large.

These missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry's noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci's turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G's ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.

Hiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion's troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.

Teen Vogue's fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , ""why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?""

Another user wrote: ""white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn't a POC @CHANEL.""

In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter's appointment ""is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.""

The brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.

From the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?

Fashion's new watchdogs

With designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.

Fashion's watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.

Take the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million ""Dieters"") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G's self-inflicted woes.

Social media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.

But controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

The industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, ""and in the 1920s and '30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown"" in marketing materials. ""It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.""

Meanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw ""coolie"" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior's ""New Look"" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.

Sales of the YSL perfume ""Opium"" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent's name, which many felt trivialized China's painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.

""We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,"" Steele said in a phone interview. ""How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G's ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It's absolutely absurd.""

While the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana's alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.

""The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,"" Steele added. ""Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.""

Why brands miss the mark

Whether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.

This is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.

Here, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as ""creepy"" by social media users.

Fashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.

This raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.

Former Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like Chloé, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.

She believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.

""These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what's going on globally.

""With China and Western countries, there's a big gap,"" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. ""Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That's something most people outside of China wouldn't understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.""

Tapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences' cultures. She cited the Hermès-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country's traditional craftsmanship.

More than money

There is clearly no shortage of money at Europe's biggest fashion houses, and China's rise as the world's fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.

The D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience's culture isn't a matter of money, according to Steele.

Dolce & Gabbana forced to cancel show in China

If more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. ""Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn't enough,"" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and ""in a position that isn't threatened or penalized for speaking up.""

""You can't just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,"" she said. ""You really have to have diversity in terms of who's in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.""

Steele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion's upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.

And the industry's problematic lack of diversity isn't just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.

""Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you're getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,"" said Steele.

""On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.""

This pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.

""Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,"" she said in a phone interview. ""In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.""

Steps toward accountability

Brands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.

In January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.

""The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country's diversity in its workforce across all levels,"" the briefing stated. ""It's crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.""

As the report articulated, diversity is ""simply a measure of difference"" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating ""a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole."" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.

The current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion's ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.

The industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.

Remedies will take time, and the CFDA's report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.

While no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada's blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will ""elevate voices of color.""

And when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund ""to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)

Burberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.

But they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry's wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.

Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak,"Zunar and Fahmi Reza's art was a boon to protesters sick of the alleged corruption of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, but it nearly landed the two men in prison.

For Malaysians, the figure pictured is instantly recognizable as Rosmah Mansor, wife of disgraced former Prime Minister Najib Razak and -- according to prosecutors in the US and Malaysia -- a modern day Imelda Marcos who accrued luxury goods worth millions of dollars using money embezzled from the state investment fund, 1MDB.

Also instantly recognizable is the artist behind the picture, which has pride of place at an exhibition in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur. Political cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Haque, better known as Zunar, has spent most of the last decade lampooning Najib and Rosmah, even as the risks for doing so grow ever greater.

Zunar's work welcomes visitors to ""Democracy in Action,"" a recent exhibition that would have been impossible to stage only a year ago. In one cartoon, a hand holding chopsticks marked ""China"" reaches over to pluck Malaysia off a platter marked ""1MDB scandal."" In another, a huge diamond ring, a handbag and a bag of cash come together, Transformers-style, to form an image of Rosmah.

At the center sits Zunar's motto: ""How can I be neutral ... even my pen has a stand.""

That motto has been severely tested in recent times. Just last year, it seemed almost certain that Zunar would end up in prison. A number of his books had been banned, and while his work was still widely shared online, the artist faced multiple charges of sedition and committing acts deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy."" Unknown assailants attacked him at a gallery show, police seized his works and he was banned from leaving the country.

Then, in a shock election result, a coalition of opposition parties turfed Najib out of office, promising to clamp down on corruption and reverse the country's turn toward authoritarianism.

Now Zunar is watching as his the political figures who were once his nemeses and muses face decades behind bars themselves -- in part because artists like him helped bring attention to their alleged corruption and disdain for the rule of law.

""The medium of cartooning is (a) very powerful medium,"" Zunar told CNN at his small studio in a Kuala Lumpur suburb. ""Everywhere, in any country you go, (cartoonists) get killed. Cartoonists, get arrested, put in jail everywhere because of the medium.""

Fellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.

""Using satire and humor is effective because it breaks the fear barrier,"" he said in a phone interview.

""People had always been afraid to speak out. The culture of fear is always there; the culture of self-censorship is always there. That's where satire and humor can be the most effective tool, it makes people less afraid.""

Cartoonist's muse

After a number of false starts, Zunar's career as a political cartoonist was flagging when his nemesis emerged on the political scene in the 1990s.

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Najoib's wife Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Credit: Zunar

In many ways, the artist's career trajectory rose in tandem with that of Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers who climbed quickly through the ranks of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, initially as deputy prime minister and then to the premiership itself in 2009.

As Najib's star grew, so did the frustration of his critics. Detractors delighted in seeing him brought back down to Earth by Zunar's increasingly exaggerated, grotesque portrayals.

More even than Najib however, Zunar found his muse in Rosmah. He did, however, face more difficulty publishing cartoons of her, versus those of the Prime Minister.

""When my book came out with Najib on the cover, I could at least release it,"" Zunar said. When Rosmah was the subject however, ""the police came and stopped the launch ... (from this) we can understand that maybe that she is more powerful.""

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When police raided the couple's properties in Kuala Lumpur last year, they seized jewelry and gemstones worth over $109 million. Around $13 million worth of Hermès handbags were also confiscated, along with cash and other goods totaling over $100 million.

Many of the items were, allegedly, purchased with money embezzled from the 1MDB state investment fund, set up by Najib. Rosmah has pleaded not guilty, and due to numerous delays in the legal system, has yet to end up in court.

The 1MDB scandal -- and Rosmah's spending -- became a central theme of Zunar's work. In particular, the artist sought to make a connection between the allegedly embezzled funds and the Malaysian people: One cartoon showed Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal's waste.

""Zunar has such a finely developed sense of what is right and what is fair,"" said Robert Russell, executive director of the Cartoonists Rights Network International. ""Like any good political cartoonist he has this well-developed sense of righteous indignation.""

Russell said Zunar's cartoons were so effective, in part, because they undercut concerted efforts by the government to present itself, particularly overseas, as a legitimate and clean administration. Using a combination of journalism and art, Zunar highlighted the instances where this was not the case.

But doing so would ultimately endanger his freedom, as Najib's government took a hard authoritarian turn in an attempt to stifle criticism.

Clowning around

Beginning in 2010, Zunar was questioned multiple times under the Sedition Act , a colonial-era law widely denounced by human rights groups as draconian.

In 2016, he was charged with taking actions deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy"" over a series of cartoons depicting government corruption. Police seized hundreds of his books, and unknown assailants attacked him at an exhibition.

Later that year, Zunar was slapped with a travel ban after he visited Geneva to accept the Cartooning for Peace Award. The ban, according to free-speech group IFEX, ""appear(ed) to be an attempt to damp down the growing international publicity (surrounding) Zunar and his work.""

Zunar was not the only artist to face blowback for satirizing Najib. In June 2016, Fahmi Reza was charged with two counts of violating section 233(1) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, which forbids disseminating online content deemed to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass others.

Fahmi had depicted Najib as a clown with big red lips and arched, thick eyebrows. The image quickly caught on with Malaysians sick of the widespread allegations of corruption, and it soon became a common sight at anti-government protests.

Like Zunar, Fahmi had a record of trouble with the authorities. In 2004 , he designed a poster for a demonstration against police brutality, and volunteered to help print and distribute leaflets and other materials.

Unfortunately for him, Fahmi's conscientiousness was his downfall. Arriving ahead of most other protesters, police saw him with a large number of posters and banners. He was quickly arrested.

""I panicked and I was afraid,"" Fahmi told CNN. ""But I think surviving that made me bolder, knowing that the poster I made was having an effect on these people who abused their power.""

When he was arrested again in 2016, Fahmi was ""fully prepared,"" he said.

""One sign that whatever you're doing is effective is when the authorities and people in power react,"" he added. ""If they ignore it, then there's no impact. That's how the whole clown thing became a symbol of protest -- because of the overreaction by the authorities.""

Satire as a weapon

Both cartoonists' arrests made international headlines, helping to highlight Najib's growing authoritarianism to the outside world. Protesters also delighted in using the caricatures of Najib and Rosmah on posters and placards after it was revealed how much the artists had irritated them.

As Malaysia's opposition grew ever more determined to oust Najib -- with many observers warning that 2016's general election might be their last chance to do so -- the government passed new legislation to control what people could say about it.

In early 2018, it introduced a new law to crack down on ""fake news"" that critics said was so broadly defined that it could easily be used to shut down and criminalize criticism of Najib.

Eventually however, the wave of dissent was too great for Najib to overcome. Even though the electoral map was redrawn in his favor, he lost heavily. With an 82.32% turnout, an opposition coalition led by current Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad took 121 of 222 seats. Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition won just 79.

Uncertain future

Since Najib's downfall, charges against Zunar and Fahmi have been dropped, though the latter is still fighting to have an earlier conviction overturned.

Both men said that, while they felt considerably freer under the new government, true reform has yet to be delivered.

""(The government is) more tolerant toward online dissent and criticism -- and even insults,"" Fahmi said, despite the fact that the ""online content"" law used to prosecute him is still on the books.

""People know it's still there, so I think some people are still afraid to voice their criticism openly,"" Fahmi said.

Zunar said the new government's most important task is to ""repair the damage"" done by previous regimes. He is willing to give them time to do so, but as for the future, ""we don't know yet.""

Russell, of Cartoonists Rights Network International, said Zunar faces a situation similar to that of other dissident cartoonists when their former oppressors leave office.

In the last year of Najib's rule, Zunar was banned from leaving the country. Credit: Zunar

""Even with Zunar's heroes ... now in a new government, he's going to start drawing the same cartoons about them,"" he said. ""This is not necessarily a happy ending. If Zunar is true to his roots, he will be as ruthless with the new government as any (other) government.

In the short term, Zunar is facing a more pressing concern: the loss of his muse, Rosmah.

While she has largely disappeared from Malaysia's political scene while her husband attempts to reinvent himself as a man-of-the-people government critic, the former prime minister's wife remains present inside Zunar's studio, her cartoon face staring up from numerous books and picture frames.

""I miss Rosmah,"" the artist said. ""For me, she was a god send. Very easy to draw, very cartoonable. Her character is very cartoonable.

""As a cartoonist, I miss her. When Trump goes one day, American cartoonists will miss him too.""",
The designers changing the conversation around lingerie,"Written by Jessica Rapp, CNN

For decades, padded push-up bras, lace-lined bodysuits and slim, voluptuous Victoria's Secret models have shaped public perceptions of what ""sexy"" looks like. But a growing number of lingerie brands are responding to discontent from consumers who want to see themselves better represented.

From offering a wider range of cup sizes and ""nude"" shades, to celebrating diversity in campaigns and on runways, intimate apparel labels are selling more than bras. They're selling inclusivity, too.

Lingerie is set to become a $59 billion market globally by 2024, up from $38 billion in 2017, according to Zion Market Research. And as sales grow, tastes also appear to be shifting.

Sales figures published by retail technology firm, Edited, suggest that bralettes and sports bras are increasingly preferred to cleavage-enhancing push-up bras. Victoria's Secret may still lead the pack with a reported 24% market share in the US, but it recently announced plans to shutter more than 50 stores following slow holiday season sales.

The closures come amid growing competition from newer brands, many of which are catering to broader tastes. Customers are embracing lingerie that encompasses alternative forms of sex appeal, and increasingly buying from brands that prioritize body positivity, comfort and proper fit.

Sizing up

Independent labels, like US startup ThirdLove, have filled a gap in the market by serving women who struggle to find bras in the right size. When Heidi Zak co-founded the brand in 2011, she simply wanted to provide bras that fit better than those at her previous go-to store, Victoria's Secret.

Using 600 million data points across metrics including breast shape and cup fit, ThirdLove promotes half-cup sizes. Today, the online-only brand offers 78 different sizes -- and is worth an estimated $750 million, according to Forbes

The unseen history of underwear

But offering more sizes can be an expensive endeavor. The inflexibility of factory production makes it difficult to cater to everyone, according to Cora Harrington, author of the book ""In Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear, and Love Lingerie.""

""There are so many parts to a bra, sizes and variations to breasts, that it's impossible for any one brand to service every single bra-wearing customer adequately,"" she said in a phone interview.

According to Harrington, who also founded the Lingerie Addict blog, a single bra can contain at least 20 individual components, including lace, closures and straps. For a luxury garment, this number can swell to 40 or 50, she said.

Add the precision sewing and pattern-making required to adjust for different sizes, then piece everything together, and it can create a product that costs more than ""what people feel is appropriate to pay for a bra.""

""(To) serve an adequate range of people,"" Harrington added, ""you're looking at 50 to 60 sizes to start, which is far beyond what most indie designers or new brands are able to afford.

""Consumer expectations are a little bit misaligned with product design and development ... people are used to fast-fashion cycles (and seeing) something on a runway, then seeing a knock-off two weeks later.""

Some lingerie makers have nonetheless found ways to profitably expand their size ranges, contributing to what Harrington calls a ""bra size war."" Rihanna's Savage X Fenty, for instance, produces lingerie for plus-size body types (up to 3X and 44DDD) in addition to straight sizes, with other labels going up to 46H or higher.

Diverse customers

The growing lingerie market is providing greater choice to another group of customers it has traditionally underserved: transgender shoppers.

Montreal-based Origami Customs offers gender-affirming lingerie to transgender customers, among others. With trans visibility at an all-time high, the brand has doubled sales over the last four years, according to founder Rae Hill.

The label has recently expanded its line of binders, an undergarment used to flatten the chest, that it models on transmasculine customers. Gaffs, a type of underwear used for tucking, make up nearly half of the products that Origami Customs sells.

""I've felt an outpouring of gratitude from my customers (especially trans women) about the affirming process of working with me,"" Hill said in an email interview.

""I take the time to work with each customer one-on-one, and I do feel that this creates a level of safety and intimacy that isn't available in the mainstream market.""

""Being sexy is as different as each one of us,"" Hill added.

Racial diversity is also a growing force in the lingerie market. Take Rihanna's aforementioned label, which has been praised for producing a variety of ""nude"" tones for different skin colors. Similarly, ThirdLove's recent line of T-shirt bras offers nine shades of ""naked.""

Before either of them, London-based disruptor Nubian Skin became one of the first brands to offer nude tones for women of color when it launched in 2014.

""We saw a lot of brands debut their own nude tones in the years immediately after the launch of Nubian Skin,"" Harrington said. ""Some of those brands have since rolled back (their selection) because they didn't market them very well -- if you're going to sell nude tone bras in deeper skin tones, it would help to use models of color.

""I hope that, for these companies (new brands like ThirdLove and Savage X) it's not a trend (but) something they plan to stick with.""

A matter of representation

Inclusivity isn't just about selling lingerie to diverse customers -- it's about doing so visibly. This means using models of all shapes, sizes and colors in fashion shows and campaigns.

Take Lonely Lingerie, for instance, which claims to portray women in a realistic way by refusing to use Photoshop -- or even hair and makeup stylists -- in its campaigns. The brand's models include women with 35 different bra sizes and from a variety of backgrounds.

Founder Helene Morris said that, when she started the label in 2009, ""there was no one in the lingerie world who was speaking in a way we related to at all."" Her brand's ""Lonely Girls"" project featured senior models, breastfeeding mothers, pregnant women and disabled women, all photographed in natural light.

""We really wanted to give the power ... to the person being shot -- how they want to be shot, how are they most comfortable and involving the woman in that process,"" Morris said in a phone interview.

Plus-size label Curvy Couture also sees the use of diverse models as an important step towards inclusivity, according to social media marketing manager, Summer Rose.

""We have a ton of fit models that come in -- different sizes, different ages, moms who are post-breastfeeding -- just so we can really make sure that the fit is supportive,"" she said in a phone interview. ""No matter what stage in life she is in, we want to make sure she feels her best.""",
"Ceiling fans, brooms and mangoes: The election symbols of India's political parties","Written by Manveena Suri, CNN Oscar Holland, CNN

A ceiling fan, a bungalow, a broom and a mango -- these are just some of unusual symbols Indian voters can expect to see on their ballots as they head to the polls over the coming weeks.

An array of minimalist -- and often hand-drawn -- logos feature alongside candidates' names on electronic voting machines across India during its general election, the world's largest democratic exercise. The symbols help the dozens of participating parties to differentiate themselves from one another, while making it easier for voters to make their choice in a country where around a quarter of the population is illiterate.

But although it's common for party symbols to represent values or ideologies, India's system differs in an important way: Rather than designing logos themselves, parties must instead choose from a pre-existing list controlled by election officials.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) currently maintains a pool of thousands of symbols. The images represent aspects of everyday life in India, from a stack of tires and a gramophone, to an auto rickshaw and even a cricket player.

Parties must choose three symbols, in order of preference, after which they are allocated one by the ECI. Once an image is ""reserved,"" it cannot be used by any other party, leaving new entrants to pick from a list of ""free"" symbols.

Easy to recognize

Hundreds of logos have been allocated going into this month's elections, which will see the country select candidates for the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, alongside a number of state-level polls.

There are, currently, a further 200 unclaimed images, according to a list published by the ECI last month. Among the logos still up for grabs are an air conditioning unit, a tube of toothpaste and a vacuum cleaner.

Many of the symbols are, in fact, the work of a single artist: M. S. Sethi, who for decades served as a draftsman for the ECI.

First hired in the 1950s, as India organized its first post-independence elections, Sethi would sit with officials as they discussed everyday objects that could be easily remembered and identified by voters. He reportedly sketched his early symbols in pencil.

Sethi retired from the commission in the 1990s, although many of his designs remain in -- or available for -- use. New images reflecting contemporary life have also been added to the list, including a phone charger and a USB pen drive.

Campaign devices

These seemingly simple logos can be crucial campaigning tools. They are visible across India during election time -- on banners, billboards, pamphlets and other materials -- as political groups vie for voters' attention.

But although parties use designs allocated to them, many have, over the years, become synonymous with their symbols.

Take the lotus, for instance, which denotes current Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Or the raised, open-palmed hand that serves as a visual calling card for the main opposition, the Indian National Congress (INC).

In both instances, party symbols have evolved to possess significant political capital -- as evidenced by the wrangling that has occurred during internal party divisions. (When a split occurs within a party, the ECI decides which faction can continue using its symbol, with breakaway parties forced to return to the list of available images).

World's tallest statue unveiled in India

Between 1952 and 1969, the Congress was represented by a pair of bulls pulling a yoke. A series of internal ruptures mean that today, when voters who wish to vote for the INC enter the polling booth, they'll have to look for the raised palm.

The changes result from internal splits dating back to the late 1960s, and the current symbol did not come into common use until the late 1970s.

The BJP, meanwhile, traces its origins back to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh party, which, from 1955 to 1977, used an oil lamp as its logo. In 1977, the group merged with other parties to form the Janata Party, adopting a farmer and plough as its new symbol.

Three years later, the Janata Party was dissolved and its members established what is today known as the BJP. It was allocated a lotus symbol, which the party continues to use to this day.",
The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars,"Written by Rhonda Garelick, CNN

This article was originally published in August 2018.

Sometimes, fashion's greatest power is its stealth -- its ability to turn up in unlikely places, on unlikely people, and in the smallest details. Consider the case of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the 85-year-old force of nature who sits on the Supreme Court.

Ginsburg learned long ago how to stand out. Forging her distinguished career at a time when women were not seen as appropriate candidates for law school, let alone judgeships, Ginsburg succeeded in being taken seriously, in remaining visible. And she has devoted herself to helping others do the same: advocating for those society tends to overlook, those ""disappeared"" by the blindness of prejudice or sexism.

Today, as a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg continues to stand out -- literally, visually -- by virtue of the decorative collars that she famously affixes to her judicial robes.

Beyond a feminizing touch

Given her historic position and stature -- she's the second female justice, appointed in 1993 -- you might think that Ginsburg would have little need for such sartorial distinction. Yet, her collars make crucial symbolic points, albeit subtly.

In adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.

Beyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.

There is her favorite ""majority"" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her ""dissenting"" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg's opinions (to those court observers fluent in ""Ruth"") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her ""dissenting"" collar a day after President Donald Trump's election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).

When espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg's collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.

When worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been 'disappeared'.

But those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not ""wear"" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least""straight, white, male physicality) as we do women's. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as ""mind"" or ""spirit,"" while women represent the baser realms of ""body"" and ""flesh.""

Re-injecting the 'body' into judicial robes

To clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.

This risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.

Ginsburg's collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of ""body"" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.

To re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most ""noticeable"" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).

Ginsburg's collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.

And finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.

This has been literalized in cinemas screening the new documentary ""RBG"" (by Betsy West and Julie Cohen), where pasteboard silhouettes of Ginsburg's judicial robes -- complete with ornate collar -- have been set up. Moviegoers can pose for selfies in ""RBG drag,"" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: ""Imagine yourself here! This could be you!""

Of course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg's ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg's frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct when Ginsburg wore her ""dissenting"" collar.",
Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture,"Written by Aric Chen

Aric Chen is Lead Curator for Design and Architecture at M+ , the new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong.

Upon first seeing digital renderings of architect Liu Jiakun's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing -- a row of 38 steel rods pulled taut by cables, like fishing poles bearing a formidable catch -- many were struck by its audacious simplicity.

As a first foray outside Britain for the Serpentine Gallery's hugely successful series of temporary pavilions (they have previously been built in London's Kensington Park and designed by heavyweight architects like Zaha Hadid, Sou Fujimoto and Bjarke Ingels) one might have anticipated a bit more flamboyance. Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.

We should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he's based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum

But mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as ""low-tech,"" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.

""His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,"" said the Serpentine's artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.

Liu's buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural ""realism."" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China's return as a global power.

Centered on the Bird's Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture's power to represent and even shape a new epoch.

But as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them "" Rebirth Bricks "") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.

Shifting attitudes

A stone's throw from the Forbidden City, Liu's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird's Nest along the capital's historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.

Even the most perfunctory glance at China's ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.

Often small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.

""He's the right architect at the right time,"" the Serpentine Gallery's CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.

According to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of ""junzi,"" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow.

""I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,"" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. ""It's like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It's pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.""

Put another way, Liu's pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it's difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party's headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).

Nonetheless, naming Liu as the designer of Beijing's inaugural Serpentine Pavilion was an inspired choice. Less than 20 years ago, Liu had become one of the very first architects to open a private practice in post-reform China, joining a field that was previously monopolized by state design institutes.

The country's architecture has had some catching up to do. But it says something about recent years that now we speak not only about how far it has to go, but of how far it has come.",
Meet North Korea's art dealer to the West,"Written by Hannah Ritchie, CNN Pontassieve, Italy Contributors Muhammad Darwish

In a sleepy town in Tuscany, over 8,000 kilometers from Pyongyang, you can find one of the West's largest collections of North Korean art. The man behind the operation, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has been bringing North Korean artworks to Pontassieve -- a small commune just a stone's throw from Florence -- for over 10 years.

The pieces in his collection all come from the same Pyongyang art studio, Mansudae. With an estimated 4,000 employees, it is the largest state-run art house in North Korea -- and one of the largest art production centers in the world.

Cecioni formed his working relationship with Mansudae back in 2005, when, during an official tour of the country with an Italian orchestra, he asked to look at some North Korean art.

Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings.

""Once I was there, I said, 'I'm actually very interested in art -- do you have anything to show me?'"" Cecioni said in his studio. ""They brought me to Mansudae's studio. Nobody had ever heard of it (in) the West, so I asked them whether they would they be interested in doing some business in the West, and they said 'sure.'""

With over 1.2 million square feet of studio space, Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings made from semi-precious stones. Cecioni sells them all, with prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, depending on the size and detail of the work.

The best-sellers, he explained, have been hand-painted propaganda posters, which are the most affordable and have proven popular with art collectors.

Cecioni sells works from Mansudae for $300 to $7,000.

Cecioni said that dealing with the state-run art house has proven to be surprisingly easy. ""Doing business with North Korea is, in a way, very old fashioned,"" he said. ""They're very trustworthy. What they say, they do. And what you say, you have to do.""

How Cecioni imports the artworks -- some of which are over two meters wide -- is similarly straightforward: ""There is DHL in Pyongyang. So they are sent through DHL to us, and they arrive in five days,"" he said.

Sanctions taking effect

Beyond the world of art collectors, Mansudae is best known for large bronze statues, which can be found in African countries such as Namibia and Senegal.

The sale of these socialist-style statues has, however, come under scrutiny from the United Nations, which last year blacklisted the studio as part of tightening sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime. It is believed that the monuments were being paid for in cash or land, helping North Korea evade existing sanctions and take in millions of dollars in income.

Cecioni imports artworks from Pyongyang using DHL.

""This money is highly significant,"" the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Hugh Griffiths, told CNN in December 2017. ""We are looking at at least 14 African (UN) member states where Mansudae alone was running quite large construction operations.""

Cecioni only deals in two-dimensional art, claiming that Mansudae's statue business is separate from the studio's main operation -- despite being run under the same name.

""It's like a big art company, there are many branches,"" he said. ""The money they received from us essentially goes back into running the studio. The very large statues -- that's Mansudae, but it's so different from the other things they do. It's definitely a multi-million-dollar enterprise, so I'm sure there is some direction from the (state).""

Cecioni said last year's UN sanctions has affected his business, as he's no longer able to import North Korean art.

Despite Cecioni's convictions that the art he buys plays no significant role in generating income for the regime, his business was still impacted by last year's UN sanctions.

""The sanctions that are on Mansudae specifically -- I think they were not well placed,"" he said. ""I don't think they had the right perception of what Mansudae really is. They aimed at the statues, and they also hit the things we do, which are irrelevant for the economy of the country.""

Cecioni's ability to acquire new works has come to a sudden halt. ""The sanctions on my business have had a tremendous effect, because we cannot import anymore,"" he said.

Best-sellers, according to Cecioni, have been hand-painted propaganda posters.

But while the Italian is not bringing in any new artworks, he still has over 300 pieces in storage. Demand from international customers hasn't slowed, he said.

But instead of selling from his existing stockpile, Cecioni has begun rejecting sales, saying that the art has always been difficult to accurately value, and that he wants to keep the works he has on hand until he can start importing again.

""We are not really trying to sell anymore,"" he said, ""because we cannot replenish our inventory.""",
David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist,"David Hockney's home studio is set deep in the Hollywood Hills. We drive there from Sunset Boulevard, past sweeping views of the canyon below, 1920s Art Deco homes and modernist glass boxes perched at intervals on the hillside.

The ""English Angelino,"" as he sometimes refers to himself, lives in a corner house off the main road, just where the hill flattens out. A verdant, anonymous compound behind high gray fences, it's quiet, with no through traffic. With only a four-figure number on the door and a buzzer, there is no hint that this has, since 1979, been home to one of the world's most recognizable and popular artists.

We are buzzed in and directed up a short path to Hockney's studio, a building set aside from his home. From here, it is hard to make out his actual house, which is apparently a series of one- and two-story buildings -- bungalows almost -- enveloped in plants and shrubs. There are steps down, and somewhere tantalizingly out of sight is Hockney's famous swimming pool, a recurring subject in his paintings.

David Hockney at 80: A rare encounter with the artist

The studio -- a long, white, airy space with a staircase leading up to a gallery -- is a converted paddle tennis court. Upon entering, we see half a dozen or so works in progress. Hockney is preparing for a show at Pace Gallery in New York in April.

We hear him before we see him -- his hacking smoker's cough, to be precise. At 80 (and a half), Hockney is sitting in a favorite comfy armchair, reading the Financial Times. He peers up inquisitively through owlish glasses, before struggling up to greet us. He's wearing a blue and green striped cardigan (familiar to me from recent photos) and paint-spattered trousers, his once vibrantly dyed blonde hair now gray and thinning. He clutches a cigarette packet in one hand.

I'm little nervous at the beginning and don't want the interview to start before the cameras are ready to roll. We've arrived with three cameras to capture Hockney's every gesture, every laugh and every cigarette drag (he smokes three or four cigarettes during the interview).

“ I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years ... Every day I've done what I want to do. ” David Hockney

Making polite conversation, his assistant J.P. asks where I'm staying. I name a new boutique hotel on Sunset that he hasn't heard of. I complain about the lighting design in my room, which was so moodily dim that I couldn't find the bedside light switches. Evidently no one reads in bed these days -- the dominant fixture is a giant TV.

Hockney quickly interjects: ""Yes, they are just big voids,"" he says, referring to the TV screens. ""I don't like voids.""

Painting the pool

Hockney says that his swimming pool was also looking ""a bit like a void,"" so in the summer, the day before his 80th birthday, he had it drained so he could repaint the bottom himself with arcs of blue.

""Once it was painted, it made you see all the plants,"" he says. The job took him two and half hours, ""and that's how long it took me 20 years ago.""

Hockney's ex-lover, Gregory Evans, who lives next door and runs the business side of things for him, apparently questioned whether he was up to the job. ""Of course, I thought I could do it,"" he says a little defiantly.

He admits that he is stubborn, and you can sense a fierce willpower. He is not happy with the shade of blue -- it's ""a bit too pale"" -- and he may do it again. An hour or so later, after the interview is over, I politely ask if we can film his swimming pool. No, says Hockney -- ""Gregory wouldn't like it.""

A bigger retrospective

The pretext for our visit is Hockney's 80th birthday retrospective, which has already drawn well over a million visitors to London's Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

""I realize it is the last time (a retrospective) will be done in my lifetime,"" says Hockney. And that's the truth of it.

I ask him how this retrospective compares with the one in 1988 (around the time of his 50th birthday). ""Well,"" comes the blunt reply, ""it's 30 years later, 30 years more painting. A big difference, 30 years.""

We both laugh and I blush a little with embarrassment. It's arguably a stupid question, but there is also a feeling that Hockney wants his later work to receive the same attention that his paintings from the 1960s and 70s did.

Throughout the interview Hockney is his usual chatty, funny, contrary, bee-in-his-bonnet self. Naturally, he mentions smoking more than once -- ""Sixty-five years ago. I began smoking and they were called 'coffin nails' then.""

His father had been ""a big anti-smoker but (he died from) eating chocolate biscuits at 75. I'm five years older than him now,"" he says with a certain relish.

Fish and chips

Having first achieved success in his early 20s, Hockney has long been financially comfortable. But it seems that money never mattered that much to him, providing he has enough to run his studios.

He has always been generous by nature. I mention an early lithograph he gave away in 1954 -- the interior of a Yorkshire fish and chip shop with a 17-year-old art student, elbow on the counter, patiently waiting for his food to arrive.

""Yes I remember it. I remember drawing it on a lithographic stone they had at the art school in Bradford (in West Yorkshire).""

Hockney has astonishing recall. There were only ""about five copies,"" he says. I tell him that the copy that he gave to the shop's owners recently sold at auction for just under £19,000 ($27,000). Hockney shrugs; he's not remotely bothered. He's well aware that his work has risen hugely in value.

One of the first people to acquire Hockney's art was his friend and fellow student at London's Royal College of Art, the late R.B. Kitaj, in the early 1960s. Kitaj paid £5 ($7) for a drawing of a skeleton. ""That was quite a lot of money then,"" Hockney says, recalling being pleased that he was then able to buy cigarettes in packs of 20 rather than 10.

Hockney holds on to much of his own work, and has set up a foundation to look after it. I mention how much I admire his drawings of his mother, who died age 99 in 1999 (he painted her virtually every time he visited her). Hockney hints that he may exhibit them one day.

A gay pioneer

Hockney recalls the royal photographer, Cecil Beaton , purchasing one of his more sexually explicit paintings, ""Adhesiveness,"" for less than $60.

""I remember delivering it to his house,"" he tells me. ""He had it for 40 years."" The money helped pay for Hockney's first visit to New York in 1961.

We sometimes forget that, as a gay man in the public eye, Hockney was a pioneer of sorts -- an artist too honest not to paint his desires. Fresh out of college, he celebrated his sexuality through his work at a time when gay sex was still outlawed in England (it wasn't legalized until 1967). Those early pictures ""look rather good and stand up,"" he says.

'I feel 30 in the studio'

It's difficult to imagine Hockney not working. His work ethic is utterly engrained.

Hockney likes to paint in silence, ""to look, and look again."" Unlike Lucian Freud, for whom Hockney sat for a portrait for a total of 120 hours, he doesn't talk much to his sitters. Freud, he says, was ""amusing, gossipy and bitchy about other artists.""

Hockney laughs but doesn't elaborate. Both artists attended royal lunches as members of the Order of Merit, and he confides that Freud was always better at conversing with the Queen, as they had a common interest in horse racing.

Hanging by the studio staircase is Hockney's design for a six-meter (20 feet) high stained-glass window honoring the Queen, which is set to be unveiled in Westminster Abbey in October (we are quickly told that we can't film it). Suffice to say, it shows nature at her most glorious.

The image was drawn from memory on an iPad and features a favorite subject, hawthorn blossom. Hockney was obviously inspired by his prolonged stay in Yorkshire (2005-2013) where, year after year, he painted the seasons en plein air. A composite photo shows how it will appear once it's installed by the Abbey's transept. It looks splendid, enlivening an august religious space.

Every day, Hockney paints for six or seven hours. ""I'm perfectly happy doing this,"" he says. ""I feel 30 when I'm in the studio, so I come in every day and work, because then I feel 30.""

Hockney never seems to stop thinking about work. He takes iPad images of his current paintings to bed, so he can look at them and know ""what to do straight away"" the next morning. Painting is Hockney's be-all and end-all.

Our interview is regularly punctuated by his smoker's laugh, a guttural infectious chuckle. But he also seems older and more fragile, perhaps a tacit awareness of mortality. More than ever, he is reluctant to leave his studio -- his refuge, his cave.

He doesn't want to walk far or go to restaurants where he can't hear anything (he has got progressively deafer in recent years, and wears hearing aids in both ears). He is less and less keen on flying, disliking both long flights and travelling alone.

""Travelling, I feel 80,"" he says poignantly.

A bigger book

For almost the first time in his life, Hockney has begun looking back at his work in its entirety to reflect on his exhilarating artistic journey. Implicit in our conversation is the sense of an artist reflecting on his place in art history. And his undeniable conclusion is: ""Yes, I've made a few memorable pictures. I know that now.""

A crucial moment in this self-reflection has been the release of ""A Bigger Book,"" a 77-pound ""sumo"" book published in 2016. It is, he acknowledges, his autobiography.

""Well, I realized,"" says Hockney, flipping through the pages, ""that this would last 100 years. Most people will see my work in this book. So why not make it good?""

His own copy -- which comes on a bespoke stand designed by Marc Newson -- is within easy reach, a few feet from his armchair. ""I keep looking through it,' he admits.

""I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years,"" he muses. ""Every day I've done what I want to do.""

""That's a privilege', I say. ""I know I'm privileged,"" comes the reply, ""I've always known that I was privileged.""

Hanging on the wall, just by the studio entrance, is a framed handwritten note. It was pressed into Hockney's hand by a stranger while he was visiting a museum. It reads: ""Thank you for brightening our world.""

""That was OK, wasn't it?"" he asks rather sweetly at the end of the interview. ""Yes,"" I exclaim, ""more than OK. Thank you!"" And it's true. Hockney has been in fine fettle -- funny and characteristically open, two of the many reasons why he has been so admired and loved for so long.

On camera, the years seemed to fall away. He sparkles and looks momentarily boyish. Before we wind our way back down the Hollywood Hills, he signs my Hockney book for me -- ""with love, David and a kiss"" -- and sees us out with a gentle handshake.

The Shenzhen effect: Why China's original 'model' city matters more than ever,"Written by Jonathan Chatwin, CNN

Jonathan Chatwin is a writer, journalist and author of books including "" Long Peace Street: A Walk in Modern China .""

By 2035, China's government expects over 70% of the country's population -- around a billion people -- to be living in cities.

Both Shanghai and Beijing have announced population limits and are implementing policies to reduce the number of new arrivals. These restrictions look likely to be replicated in many of China's more populous cities.

But the rate of urbanization shows no sign of slowing. So, while existing smaller cities can absorb some of the millions who relocate, China is, with increasing haste, looking to develop entirely new urban areas in order to provide homes, jobs and infrastructure -- all while driving economic growth.

The most high-profile of these is Xiongan, a new city being built across three counties in Hebei province, 100 kilometers to Beijing's south west. Announced to great fanfare in April 2017, it's expected to house up to 2.5 million people . Large-scale construction began in 2019 and, over the next decade, an ambitious government plan will see many of Beijing's businesses, universities and hospitals relocated to this new city, alleviating pressure on the capital and encouraging hi-tech economic development in a traditionally industrial area.

Across the country, China's government is investing trillions of yuan to establish new areas and development zones, many of which act as satellites to existing cities. To the south of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Tianfu New Area has been developed over the last decade and is soon set to open Unicorn Island , a 166-acre technology hub designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. In Changsha, capital of Hunan province, the vast and similarly ambitious Xiangjiang New Area is intended to attract hi-tech industry and is home to the country's first test zone for autonomous public transport.

These projects all look back to one city for inspiration: the godfather of urban transformation and the country's ""model"" city, Shenzhen. Now home to over 13 million people, the southern metropolis is the Chinese government's proudest symbol of the last 40 years of economic reform.

Building on Shenzhen

On September 4, 1984, the sound of firecrackers echoed through the streets of Shenzhen as the city celebrated the completion of the International Trade Center, its -- and, at the time, China's -- tallest building.

Deng Xiaoping, the country's then paramount leader, had visited the site earlier that year and had given the project his seal of approval. He was particularly impressed by the speed of construction, which -- though it began slowly, partly due to a lack of proper equipment -- eventually reached a rate of one new floor every three days. The pace with which the upper floors of the tower were built became known as ""Shenzhen speed,"" part of the pervasive mythology that clouds the origins of this so-called ""Instant City.""

For visitors to Shenzhen in the 1980s, the 50-story skyscraper dominated the city's skyline. Over time, however, neighboring buildings would reach, and then exceed, the International Trade Center. As Juan Du, an architect and author of new book ""The Shenzhen Experiment"" observed in an email interview: ""This cluster of tall buildings became the image of China's post-reform modernization and urbanization.""

Special Economic Zones

As China began reforming its economic system and opening up to the world, a process initiated by Deng in the late 1970s, Shenzhen was established as one of China's first four ""Special Economic Zones,"" or SEZs. All four were chosen for their favorable geographical position and access to global markets, with Shenzhen located just across the river from the international hub of Hong Kong.

An oft-repeated myth is that Shenzhen grew from a fishing village. But in 1980 it was already a bustling market town. The surrounding areas that would become the SEZ covered almost 330 square kilometers and included a number of other pre-existing villages and towns. The official population of the SEZ at the time was 94,100, according to Du's research.

Although Shenzhen is now considered a success story, its establishment and early development was not without controversy. The city was, as Deng acknowledged, an experiment, and thus diverged from rules that applied to the rest of China. Shenzhen was allowed to try out comparatively radical ideas, like loosening price controls on goods and inviting foreign direct investment.

Shenzhen was such an exception that, for much of its existence, it was physically separated from the rest of the country by a barbed wire fence. This fortified perimeter was interspersed with seven manned checkpoints and was known as the ""Second Line"" (the first being the border with the semi-autonomous Hong Kong to the south).

Until 2006, visitors from other parts of China needed their passports and a special permit to enter the SEZ.

When Deng visited in 1984, he asserted that SEZs were ""windows of technology, management, knowledge and foreign policy,"" designed to showcase China's potential to the rest of the world -- and the rest of the country. The city was intended to become a ""national model for China's modernization and urbanization,"" Du said.

Architecture and design became crucial ways of representing this model vision of modern China. The country's urban spaces have long emphasized the importance of symmetry, with streets traditionally laid out in straight lines running east to west and north to south. Following these principles, Shenzhen initially spread out along its first east-west avenue, whilst the city's main Central Business District was laid out along a prominent north to south axis, flanked by skyscrapers and landmark architectural projects.

Shenzhen was not, however, a blank slate onto which a symmetrically ordered city could be drawn. Existing villages within the boundaries of the Special Economic Zone grew exponentially, as they were often the first destinations for the thousands of newcomers looking for an affordable place to live.

Those who owned village properties would quickly extend their houses upwards and outwards to offer low-rent accommodation for new arrivals. ""Without the villages, the city would never have grown with the famous 'Shenzhen speed,'"" Jonathan Bach wrote in ""Learning from Shenzhen,"" a collection of essays on the city. ""The city could never have sustained the cost of housing and supporting so much labor.""

However, over time, the villages have been surrounded and overshadowed by new, more lucrative developments -- or razed by developers seeking new opportunities for growth.

As Du observed in ""The Shenzhen Experiment,"" many people in China share a stereotyped view of the surviving villages as being ""dirty, disorderly and inferior,"" though they have been integral in driving Shenzhen's success, and their vibrancy and dynamism are a key aspect of the city's culture. There are still hundreds of these ""urban villages,"" and one of the unresolved challenges in Shenzhen's development is how to sensitively manage and integrate them -- and the millions of people who live in them -- into an ever-growing metropolis that leaders like to promote as an orderly, model city.

A new city center

Shenzhen has proven such a success that it's now faced with a problem unimaginable to its original planners: A lack of space.

One source of new land has been found by building onto what was once the sea.

Through extensive land reclamation, the waterfront at the city's southern edge was extended into the bay almost 20 years ago. A new city center business district, dubbed Shenzhen Bay Headquarters City, is now being built on that land.

""We intend to make Shenzhen Bay a complementary city center to the string of existing central business districts of Shenzhen,"" said Claude Godefroy of Henning Larsen Architects, one of three firms to win a competition to design the new district, in an email interview.

With the first phase of building expected to be completed by 2022, the project features a north-south axis and showpiece skyscraper (the project's main tower will reach a height of over 1,640 feet, the architects said, placing it firmly in the world's 20 tallest buildings).

But beyond the superlatives, its design aims to correct the mistakes of the past. Although Shenzhen has been treated as a model city, the power of hindsight has exposed some of the original plan's shortcomings.

In a city where ""oversize impassable highways crisscross the city and isolate neighborhoods from each other,"" as Godefroy put it, Shenzhen Bay will be pedestrian friendly. A waterfront promenade will be lined with bars and restaurants, correcting ""an historic failure in Shenzhen's urban planning: its disconnection with the sea,"" he added. ""Citizens complain that they sometimes forget they are living in a coastal city.""

One of the project's goals is to attract skilled Chinese and international workers to the city. ""All megacities compete to attract the talents of tomorrow,"" Godefroy said, ""and Shenzhen lags behind in livability compared to Hong Kong.""

The idea of Shenzhen competing with neighboring Hong Kong, long a prosperous global trading hub, is hardly new. But a government plan published over the summer of 2019 directly declared its ambition for Shenzhen to itself become ""a capital of innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity with international influence.""

The plan emphasizes making the city more internationally open, developing its reputation as a technology hub -- it is already home to Chinese tech giants Huawei, Tencent and ZTE, among others -- and improving its environmental credentials. It is to become a ""pioneering demonstration zone of socialism with Chinese characteristics"" according to the State Council , China's cabinet.

""The State Council document was not part of the brief for Shenzhen Bay, but every architect involved with Shenzhen knows that is the agenda,"" said Godefroy. Although he doesn't believe Shenzhen can become a true competitor to Hong Kong, as ""their economies have such a different focus,"" he said that the government's ambition for the new development was very clear -- it wants to ""make this district the spearhead of a plan to position Shenzhen a model city for China and the world.""

A model for China

China's politicians have persistently tried to replicate the ""Shenzhen effect"" as they develop other urban areas around the country.

These new areas often feature architectural motifs reminiscent of Shenzhen, sprawling along broad, perpendicular avenues flanked by convention centers, malls and flagship skyscrapers. And, like Shenzhen, they are generally built with economic revitalization in mind, with local governments often offering favorable terms to developers and companies relocating there.

Take Shanghai's Pudong district, across the river from the city's famous Bund, which drew inspiration from Shenzhen. In early 1990, Deng, who often wintered in Shanghai, began to encourage China's next generation of leaders to allow Pudong -- relatively rural in comparison to the city it faced across the water -- to redevelop, saying that he had made a mistake by not including Shanghai in the original group of Special Economic Zones in 1979. According to Ezra Vogel's 2011 biography of Deng, the paramount leader argued the city could, at least, benefit from developing later than Shenzhen by learning the lessons of its predecessor.

Pudong has since become home to a famed skyline punctuated by some of China's tallest buildings, and the center of the country's financial sector. The district's planning and development was certainly more centralized and coordinated than that of Shenzhen, but despite innovative plans proposed by international architecture firms, Pudong ended up re-articulating the same ideas of urban development: build quickly and ambitiously, maximize land value and prioritize the commercial over the human.

Beyond Pudong, China has struggled to successfully export Shenzhen's remarkable example. Even the other three SEZs established at the same time as Shenzhen -- Shantou, Xiamen and Zhuhai -- failed to develop in anything like the same explosive manner. A myriad of different factors has influenced this -- geography, size and scale, specific local policies and the nature of the cities' populations. As Du noted in her book, ""Shenzhen ... is not a singular transferable model but a plurality, informed by local conditions and local communities.""

Xiongan, Xi's model city

Beijing's new satellite city, Xiongan, is China's latest attempt to replicate the success of Shenzhen. President Xi Jinping has appointed Shenzhen's former mayor and party chief, Xu Qin, as governor of Hebei province, where the city is being built. State media has referred to Xiongan as the "" Shenzhen of the North "" while, according to its master plan, the project is intended to become ""a model city in the history of human development.""

There are differences between Xiongan's development and that of Shenzhen, however. Most obviously, whereas all of the original Special Economic Zones were coastal areas designed to attract foreign capital, Xiongan is 150 kilometers from the nearest coastline.

It will mainly serve a center for domestic, rather than international, industries -- in particular, many of the country's massive state-owned enterprises currently based in Beijing.

The government also emphasizes that Xiongan will be a green ""smart city,"" built on a more human scale and with lower population density than China's sprawling megacities. The city will be comparatively low-rise, and free from the ever-taller skyscrapers that define most new urban developments. Early work has focused on improving environmental conditions in what is one of the most polluted areas of China, with the sizeable Baiyangdian Lake -- around which the city will be oriented -- subject to an intensive clean-up operation.

As with Shenzhen, Xiongan must also navigate the complexities of managing the area's existing population. When Xiongan was first announced, a rush of real estate trading led the government to freeze property sales.

The government has subsequently restricted speculation further by announcing that housing in Xiongan will be subject to strict state controls -- a substantial change to the policy of Shenzhen, where property development was a key driver of economic growth.

Many of the existing residents have already been relocated and compensated. But with a population of around 1 million people in the area -- and over 500 villages to be redeveloped -- enabling satisfactory outcomes for low-income and often older rural residents remains problematic.

One key similarity between the two cities, however, is in the way Xiongan will be integrated into a greater conglomeration of urban centers. Just as Shenzhen now blends almost imperceptibly into the Pearl River Delta's other cities, such as Guangzhou and Dongguan, so Xiongan will be connected via high-speed rail with Beijing and Tianjin, to its east, to form a 130-million-person megalopolis nicknamed 'Jing-Jin-Ji' (a portmanteau of the names of Beijing, Tianjin and ""Ji,"" an ancient name for Hebei province).

There is clearly no lack of ambition for Xiongan. It is a project that reflects the ambitions and concerns of China's current leadership, with Xi seemingly hoping to emulate Deng's legacy in Shenzhen by very publicly attaching his name to the project. ""General Secretary Xi Jinping has planned for, made decisions on and promoted (Xiongan) in person, devoting painstaking efforts,"" read a 2018 planning document.

The extent to which Xiongan will copy -- or diverge from -- the template established by the model city of Shenzhen remains to be seen. But what is indisputable is that Shenzhen's example, both positive and negative, remains hugely influential in China's urban planning, even four decades after the city was established.",
Rare images by one of history's earliest photographers up for sale,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Almost 200 images by one of history's first photographers, William Henry Fox Talbot, are going under the hammer in New York next month, offering collectors a rare glimpse at early Victorian Britain.

According to Sotheby's auction house, which is handling the sale, the collection is ""arguably the most important lot of 19th century photographs to ever come to market.""

The images depict indoor and outdoor scenes, spanning architecture, botany and daily life in the 1840s. Talbot, an English scientist and inventor, also produced various portraits of family members and friends as he experimented with his pioneering camera technology.

Offered at auction as a single lot, the collection comprises over 70 loose photographs and three albums of printed images. It also includes rare versions of Talbot's publication ""Sun Pictures in Scotland"" which documents his travels through Scotland, as well as several parts of his celebrated work ""The Pencil of Nature.""

Some of the photographer's best-known images are among the 191 up for sale, including a shot showing the now-famous London monument, Nelson's Column, under construction in 1844. According to the head of Sotheby's photography department, Emily Bierman, the value of the collection lies not simply in its age and condition, but in its variety and completeness.

""Over the years, these photographs have become harder and harder to find, because they are snapped up and are in private or institutional collections,"" Bierman said in a phone interview. ""To have a full collection, an archive ... is something you couldn't even dream up.

""The photos include a great mixture of personal studies, as well as images from his travels and of important monuments ... though some of the greatest surprises are definitely the portraits,"" she added, referencing rare images of Talbot's mother and the celebrated writer Thomas Moore.

In the 1840s, Talbot gave the items to his half-sister Henrietta Horatia Maria Gaisford, who appears in a number of the photos. They have been passed down through the family ever since, with next month's auction marking the first time they have been available on the collectors' market. Gaisford's personal sketchbook, which contains drawings and watercolors, is also included in the sale.

Sotheby's has estimated that the collection will go for between $300,000 and $500,000. Should it do so, the sale would surpass the previous record for a collection of Talbot's photos, set at Sotheby's in 2018, when a complete copy of ""The Pencil of Nature"" was purchased for $275,000

Early pioneer

Talbot developed his groundbreaking ""salted paper"" photography technique during a vacation in the early 1830s, when he grew frustrated with the limitations of sketching. Using a solution containing salt and, later, silver nitrate, he created a light-sensitive surface from ordinary writing paper, which darkened when exposed to sunlight.

He would later develop the influential calotype (or talbotype) technique, which was more complex than the salted paper process but drastically reduced exposure times . Though not as popular as the daguerreotype, which became widely used around the world in the 1840s, Talbot's technique proved hugely influential in the development of camera technology, as it produced photographic negatives that allowed images to be more easily replicated.

But while Talbot was a keen alchemist and an important figure in the science of photography, Bierman also commended his artistic sensibilities.

""The compositions are incredibly sophisticated,"" she said, citing a landscape photo taken in Scotland that used the water's reflection to produce a ""confluence of triangles that are perfectly centered.""

""Thinking about the constraints he would have faced in practicing photography so early, to have the foresight as to how exactly you're going to translate what you see before you into a physical print is, I think, true artistry.""

Talbot's collection is going under the hammer as part of the "" 50 Masterworks to Celebrate 50 Years of Sotheby's Photographs "" auction, which brings together some of the medium's most important names. The sale features a number of other valuable early images, including a male nude by pioneering French photographer Eugène Atget, expected to sell for up to $150,000, and an 1867 image of a riverside garrison in Oregon that carries a top estimate of $350,000.

How do art auctions really work?

More contemporary offerings include a collection of Sebastião Salgado's depictions of a Brazilian gold mine, Martin Parr's series ""The last Resort"" and 11 images by the celebrated fashion photographer Richard Avedon.

According to Bierman, photography sales have weathered the pandemic more successfully than many other parts of the auction market, which has been severely disrupted by limits on viewing events and in-person sales. She attributed some of this to first-time buyers, who may see photography as a more accessible and affordable way into art collecting.

""In 2020, about a third of our bidders and buyers for photograph sales were either new to the market completely or new to Sotheby's,"" she said. ""That's astonishing and definitely points to a healthy market.""",
A photographic history of men in love,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

When Hugh Nini and Neal Treadwell came across an old photograph at an antique store in Dallas, Texas, they saw something of themselves reflected in the image.

Taken around 1920, it showed two men in front of a house, posing in a loving embrace at a time when being gay was not only frowned upon but effectively illegal.

""It represented us, so we bought the photo, took it home and had it on our desks for six or nine months,"" Treadwell recalled in a phone interview from the couple's home in New York City. ""It was a random find, and we never thought we'd find another one.""

Yet, in the two decades since, the pair discovered far more -- in fact, by scouring auctions, junk stores and flea markets, they've amassed an archive of almost 3,000 images of men in love.

Captured between the mid-19th century and just after World War II, and taken across five continents, the collection comprises portraits and candid shots of couples lying in bed, picnicking on grass and posing beside their cars. Nini and Treadwell may not know the circumstances in which the pictures were taken, but they believe the subjects' body language and mutual gazes are, unmistakably, those of romantic lovers.

Now, they have published more than 300 of the pictures in the book ""Loving: A Photographic History of Men in Love, 1850s-1950s."" Together, they offer intimate glimpses into romantic lives that would likely have remained hidden.

""This book means, for the first time, that these people, these couples, get to speak for themselves,"" Nini said. ""They couldn't do it when they were alive, but they can do it now, and I think that's really powerful.""

Given that many of the images come from a time when taking, developing or keeping such photos could pose a significant risk to one's personal safety -- or even freedom -- the pictures also represent individual acts of bravery, he added.

""These couples did something very risky because they really cared about each other. They memorialized their feelings with these photographs, and then had to hide them forever,"" he said.

Forbidden love

The photos show young couples that could have only dreamed of the freedoms afforded to Nini and Treadwell, who wed unofficially in 1992 (and then legally 14 years later, after Massachusetts became the first US state to permit same-sex marriage).

Nonetheless, their collection shows historical examples of men exchanging rings and partaking in informal wedding ceremonies. In one image, believed to be from the turn of the 20th century, a young pair are seen holding a sign reading, ""Not married but willing to be.""

As well as showing the evolution of attitudes, hairstyles and fashion through the decades, the images also chart the development of photography as a medium. The collection's oldest pictures were made using early forms of camera, and include ambrotypes, which were produced on glass, and daguerreotypes, which appeared on metal plates.

As well as posed portraits, the collection contains pictures of couples lying in bed and having picnics. Credit: Courtesy Nini-Treadwell Collection/5 Continents Editions

The archive travels through to the emergence of paper photography and then photo booths, which, like the various shots taken in the reflections of mirrors, eliminated the need to confide in a photographer.

And while Nini and Treadwell know next to nothing about their subjects, they know even less about where the physical photos have been in the decades since.

""Some of the pictures have creases in them, so perhaps they were folded and put in a wallet, while some are pristine, where they had been tucked in a book or hidden away in a drawer,"" Treadwell said.

""It's astonishing to us to wonder what that journey was -- not only for the couple but for the photograph being passed along. Was it shared by friends? Was it celebrated by a family? How did it make its way into our hands?""

It is, therefore, left to the viewer to imagine the stories behind each photo. And the breadth of positive responses to the collection is testament to the universality of love, the pair said.

""It's very heart-warming and gratifying to know that it's meaningful, and that this spans from someone who's 18 or 20 right up to grandparents who are looking at (the pictures) because their grandchildren are gay. Or it's an elderly gay person, or straight people -- the whole gamut,"" Treadwell said.

""The message of our book is not about sexuality at all,"" Nini added. ""Our position is that love doesn't have a sexuality -- it's universal.""",
Graphic novel on the Tiananmen Massacre shows medium's power to capture history,"James Griffiths , CNN Hong Kong Written by

As a young man in Beijing in the 1980s, Lun Zhang felt like he was taking part in a new Chinese enlightenment.

becoming newly available. The country was undergoing paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's "" Reform and Opening Up ,"" and previously sealed-off areas of knowledge, arts, and culture werebecoming newly available.

People who had only years before been living in the stifling, hyper-Maoist orthodoxy of the Cultural Revolution, in which anything foreign or historical was deemed counter-revolutionary, could now listen to Wham!, hold intellectual salons in which people read Jean-Paul Sartre or Sigmund Freud, or even publish their own works, taking aim at previously sacred political targets.

""In those days, our thirst to read, learn and explore the outside world was insatiable,"" Zhang writes in his new graphic novel, ""Tiananmen 1989: Our Shattered Hopes.""

But with this intellectual awakening came a growing frustration with the pace of reform in China, particularly how economic liberalization was taking precedence over any suggestion that the Communist Party give up its tight control on the country's politics.

An apocryphal quote attributed to Deng captured the mood at this time, that ""to get rich is glorious,"" but for many people, it was increasingly apparent that only a handful were becoming wealthy, while others were suffering due to growing corruption and the destruction of the social safety net.

Small demonstrations against graft and for greater political reform ballooned into what would become the 1989 Tiananmen movement , in which hundreds of thousands of people protested across the country, with the largest demonstration in Beijing led by workers and student groups.

The pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square for months, even holding meetings with top officials. At the time, many felt hopeful that these actions would bring about wider societal change in the one-party state.

Crackdown

Zhang was on the square that spring, when the protesters put forward seven demands, including for democratic elections and an end to state censorship. He was there as the crowds paid tribute to the late reformist leader Hu Yaobang, and he was there as the occupiers sang and danced on what had become the people's square.

He was not there when soldiers opened fire on protesters and fought with them in the streets of the Chinese capital. He was not there when the tanks rolled in. Zhang was in the suburbs of the city with another activist, recuperating in preparation for what some thought would be a last push before the government gave into the protesters' demands.

""When we heard the army had entered Beijing, we tried to reach the square, but our efforts were in vain,"" Zhang writes of when they learned of the bloodshed.

Far from reaching the center of the city, Zhang's attention turned to escape: the authorities were rounding up prominent protesters and leaders, and he was worried about arrest. He fled first to rural China, eventually becoming one of dozens of Tiananmen protesters smuggled into Hong Kong by activists in the then British colony.

Graphic novel

Zhang eventually moved to France, where he has lived ever since, and is teaching at the Cergy-Pontoise University near Paris. While he writes about the Chinese economy and geopolitics, he has largely left out his own personal history prior to this month's publication of his graphic novel.

""I worked with (French journalist) Adrien Gombeaud, who wrote the script for the format,"" Zhang told CNN. ""We read some graphic novels about historical events, and together came up with the plan, for example, to imagine a theater scene to link all the parts of the story.""

While the Tiananmen Square Massacre has been widely covered in the media and in documentaries, with many focusing on the iconic image of the Tank Man or utilizing archive footage from the square itself, much of the events leading up to the infamous night have been lost to history, available only through witnesses' accounts. Zhang said that the comics format provided a key means of capturing the emotion of the demonstrations, in a way that does not necessarily come across in text.

""It is difficult to find a satisfactory way in which this kind of big event is reported, in my opinion,"" he said. ""In some reporting on Tiananmen, the authors didn't reflect enough on the will of students to cooperate with the authorities in peacefully reforming China.

""When you take into account the emotion involved, we can understand why the peaceful way of demonstration was chosen, why there was the huge hunger strike.""

After the initial script was written, the authors worked with French artist Ameziane to develop the comic's visuals, by sourcing images of the various characters, and referencing archival photos of era-appropriate objects, such as clothes, cars and teacups from 1980s China. ""We spent a lot of time in discussions on how to arrange the scenes, how to convey the essential message, what limits we might have on a given page. It played to the style and skill of our painter,"" Zhang said.

The shift in artistic style is most notable in the scenes depicting the massacre itself. Prior pages feature white backgrounds and muted colors, but as the crackdown begins, the pages turn to black, with a heavy use of oranges and reds. Ameziane's illustrations become looser and full of movement, emphasizing the chaos and panic experienced by the characters.

The book is structured in several acts, with Zhang as its narrator. He said the play format was an obvious storytelling device, given ""the protest movement itself felt like a drama, with its different phases akin to great acts.""

Comics journalism

Zhang, Gombeaud and Ameziane's book joins what has quietly become a major strand of modern comics: graphic journalism or historical comics dealing with topics that were once considered out of the art form's remit.

American cartoonist Art Spiegelman's ""Maus,"" a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of his parents' experiences as Holocaust survivors -- with the Jews depicted as mice and the Nazis as cats -- has long been considered a masterwork in the graphic novel genre.

While adult themes and history were features in comics long before ""Maus"" debuted in 1980, including in Spiegelman's own work, its use of accessible, black and white art combined with a sweeping historical narrative broke into the mainstream, and set a new standard for ""grown up"" comics with political subject matter and potentially upsetting content.

Works like Maltese-American Joe Sacco's ground-breaking comics journalism in ""Palestine"" or ""Safe Area Gorazde,"" and French-Iranian Marjane Satrapi's ""Persepolis"" have further driven this trend, with the latter turned into an Oscar-nominated movie in 2007.

The popularity of comics and graphic novels has only grown in recent years -- with the help of blockbuster film adaptations. This has happened in conjunction with the rise of comics journalism, in everything from newspapers to dedicated publications such as The Nib , which has long recognized the medium's ability to tackle serious issues, interweaving reporting with satirical cartoons.

Sacco has talked about how the use of comics, the presentation of the artist and writer as a figure in the story, helps remove ""the illusion that a journalist is a fly on the wall, all seeing and all knowing.""

in a ""To me, drawing myself signals to the reader that I'm a filter between the information, the people and them. They know that I'm a presence, and that they're seeing things through my eyes,"" he saidin a recent interview

This is very much apparent in Zhang's book, as he uses his role as narrator to critique both the protest movement and himself.

Asked once about whether drawing helped him deal with being the child of Holocaust survivors, Spiegelman answered : ""I've had therapy, and I've made comics. The comics are cheaper.""

Part of ""Maus"" deals with Spiegelman's guilt over his difficult relationship with his father and in comparing his problems with depression and work to the experiences of his parents. Zhang too writes in ""Tiananmen"" of his own survivor's guilt and of questioning his decisions made as a younger man in the midst of history.

In an interview, Zhang said he did not write about Tiananmen for so long, because his role, his involvement, seemed inconsequential compared to what some went through.

""The way I saw it, there were many people dead or wounded in the aftermath, and many people lost their jobs; their families were never the same after,"" he said. ""The real heroes were the ordinary students and people in (Beijing) and other cities. By comparison, what I did personally didn't seem worth telling. The most important thing I could do was live my life in a way that wouldn't dishonor the dead.""

He was eventually convinced by an editor to write the book last year, around the 30th anniversary of the massacre. ""She convinced me that I had a duty to the memory of that time,"" Zhang said. ""I accepted it. 'No justice, no peace,' but I think also, 'No memory, no justice.'""",
Tetris: The Soviet 'mind game' that took over the world,"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

Read more unknown and curious design origin stories here

Like many of history's greatest ideas, Tetris came about quite unintentionally.

Alexey Pajitnov was a software engineer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow, tasked with testing a new type of computer, the Electronika 60. To do so, he wrote a simple game based on a puzzle from his childhood. It would help assess how powerful the computer was -- and provide a bit of fun.

Little did he know that the resulting game would go on to become one of the greatest, most addictive and most successful of all time.

It was June 6, 1984, and Tetris had just started its journey from behind the Iron Curtain.

The original version of Tetris.

Tetris is a puzzle game in which geometric shapes called ""tetrominoes"" fall down onto a playing field, and the player has to arrange them to form gapless lines. Pajitnov took inspiration from pentomino, a classic puzzle game consisting of all the different shapes that can be made by combining five squares -- 12 in total -- with the goal of arranging them in a wooden box like a jigsaw puzzle.

To simplify things, he knocked that down to four squares, thus reducing the number of shapes from 12 to seven. He called the game Tetris, combining the Greek numeral ""tetra"" (meaning four) and tennis, his favorite sport.

Pajitnov himself was immediately hooked. ""I couldn't stop myself from playing this prototype version, because it was very addictive to put the shapes together,"" he said on the phone from Seattle, where he now lives.

But creating a video game in Soviet Russia at the height of the Cold War was far from easy. It was only through the sheer brilliance of its design that Tetris was transformed from a quirky test program into a worldwide phenomenon.

Word of mouth

Although Tetris became immediately popular among programmers with access to an Electronika 60, the machine had no graphical capabilities -- and less memory than today's calculators. Pressed with requests to create a version of the game for the IBM PC, a more widespread computer with better graphics, Pajitnov assigned the job to Vadim Gerasimov, a 16-year-old student on a summer job at his office (today an engineer at Google). The game spread quickly. ""It was like a wood fire. Everyone in the Soviet Union who had a PC had Tetris on it,"" said Pajitnov.

Pajitnov wasn't making any money off the game, nor did he intend to. Ideas were owned by the state and the very concept of selling software as a product was unfamiliar to him. People were just sharing Tetris through word of mouth and by copying it onto floppy disks.

Then, Pajitnov heard rumors that the game might have crossed borders and was being played in other Eastern bloc countries. In 1986, he got a message via telex -- a forerunner of the fax machine -- from Robert Stein, a salesman for a Hungary-based software company called Andromeda. Stein, who had seen Tetris in Hungary, wanted to secure the rights to sell it as a computer game in the West. He offered significant money in advance.

""My English was really bad at that time, so I put together some kind of positive answer, saying we were very glad to receive the proposal and that some agreement could be made,"" said Pajitnov. He knew that doing business directly with a Western firm could have landed him in jail, even before making any money, so he started investigating how he could sell the rights to Tetris through the state.

Stein, however, interpreted his response as a green light and immediately started producing the game. But as he was preparing to launch, he received another telex from Elorg -- short for Electronorgtechnica, the Soviet organization that oversaw software and hardware exports. It said that the rights had not been officially granted and that his launch was illegal.

Eventually, Stein cleared the rights, and Tetris was released as a commercial PC title in the UK and the US in 1988. The game played up its Soviet origins through Kremlin-themed illustrations and Cyrillic characters. But the misunderstanding between Pajitnov and Stein showed how tricky it would be to export a video game from Soviet Russia to the West for the first time -- an issue that led to years of confusion and legal battles, and is even rumored to have landed on the desk of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

The Game Boy

Tetris was selling well on computers, but the big money in the games sector was being made elsewhere: consoles. Henk Rogers, a Dutch video game developer and businessman living in Japan, was the first to realize that Tetris was a perfect match for the Game Boy, a new handheld system released by Nintendo in Japan in early 1989. The console was about to launch in North America and Europe too, and Rogers set out to convince the company to bundle a copy of the game in the box, a common practice outside of Japan.

""I made a handshake deal with Minoru Arakawa, the founder of Nintendo of America, to have Nintendo include Tetris in every Game Boy,"" said Rogers in a phone interview. ""He said, 'Why should I include Tetris? I have Mario.' And I said, 'If you want little boys to buy your Game Boy, then include Mario. But if you want everyone to buy your Game Boy, then you should include Tetris.'""

Rogers set out to obtain the necessary permissions, and soon realized what a challenge that would be. He had already published a version of Tetris in Japan, for the popular Nintendo Famicom home system, only to discover that there were half a dozen companies all claiming to own the rights to the game. ""So I got on a plane and went to Moscow on a tourist visa to track down the source of the rights, Elorg -- and talk my way into it,"" he said.

Once in Moscow, Rogers made little progress until he hired an interpreter, who swiftly took him to Elorg.

""She knew immediately where everything was, so that was fishy. They're not supposed to talk to foreigners, and I wasn't supposed to talk to the Russians, let alone people inside the government. So I broke all kinds of rules by being there. They interrogated me for two hours. I thought they were trying to figure out whether they were gonna send me to Siberia or not,"" he said.

But among the officials in the room was Alexey Pajitnov, who immediately took a liking to Rogers. ""Alexey was the only guy in the room who actually knew anything about games,"" Rogers recalled. ""I explained how business worked, and we became friends. A week later, I left Moscow with a signed agreement for Tetris on the Game Boy.""

Henk Rogers and Alexey Pajitnov in Moscow's Red Square.

The Game Boy version of Tetris sold 35 million units and helped the console become one of the most successful of all time. It is still considered by many -- Pajitnov included -- to be the best version of Tetris, and it created an unprecedented synergy between hardware and software, epitomizing the gaming mantra ""easy to learn, hard to master.""

Delayed royalties

Despite the game's success, Pajitnov was still not making any money from it. ""There was a lot of legal trouble, and when the question of ownership and the original source of the game came up, I decided that I wanted everything to go smoothly and I granted the rights to the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for 10 years,"" he said.

The legal trouble culminated in a skirmish between Nintendo and Atari over the home console rights for Tetris. A judge ruled in Nintendo's favor in late 1989, dealing a lethal blow to Atari, which had already produced hundreds of thousands of now useless copies of its version of the game, under the tagline ""Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game."" Nintendo took a different approach, opting for the slogan ""From Russia with fun.""

Pajitnov left Moscow for Seattle in 1991, with the help of his friend Henk Rogers. And when his deal over the rights expired in 1995, he finally started receiving royalties for the game. ""And they've been fine so far,"" he said.

Pajitnov and Rogers in 2018.

In 1996, Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company, to handle licensing for Tetris and its spinoffs. In 2005, the Tetris Company bought Elorg -- which after the fall of the Soviet Union had transformed from a state-owned company into a private one -- gaining total control of all Tetris rights worldwide. The company has even standardized and trademarked the names and colors of every Tetris piece -- officially called Tetriminos , rather than the generic tetrominoes, although they have many unofficial nicknames

Tetris has been the subject of several scientific studies. One found that playing the game can be effective in fighting off cravings for food and even drugs, while another noted an increase in the thickness of some parts of the brain in people who had played regularly. Playing Tetris for prolonged periods of time can lead to players dreaming to about the falling pieces or interpreting real-world objects as tetrominoes and mentally re-arranging them -- a phenomenon known as ""the Tetris Effect.""

To date, Tetris has been released on over 65 platforms, a world record , with more than half a billion downloads on mobile devices, according to the Tetris Company. Pajitnov has personally worked on over 100 variants of the game.

The latest, released in early 2019 to coincide with the game's 35th anniversary, is an online multiplayer version called ""Tetris 99,"" which can be played by up to 99 players simultaneously. Since 2010, an eSports tournament based on the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Tetris has seen the world's best players gather in Portland, Oregon. Some of the matches, which can surpass 30 minutes in length, have garnered over 10 million views on YouTube.

""It hasn't lost any of its play value and nothing has come to replace Tetris,"" said Henk Rogers, explaining the game's enduring popularity.

""It's like 'Happy Birthday.' There have been lots of songs that come and go, but 'Happy Birthday' is it still always sung in the same way. Tetris has become the 'Happy Birthday' of computer games.""",
Remember when Jackie Kennedy wore her famous pillbox hat?,"Written by Matthew Ponsford, CNN

Remember when Jackie Kennedy attended her husband's presidential inauguration with a perfect egg-shaped pillbox hat perched atop her head?

That's because it was meant to be unmissable.

Everything that happened on January 20, 1961, was stage-managed to tell America that a new age was dawning. John F. Kennedy was set to become the first US leader born in the 20th century, the first Catholic commander-in-chief and the first president whose inaugural speech was beamed across crackly television screens in color

""Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,"" he implored a nation in need of reassurance and leadership at the height of the Cold War.

Not everything worked out as planned. Eight inches of snow fell on Washington overnight, winds lashed and, among all this, one accident would end up infiltrating American wardrobes.

Jackie's orb-like hat had been made to match a coat and fawn dress already created for her by her personal courtier Oleg Cassini. But it was also designed to look different: A cloth pillbox was exactly what everyone else would not be wearing.

In the freezing cold, many of the women sported stolid mink caps -- except Jackie, who stood out as the beacon of a new generation, characterized by clean lines and elegance. She appeared on the steps of the Capitol like ""the gorgeous petal in a dowdy bouquet of fur,"" according to Thurston Clarke, author of ""Ask Not,"" a book about the 1961 inauguration.

Jackie's distinctive headpiece was designed by Halston (real name Roy Halston Frowick). Later known as the creator of the free-flowing, slinky fashion of the 1970s disco era, Halston was then an up-and-coming New York milliner. He apparently spent hours sandwiched between two mirrors, shaping Jackie's hat into a perfect, simple dome.

Except, of course, it didn't end up like that.

Meet America's first superstar fashion designer

That morning, as she reached up to clasp the hat in high winds, Kennedy accidentally gave it a dimple -- a shallow indent, unnoticed but broadcast around the world. America swooned nonetheless. Kennedy's deification as the ultimate first lady of fashion had begun with a misshapen hat, its influence stretching to imitators from high society to the rural Midwest. Halston later laughed that ""everybody who copied it put a dent in it.""

Jackie's ensemble that day -- which she completed with a sable circlet and muff -- has become one of the most celebrated of presidential inauguration looks. But there's one thing we may have all been getting wrong: the color.

While most Americans will remember the first lady in duck-egg blue , complementing JFK's steel blue waistcoat and tie, color film footage from ""Halston,"" a CNN Films documentary about the legendary designer, shows her inauguration outfit appearing pinkish. And researchers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, where the outfit is stored, told CNN that the dress and hat were basically colorless -- a neutral, fawnish beige and not even slightly blue.

The origin of the mistake seems to be a color photograph from Life Magazine . But the cover of the same issue featured a very different photograph: Jackie in far less vivid tones, closer to the off-white captured by the handful of other press photographers present (early color film often struggled to match real hues).

So when, in 2017, Melania Trump wore a powder blue Ralph Lauren inauguration suit likened to Kennedy's, was it a tribute to an outfit that never existed?

Regardless of color, dimpled or not, the pillbox hat would become synonymous with Jackie's style as first lady. She wore one the day JFK was shot, twinned with a raspberry pink suit. The blood-covered suit is locked away in the National Archives, with instructions that it should hidden from public view until at least 2103 . The pink hat hasn't been seen since the fateful day she last wore it.

But the eulogizing of the first lady's ""looks"" risks relegating her to the role of a mere mannequin, when she in fact directed much of the new administration's aesthetic -- and not just when it came to fashion.

She may have spent fewer than three years in the White House, but during that time she brought in designers, including Stéphane Boudin, to modernize its interior. She also worked with legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy, the man behind the Lucky Strike cigarette packet and classic Studebaker cars, to choose the enduring powder blue of the US presidential plane, Air Force One.

JFK's inauguration marked the beginning of a new era of media-savvy presidents -- and he had his wife to thank for much of it.",
How ancient Egyptian cosmetics influenced our beauty rituals,"Written by Julia Wolkoff

This article was published in partnership with Artsy, the global platform for discovering and collecting art. The original article can be seen here . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

The mysteries of the ancient Egyptians are vast, but their beauty tricks are no secret. Makeup might seem like a modern phenomenon -- one that has grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry -- but cosmetics were equally important to daily life in the ancient world. From the earliest era of the Egyptian empire, men and women from all social classes liberally applied eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipstick and rouge.

The perceived seductiveness of Egyptian civilization has a lot to do with how we've glamorized its two most famous queens: Cleopatra and Nefertiti. In 1963, Elizabeth Taylor defined the chic Egyptian look when she portrayed Cleopatra in the eponymous epic. In 2017, Rihanna (herself a makeup magnate) perfected it when she paid tribute to Nefertiti on the cover of Vogue Arabia. In their homages, both beauty icons wore saturated blue eyeshadow and thick, dark eyeliner.

Yet ancient Egyptians didn't only apply makeup to enhance their appearances -- cosmetics also had practical uses, ritual functions, or symbolic meanings. Still, they took their beauty routines seriously: The hieroglyphic term for makeup artist derives from the root ""sesh,"" which translates to write or engrave, suggesting that a lot of skill was required to apply ""kohl"" or lipstick (as anyone who has tried to emulate beauty tutorials on YouTube can attest).

The most refined beauty rituals were carried out at the toilettes of wealthy Egyptian women. A typical regimen for such a woman living during the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2030-1650 B.C.) would have been indulgent, indeed. Before applying any makeup, she would first prepare her skin.

She might exfoliate with Dead Sea salts or luxuriate in a milk bath -- milk-and-honey face masks were popular treatments. She could apply incense pellets to her underarms as deodorant, and floral- or spice-infused oils to soften her skin. Egyptians also invented a natural method of waxing with a mixture of honey and sugar. ""Sugaring,"" as it's called today, has been revived by beauty companies as a less painful alternative to hot wax.

After all this, a servant would bring in the many ingredients and tools necessary to create and apply her makeup. These apparatuses, containers and applicators were themselves lavish art objects that communicated social status. Calcite jars held makeup or unguents and perfumes and containers for eye paint and oils were crafted from expensive materials like glass, gold or semi-precious stones. Siltstone palettes used to crush materials for kohl and eyeshadow were carved to resemble animals, goddesses or young women.

These symbols represented rebirth and regeneration, and the act of grinding pigments on an animal palette was thought to grant the wearer special capabilities by overcoming the creature's power. (Members of the lower classes used more modest tools when applying their own makeup.)

The servant would create eyeshadow by mixing powdered malachite with animal fat or vegetable oils. While the lady sat at her toilette, before a polished bronze ""mirror,"" the servant would use a long ivory stick -- perhaps carved with an image of the goddess Hathor -- to sweep on the rich green pigment. Just as women do today, eyeshadow would be followed with a thick line of black kohl around her eyes.

This part of the routine had practical purposes beyond beautifying the wearer. Kohl was used by both sexes and all social classes to protect the eyes from the intense glare of the desert sun. The Egyptian word for ""makeup palette"" derives from their word meaning ""to protect,"" a reference to its defensive abilities against the harsh sunlight or the ""evil eye."" Additionally, the toxic, lead-based mineral that it was made from had antibacterial properties when combined with moisture from the eyes.

The final touches to this lady's makeup would, of course, be red lipstick -- a classic look even today. To make the paint, ochre was typically blended with animal fat or vegetable oil, though Cleopatra was known to crush beetles for her perfect shade of red. These highly toxic concoctions, often mixed with dyes extracted from iodine and bromine mannite, could lead to serious illness, or sometimes death -- possibly where the phrase ""kiss of death"" derives from.

In death, too, personal appearance was crucial to Egyptian identity. Burial sites uncovered from the very beginning of the society's history, in pre-dynastic times, show that it was common for Egyptians to include everyday items like combs, scented ointments, jewelry and cosmetics in the graves of men, women and children (many graves have been found with makeup still inside them).

We might closely associate the Egyptians with their dramatic beauty looks largely because of their prolific use on mummies and death masks. Instead of depicting their subjects' real features, these cartonnage masks and wooden coffins portray idealized youths with smooth skin and kohl-rimmed eyes.

In fact, mummification itself followed many of the daily self-care rituals Egyptians followed while alive. Unguents for softening the skin took on religious significance when they were used to anoint the body, and even cosmetics were sometimes applied.

The singular Egyptian aesthetic -- from architecture to art to makeup -- has captured the modern imagination for its elegance, exoticism and style. Yet the ancient kingdom's influence on our beauty ideals is more direct through its inventions, down to the eyeliner and lipstick we still love to wear.",
"NCAA Men's Final Four 2021: Full Breakdown, Predictions and Stars to Watch","6 of 12

Darron Cummings/Associated Press

Jared Butler, Baylor

Tournament Stats: 13.0 PPG, 4.8 APG, 3.3 RPG, 2.0 SPG, 6-of-24 (25.0 percent) from three

If you didn't watch Baylor during the regular season and tuned in expecting to be blown away by its first-team All-American, you've probably been disappointed. Butler shot it well against Wisconsin, but was limited by foul trouble. And then against both Villanova and Arkansas, he struggled to find his shooting stroke and didn't make anywhere near the type of impact he usually did for the past few months.

He's still undeniably one of the Bears' biggest stars, though, and could quickly make everyone forget about this uneven start to the tournament. If he lights up Houston for 30 points and eight assists like he did in Baylor's first game against Kansas, he'll immediately become a top candidate for Most Outstanding Player.

Quentin Grimes, Houston

Tournament Stats: 18.0 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 2.5 APG, 1.8 SPG, 17-of-39 (43.6 percent) from three

Over the past three rounds, Houston might as well have changed its name from the Cougars to the Bricklayers. They shot 65-of-181 (35.9 percent) from the field and 36-of-56 (64.3 percent) from the free-throw line.

But at least Grimes has remained hot from three-point range. Over his last 13 games, the combo guard has gone 59-of-124 from downtown, averaging 4.5 made triples per contest. He has also been a key defender with at least two steals in each of Houston's last three games. Considering how close the games against Rutgers and Oregon State were, the Cougars have needed every ounce of his production on both ends of the floor.

DeJon Jarreau, Houston

Tournament Stats*: 12.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.0 APG, 4-of-13 (30.8 percent) from three

*excludes opener vs. Cleveland State in which he played just one minute because of a hip injury

For a guy who wasn't even expected to play against Rutgers because of that hip injury, Jarreau has been sensational. He had 17 points against the Scarlet Knights, including the tide-shifting transition three-pointer late in the second half. And then this past weekend, he had at least nine points, eight rebounds and eight assists in each game. Hardly a surprise from a guy who had a triple-double against Tulane in Houston's first game of the AAC tournament. Houston is a perfect 14-0 this season when he has at least six assists or six rebounds.

Much like Quentin Grimes, Jarreau is also an indispensable asset on the defensive end of the floor, averaging nearly 2.0 combined blocks and steals per game. He also does a great job of slowing/shutting down fast-break opportunities, which in turn allows Houston to be more aggressive on the offensive glass.

Johnny Juzang, UCLA

Tournament Stats: 21.6 PPG, 3.6 RPG

Kentucky didn't even come close to making this year's NCAA tournament, but a former piece of Kentucky is shining ever so brightly for a different blue-blood program.

Juzang has been great throughout UCLA's five-game run, but he was particularly lethal in the first half of Tuesday night's win over Michigan. That Wolverines defense in the paint was every bit as impenetrable as advertised. Juzang single-handedly carried the Bruins with jumpers, though. Michigan threatened to blow the game wide open early on, but Juzang scored 14 of UCLA's first 16 points, had 18 by halftime and finished with 28.

The game was nowhere near as aesthetically pleasing as the 2019 Elite Eight classic between Virginia and Purdue, but Juzang's individual performance was on par with what Carsen Edwards did on that night two years ago.

Davion Mitchell, Baylor

Tournament Stats: 13.5 PPG, 4.8 APG, 2.0 SPG, 4-of-12 (33.3 percent) from three

At a certain point in the Sweet 16 game against Villanova, Mitchell realized that the Wildcats were helpless to contain his slashing. It was a similar story in Monday night's game against Arkansas. On offense, he's usually a perimeter shooter or a distributor, but he has been unleashed as a nearly unguardable layup machine. (If and when he starts hitting three-pointers again, too, yikes.)

But Mitchell's primary value comes on the defensive end of the court. He completely changed the trajectory of the Villanova game by terrorizing a roster devoid of an experienced point guard. And the game against Arkansas completely changed when he had to ride the pine with foul trouble and the Razorbacks suddenly had room to operate on offense. He isn't the guy with the highest NBA draft stock, but he's the most important player left in this tournament.

Jalen Suggs, Gonzaga

Tournament Stats: 12.3 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 4.8 APG, 1.5 SPG

Gonzaga certainly hasn't shied away from the spotlight, but Suggs struggled in the first three rounds. He was 1-of-11 from three-point range with 11 assists and 14 turnovers.

If you were worried that he hit the proverbial freshman wall, though, he erased those concerns with a monstrous performance against USC, crushing the Trojans with 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. (All three marks were his best of the tournament to date.) We'll see which version of Suggs shows up for the final weekend, but Gonzaga would cruise to a national championship if he has two more games like that one up his sleeve.

Drew Timme, Gonzaga

Tournament Stats: 21.3 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 4.3 APG

The most unstoppable part of the runaway freight train known as Gonzaga is Timme. He has now gone for at least 22 points, five rebounds and four assists in three straight games.

It's the assists that have made him impossible to guard. It's one thing to have great footwork, the ability to draw contact and the ability to finish through said contact, all of which Timme has. But his willingness to find the open teammate means you simply cannot afford to double him in the post. From there, he wins the one-on-one battle more often than not.

One other great thing about Timme is the way he walls off the post while jockeying for position. He's lethal with the ball in his hands, but he also thrives at creating space even when he's not the one doing the passing or shooting. Every single Gonzaga player converts twos at a high rate because Timme makes his teammates' shots easier.",
"Video: LeBron James, Don Cheadle Star in New 'Space Jam: A New Legacy' Trailer","AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez

The much-anticipated full-length trailer for Space Jam: A New Legacy has dropped online.

LeBron James takes center stage in the trailer along with Don Cheadle in the sequel to the 1996 hit starring Michael Jordan:

Based on the details, the story appears to be set up with James' son, Dom, getting trapped in a virtual world.

Cheadle shows up as Al-G Rhythm to demand that James play a game of basketball to get his son back to the real world.

While in the animated world, James and Looney Tunes members Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Co. come across other classic animated characters, including The Iron Giant.

The trailer also includes a reference to the iconic image of James, while playing for the Miami Heat, going up for a dunk with Dwyane Wade having his arms outstretched. In the movie, though, the famous Wade pose is done by Lola Bunny.

Former United States President Barack Obama praised Major League Baseball for its decision to move the All-Star Game from Atlanta in light of recent voter-restriction laws put in place by the state of Georgia.

After MLB announced the move, Obama tweeted there is ""no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron.""

Aaron is an iconic figure in Braves history, dating back to his first 12 seasons from 1954 to '65 when the franchise was in Milwaukee and its first nine seasons in Atlanta from 1966 to '74 after relocating.

After Aaron's death on Jan. 22 at the age of 86, Ernie Suggs of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the Baseball Hall of Famer's work in the civil rights movement throughout his life:

""After his promotion to the Milwaukee Braves in 1954, just a year before the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, Aaron began to take notice of the civil rights movement and Democratic causes. In 1960, while his boyhood idol Robinson supported Richard Nixon, Aaron traveled throughout Wisconsin campaigning for John F. Kennedy.""

[...]

""Long-time Atlanta friend Xernona Clayton said while Aaron may not have been as visible as others, 'He was someone we knew we could count for contributions or if we needed him to make a statement or an appearance somewhere where it was important to show solidarity.”

""After he retired Aaron devoted his attention to business and charity, setting up programs and scholarships for Black students. In 1999, he became the first Black majority owner of a BMW franchise, and he lobbied for efforts encouraging more young Black athletes to play baseball.""

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred issued a statement Friday about the decision to take this year's All-Star festivities out of Atlanta:

“Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box. In 2020, MLB became the first professional sports league to join the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States. We proudly used our platform to encourage baseball fans and communities throughout our country to perform their civic duty and actively participate in the voting process. Fair access to voting continues to have our game’s unwavering support.”

Georgia governor Brian Kemp signed a controversial elections law bill on March 26 that severely restricts voting rights.

ESPN's Mina Kimes shared a screenshot from a New York Times article written by Nick Corasaniti and Reid J. Epstein about the most significant changes to voting in the state of Georgia under the new bill:

Atlanta's Truist Park was awarded the All-Star Game in May 2019. The 41,000-seat stadium has been home of the Braves since 2017.

This was going to be the first time Atlanta hosted the Midsummer Classic since 2000.

"No. 3 Arizona Stuns Paige Bueckers, No. 1 UConn to Reach National Title Game","Eric Gay/Associated Press

The No. 3 Arizona Wildcats pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the year, defeating No. 1 UConn and Paige Bueckers, 69-59, in the Final Four.

UConn (28-2) picks up just its second loss of the season, having gone undefeated since a three-point defeat to No. 19 Arkansas in late January. The program was looking to win a national championship for the first time since 2016.

Now it's the Wildcats moving on to the title game for the first time in program history after making its Final Four debut on Friday.

Aari McDonald dominated from start to finish to hand UConn its fourth straight loss in the Final Four and keep the title drought alive in Connecticut going for at least another year.

Arizona now faces No. 1 Stanford on Sunday night for the championship.

Christyn Williams, G, UConn Huskies: 20 points, 5 rebounds, 2 steals

Aari Goes Off on Huskies

UConn freshman Paige Bueckers was unquestionably the most hyped player heading into the Final Four. Arizona's Aari McDonald made sure the Huskies guard didn't live up to it. In fact, McDonald supplanted Bueckers early on as the player to watch.

The senior guard was absolutely electric.

McDonald went off for 15 points in the first half with four three-pointers as the Wildcats had the Huskies on their heels early on. UConn never led at any point on Friday. McDonald was a large reason why.

Even when UConn found a way to slow her down in the third quarter, there was little the Huskies could do to keep her off the scoresheet. After posting just two points in the third, McDonald came right back with nine more in the fourth quarter to help close out a win against a flailing Huskies team.

It wasn't just that the Wildcats weren't supposed to be in this position—building a 14-point lead in the first half after entering the game as 14-point underdogs, per ESPN—it's that UConn is almost never in this position. Head coach Geno Auriemma's clubs are known for their discipline and defense but neither paid off on Friday.

As McDonald delivered dagger after dagger, all the Huskies could do was intentionally foul and try to extend the game. It didn't work.

Arizona's incredible run continues and the Huskies head home without a title after a magnificent season once again.

Bueckers, Huskies Bounced Again

It might not be long before UConn is hoisting another national title trophy again, but it'll at least be another year.

A program built by Auriemma that once had pundits questioning if any college team could compete with them has seen its armor significantly damaged. Auriemma is established enough that it's not worth questioning if UConn will be back. It's more a matter of when.

With Bueckers in the program, the answer is more than likely soon.

The Minnesota native became just the fifth freshman in women's basketball history to notch at least 100 points in an NCAA tournament, according to ESPN, joining Tamika Catchings, Cheryl Miller, Breanna Stewart and Clarissa Davis. This is only the start of what's likely to become an epic career.

But it was a rather forgetful night for the Huskies overall.

UConn shot just 35.7 percent from the field and struggled mightily getting to the rim. With 3:22 left to play, the Huskies made just four of their 19 layup attempts and made five three-pointers on the night total. That wasn't going to cut it against an Arizona club carrying all the momentum.

The Huskies couldn't shoot themselves back into the game late and Arizona wasn't going to be baited into mistakes.

A rare Tom Brady autographed card—a 2000 Playoff Contenders Championship Rookie Ticket—sold for $2,252,855.00 in a Lelands auction Friday night.

Beckett Grading Services gave the card an overall grade of 8.5, which represents near-mint condition, and graded the autograph at a 9. The card is labeled No. 99 out of 100.

Here's a portion of the official auction listing:

""To celebrate Brady's greatness, we are proud to offer his ultimate rookie card: the 2000 Playoff Contenders Championship Rookie Ticket #144 Tom Brady Rookie Autograph card. ... We feel the autograph compares favorably for eye appeal and signature strength with any other graded 10 on the market, if not better than other 10's we have seen. This card was purchased on eBay over a decade ago and has been tucked away in a private collection since then.

The sale comes on the heels of a March auction where another version of the same card sold for a then-record $1.32 million, per ESPN's Tom VanHaaren.

Sports collectibles, led by trading cards, have enjoyed a massive boom during the coronavirus pandemic, and that surge has continued in a major way during the early stages of 2021.

"MLB All-Star Game, Draft Moved from Atlanta After GA Voting Restrictions Passed","Brynn Anderson/Associated Press

Major League Baseball announced Friday that it is relocating the 2021 MLB All-Star Game and MLB draft, which were both scheduled to take place in Atlanta.

The Athletic's Lindsey Adler tweeted a statement released by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred on the matter:

The decision comes on the heels of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signing legislation last week, which critics—including the ACLU, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Southern Poverty Law Center—say restricts voting rights.

The Atlanta Braves released the following statement regarding MLB's decision:

As part of the statement, the Braves noted that they are ""disappointed"" and said ""businesses, employees and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.""

Per Nick Corasaniti of the New York Times, the legislation was spearheaded by Georgia Republicans and it will result in stricter identification requirements for absentee ballots, as well as fewer drop boxes for ballots.

Also, those who can vote with provisional ballots will be limited, and it will become a crime to provide food or drink to those waiting in line to vote.

The changes have been condemned by Democrats, including President Joe Biden, whose victory over incumbent Donald Trump in the presidential election was aided by a win in Georgia.

Opinion: The Derek Chauvin trial is a chance to tell a different story,"Cole Brown is a political commentator and author of the book Greyboy: Finding Blackness in a White World. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) The Derek Chauvin trial is technically the second trial in my lifetime to be at once ubiquitous and hugely consequential. I was a newborn during the first.

A jury acquitted O.J. Simpson of murdering his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman on October 3, 1995, two weeks after I was born. The outcome divided the nation along racial lines -- nearly 75% of White Americans believed Simpson was guilty at the time of the verdict, compared to roughly 20% of Black Americans. The trial was a wrestling match over the particularities of the case -- the infamous glove, phone recording and forensic evidence -- but also so much more. It was about celebrity, culpability and consequence. It bore the weight of race, discrimination and a local police department that acted as enemy combatants in Black neighborhoods. Most of all, it bore the weight of Rodney King.

The King trial in 1992 was strikingly similar to this week's Chauvin trial. It centered on police violence and videotape -- the recording in that case was of L.A. County police officers kicking and beating King with nightsticks for 15 minutes as more than a dozen of their colleagues looked on. King survived but suffered skull fractures, broken teeth and permanent brain damage.

Four officers were ultimately tried for excessive force against King. All four were found not guilty.

Riots followed the King verdict. For five days, violence and arson tore apart South Central Los Angeles. In the end, there were 50 deaths, over 6,000 arrests, and approximately $1 billion in property damage.

The Rodney King verdict and the riots that followed heightened the racialized stakes of the Simpson trial. It became a proxy war for those in the struggle against biased policing. That struggle permeated the courtroom.

Years later, in the ESPN documentary O.J.: Made in America, when asked whether ""there are members of the jury that voted to acquit O.J. because of Rodney King?"" Carrie Bess, a juror, responded simply, ""Yes.""

Much has been written about the Simpson verdict and how it served as a strange consolation to the Black community. The verdict communicated that, if we are to live beneath the boot of an unjust structure, as the Los Angeles Police Department clearly was, we can at least hope for the equal application of that injustice. As writer Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote of the verdict, it was the "" most shocking statement of pure equality since the civil-rights movement .""

The outcome recalibrated how many thought of the justice system, who it victimized and what was possible. It provided a counterexample to the prevailing narrative of Black victimization at the hands of the justice system. For many, it inspired an emotion akin to hope. Unfortunately, that feeling was fleeting.

At 25 years old, I can't recall a time in my life when the justice system appeared to me as anything but broken. I was in the 10th grade when Trayvon Martin was killed. He was my age. I was in the 11th grade when Jordan Davis was killed . He was my age. I was a freshman in college when Michael Brown was killed. He, too, was my age. I spent my formative years watching unarmed Black people -- Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray and many others -- die. In nearly every case, I watched their killers roam forth with impunity.

The Chauvin trial is a chance to tell a different story.

The Chauvin trial bears all the key elements of the Rodney King and O.J. Simpson trials combined. Like in Simpson's trial, the eyes of a nation will be trained upon Minnesota in the coming month. Thanks to streaming, each argument will be accessible to millions and viewed live.

Like in the King trial, Americans have witnessed firsthand the brutality of the accused -- brutality so vicious that calls for punishment are more widespread than we're accustomed to seeing in trials of police violence.

Soon, we will hear from Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who is expected to testify that Chauvin -- one of his former officers -- used excessive force in the encounter with George Floyd. It is difficult to recall another case when a police chief testifying against one of his own even seemed possible.

Just like the cases nearly three decades ago, this trial contains the power to shape how my generation of Americans views its justice system. It won't erase the past. It is something short of the "" referendum on how far America has come in its quest for equality and justice "" that the Floyd family attorney, Benjamin Crump, says it is. Floyd's death itself is too great a wrong to refashion any hopeful narratives of progress towards equality in the eyes of the law.

Instead, the Chauvin trial will test the depths of our inequality. The trial will demonstrate whether or not the American justice system is capable of executing its most basic function -- punishing the depraved.

Should Chauvin be convicted of the crimes we watched him commit, few will be able to rejoice at the salvation of our justice system. But we will release a silent sigh of relief that the system is not totally illegitimate -- a small victory.

But should Chauvin be acquitted, the result will speak a message of unsalvageable injustice to a generation of Americans already familiar with too many other examples. I expect to see riots like the ones that followed Rodney King's verdict.

And years on, well after the initial outrage has quieted, we will remember Derek Chauvin before estimating the meaning of justice in our nation.",2021-04-02 00:00:00

I have never seen the George Floyd video.

I am not watching the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for almost 10 minutes in broad daylight over a fake $20 bill.

As a journalist, I should have seen the brutal video. As a journalist, I should watch the trial and watch all the pundits dissect all the testimony to put together what it all means.

As a journalist, I should know more fully about the testimony and the witnesses behind what I have heard about or seen in the headlines: The firefighter who tried to intervene. The teen who recorded the video and stayed up nights apologizing to Floyd for not doing more to help him. The store clerk who took pity on Floyd in his last hours. But, just like so many of my friends and family, I'm completely avoiding the trial.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion: How to stop a killing like that of George Floyd from ever happening again,"Louis Dekmar, a 44-year law enforcement veteran, is chief of police in LaGrange, Georgia. Collette Flanagan, founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality , is a leading national advocate for peace and justice. Both serve on the Council on Criminal Justice Task Force on Policing . The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) First there was the agonizing video, showing Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin grinding his knee into George Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as three of his colleagues watched and didn't intervene. Then came the protests , a national wave of outrage coursing through communities large and small.

Now the nation is watching Chauvin's trial, underway in a Minnesota courtroom -- nearly 10 months after Floyd's death. It's a chance for the wheels of justice to finally turn. And it's a moment to ask ourselves:

If another officer were to engage in similar misconduct today, would his colleagues again refuse to step in and stop it?

We serve together on the Council on Criminal Justice Task Force on Policing -- a Georgia police chief and a parent who founded Mothers Against Police Brutality after her son was killed by police in 2013. Not surprisingly, we don't see eye-to-eye on everything. But like our nine task force colleagues , we do agree on what's needed to ensure officers don't stand idly by as tragedies like Floyd's death unfold.

For most people, the reasons underlying an officer's duty to intervene when a peer engages in wrongdoing seem obvious: protecting lives, serving justice and holding police accountable. And officers agree. A 2017 survey found that 84% of police officers believe they should intercede when witnessing a colleague use excessive force.

But changing a deep-rooted culture to make sure that happens is a formidable task.

Officers are loyal to their peers. They depend on their partners in life-or-death circumstances, making it difficult to oppose them. Some may fear that intervening will provoke retaliation or render them outcasts, scuttling their careers. Others may rationalize that bad actions are justified because they serve the greater good. And, though it's hard to challenge a superior in any workplace, the rigid hierarchy of police agencies makes calling out the boss even tougher.

What's more, adopting rules requiring officers to intervene only goes so far. The Minneapolis Police Department, for example, had such a policy on the books the day Chauvin, a department veteran, kneeled fatally on Floyd's neck. It required officers to ""either stop or attempt to stop another sworn employee when force is being inappropriately applied or is no longer required."" And yet, as bystanders implored Chauvin to remove his knee, three young Minneapolis officers failed to step in -- although one of them, Thomas Lane , asked Chauvin if Floyd should be rolled on his side, noting that he thought Floyd might be having a medical emergency.

The episode provides a textbook example of why written policy and police academy training are not enough. To prevent misconduct -- and reduce the injuries and fatalities it can cause -- we must weave the duty to intervene into the very fiber of law enforcement agencies and enforce fidelity to its practice with both incentives and sanctions. Accountability must apply not just to officers who engage in misconduct but also to those who bear witness to it and those who are in a position to intervene and fail to do so.

Last month, the House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which requires federal law enforcement officers to intervene in cases of excessive force. The law, which faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, also mandates that state and local governments receiving federal funds for policing establish relevant training programs for officers.

That's a start. But our task force reviewed the research evidence around duty-to-intervene policies and found that, to be effective, they must include certain critical elements . One such element is clear documentation of the type of prohibited officer conduct that requires intervention. Agencies also should integrate the policy into all facets of hiring and training, and reinforce it with instruction that enhances awareness of biases and stereotypes that may discourage an officer from stepping in.

We also recommend that agencies require mandatory reporting of all manner of misbehavior, including the use of racist language, substance abuse, or other signs of officer stress that could lead to trouble down the line. Currently, some police agencies require such reporting but many do not.

More broadly, duty-to-intervene rules must be part of a systemic effort to eliminate the code-of-silence mentality wherever it exists in police culture. Supervisors need to model appropriate behavior and promptly address negative stereotypes, racial biases and power dynamics that allow officers to justify misconduct. Department leaders should praise officers for intervening, an action that research shows can help convince colleagues to do the right thing.

Forging a culture that encourages officers to step up when witnessing misconduct will not be accomplished with a few new rules and stern messages from watch commanders. It requires top-to-bottom changes in recruitment, hiring, supervision, accountability, discipline, and technology -- and often, amending state laws and community standards.

But this is not a choice for American policing; it's a necessity. And we believe the results can be profound.

If done right, duty-to-intervene and mandatory reporting requirements hold promise to prevent trauma and deaths during encounters between police and community members, strengthen their trust in the officers sworn to protect them and reduce racial disparities in policing. Duty-to-intervene policies also serve the interests of officer safety, reducing the risk of injury or death related to the unwarranted use of force.

Those benefits make the journey to get there well worth the effort. But most importantly, it's simply the right thing to do.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Doctor: Arkansas anti-trans law is completely unethical,"Jack Turban MD ( @jack_turban ) is a fellow in child and adolescent psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) As physicians, my colleagues and I have the honor and privilege to help people through some of the most difficult times of their lives. Along with this privilege come some challenging situations. Once at three in the morning, I was paged to see a patient going through alcohol withdrawal. The moment I walked into his room, he grabbed my pager from my scrubs and threw it against the wall. He screamed homophobic slurs in my face. I was tired. My shoulders tightened with anxiety, and I steeled myself against memories of middle school bullies summoned by this patient's screaming.

I pushed through and made sure he got the medical interventions he needed. Had he not received this timely medical care, his substance use would have threatened his life. My medical training taught me to prioritize his health over my pain at his words or beliefs that homophobia like his is morally wrong. It is my job to do that. Similarly, I would expect a doctor who thinks alcohol use disorder is a ""moral failing"" to still offer this patient evidence-based medical care.

Sadly, not all politicians think the same way . This week, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed the so-called Medical Ethics and Diversity Act into law. The law allows a wide range of health care workers -- doctors, pharmacists and even insurance companies -- to refuse to provide non-emergency healthcare based on personal ""moral"" objections. This new law is dangerous and directly contradicts the professional responsibilities we have as health care providers.

As a gay man in medicine, I'll be the first to tell you that we should have diversity in the profession. It's important to have physicians from all races, ethnicities, religious backgrounds, gender identities and sexual orientations. I applaud that idea of a bill that promotes diversity in medicine. But Arkansas's new "" Medical Ethics and Diversity "" law does no such thing. It is unethical and targets diverse patients, trying to take away their health care.

The most obvious damage this law will cause for the people of Arkansas will be to limit access to certain treatments that have become politicized. This will likely include things like gender-affirming surgeries or medications for transgender people and abortion care . Of note, the state legislature also just passed a law t hat would explicitly outlaw gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth, despite opposition from major medical organizations and data linking gender-affirming care to lower odds of transgender people considering suicide. That bill is awaiting the governor's signature.

But Dr. Jennifer Gunter, obstetrician gynecologist, women's health expert and author of ""The Menopause Manifesto,"" noted in an interview with me that the negative impacts of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act may go beyond these highly politicized treatments. ""What if your insurer decides your cancer is a result of immoral behavior because you were once a smoker? The potential for abuse is huge and frightening.""

This new law means that health care can be blocked at various stages along the health care delivery chain. Let's say a doctor agrees to prescribe your medication -- a pharmacist could still refuse to dispense it based on whatever ""moral"" grounds they assert. Even if the physician and pharmacist agree to give you the medication, your insurance company could refuse to pay for it.

Proponents of the law have been quick to point out that it only applies to ""non-emergency care."" But we need to keep in mind that people die from ""non-emergencies."" Let's say a lesbian woman lives in a small town where there are only a few doctors. She develops diabetes, and the doctors in the area refuse to examine her and give her insulin because they think living as an out lesbian woman goes against their personal ""morals."" This woman's diabetes will progress. She will eventually lose feeling in her hands and feet. She may become blind. Her diabetes will progress and eventually she will end up in the emergency room, where the doctors will need to treat the emergency. But at that point, it will likely be too late, and she will die an early death.

This bill has left many people in Arkansas horrified. I spoke with one of them recently: Chris Attig, an 11-year US Army Veteran who lives in Little Rock, and is the father of a transgender child. He pointed out that Arkansas is a small state, and that almost all of the major hospitals are ""faith-based."" He worries that if these hospitals refuse to treat trans people, then his son will simply go without medical care.

When I asked why there has been so much legislation about transgender people in Arkansas this year, State Rep. Deborah Ferguson told me she believes conservative groups in the area are simply out of issues, ""Honestly I think the Family Council has run out of things to fight about. They need to look for something to validate their existence."" State Sen. Kim Hammer , lead sponsor of The Medical Ethics and Diversity Act in the Senate, did not -- as of the time of this writing -- respond to my question on what prompted his introduction of the bill.

It seems clear that the new law will lead to direct negative impacts on health, and potentially deaths. But there will also be more insidious indirect effects. Research has consistently shown that bills like this cause cultural shifts. If the local news and politicians tell LGBTQ people that they can be discriminated against in health care, people are likely going to think it's okay to harass them in other settings. Sadly, LGBTQ people often take those messages to heart. As a psychiatrist, I sit with many LGBTQ people who have been told all their lives that being LGBTQ is wrong or amoral. At a certain point, they start to internalize those messages, resulting in low self-esteem, anxiety and depression. This is a primary reason for high rates of suicide among LGBTQ people.

One of the best ways of illuminating the risks posed by this Arkansas law is a major study of how marriage equality impacted adolescent mental health. In states that passed marriage equality before it was legal nationwide, adolescent suicide attempts dropped. It obviously wasn't because teenagers were getting married; it was because these conversations about the rights of LGBTQ people impact mental health dramatically. Similarly, laws permitting refusal of services to LGBTQ people have been shown to have substantial negative impacts on mental health.

The new law will also likely negatively impact Arkansas's economy. Similar lawsuits have been challenged in the courts, resulting in substantial legal fees the state would need to pay. The Idaho attorney general's office, for instance, estimated that it would cost Idaho approximately $1 million if it needed to fund a protracted legal battle over an anti-trans birth certificate bill. Some states have also seen major companies pull resources out of their state in response to similar legislation. These are resources that would be better spent fighting Covid-19 and other health challenges impacting the state.

Doctors and medical professionals train long and hard to have the privilege to care for people during some of the most challenging times in their lives. This comes with responsibilities. As a profession, we have dedicated ourselves to putting health above all other beliefs we may hold. The new Arkansas law goes against these medical ethics. I can only hope that, despite this amoral legislation, the doctors of Arkansas will uphold their duty to treat all people.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Jill Biden's first ladyship is a long way from cookie bake-offs and state dinners (opinion),"(CNN) Dr. Jill Biden is back in the classroom this month, carrying a course load of three classes as she returns to her full-time teaching job at Northern Virginia Community College. Her work looks a bit different after a year off on the campaign trail. Two of the classes are hybrid, featuring live-streamed instruction as part of the Covid protocols not yet necessary when she took a leave of absence last January. She also returns with a new title: First lady of the United States.

In retaining her full-time job, Biden is breaking tradition — and a glass ceiling that has hovered over first ladies throughout US history. It is the second time she has made this particularly kind of history: when her husband was vice president, she became the first second lady of the United States to hold a full-time job. As second lady, she not only spent her time grading papers and teaching classes, but leveraging her political role to fight for things like free community college . That dedication no doubt comes in part from her career as a teacher at a community college, a job that she sees as both a calling and a form of service.

Her determination to continue that career as first lady comes at an important moment. Millions of women in the US have been forced out of the workforce by the pandemic, their careers put on hold as they pick up the work of childcare and education caused by shuttered schools and gendered pay inequities that lead opposite-sex couples to sacrifice the woman's job first. By both keeping her job against expectations and speaking openly about the meaning and value of her career, Biden has underscored just how important women's careers are, and how necessary it is to provide opportunities for those unwillingly displaced from the workforce.

In some ways, it sounds like a retrograde conversation: praising a woman for having a career feels like a throwback to the 1960s. That is due in large part to the retrograde nature of the position of first lady. It comes with no defined duties (and no paycheck), and yet has been larded with so many responsibilities and expectations over the centuries that it has been a minefield for the women who suddenly find themselves filling the role.

That's because the role of first lady grew out of presumptions of women's inequality. For the first 130 years, first ladies were unable to vote and unlikely to pursue careers while married. They might have served as their husband's (or in some cases, father's) confidante, smoothed prickly diplomatic conflicts, and hosted state dinners and parties, but they did so under the expectation that that was what wives of well-connected men did.

US First Lady Jill Biden speaks with a student as she tours Benjamin Franklin Elementary School in Meriden, Connecticut, on March 3, 2021.

The position that emerged in that first century of presidents and first ladies reflected the values of the time. The legal notion of coverture meant that a woman's legal identity was subsumed under her husband's, while the cultural notion of domesticity relegated women to the care of home and family. As such, the first lady became an extension of her husband, her work largely limited to social affairs.

Even as women's citizenship grew following expansion of suffrage in 1920 and the decades following, the role of first lady remained fully rooted in those values. A few first ladies, most notably Eleanor Roosevelt, exercised political influence and pursued projects and causes that were important to them. That became more the norm in the 1960s, as Lady Bird Johnson -- who had two bachelor's degrees and a successful business career and, behind the scenes, advised her husband -- used her position to push for projects like highway beautification, a cause still tied to domestic ideas of cleanliness and beauty.

The strains of the position became increasingly visible starting in the 1970s. As second-wave feminism and changes in the economy made dual-income households much more common , the image of the first lady as a kind of volunteer hostess grew more and more outdated.

Instead, first ladies had to set aside successful careers or vocations of their own to support their husbands' new position. The clash in values occasionally broke through: Betty Ford used her role as a kind of bully pulpit, pressuring her husband on issues like reproductive rights and representation on the Supreme Court.

But the strains became especially visible in the Clinton years in ways that followed Hillary Clinton throughout her political life. On the campaign trail in 1992, the successful lawyer found herself baking cookies in penance for a comment about the importance of her career.

""I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,"" she said when questioned about her work during her husband's time as governor of Arkansas, ""but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.""

The outrage that followed grew so intense that Clinton ultimately submitted to a cookie bake-off with Barbara Bush to demonstrate her domestic bode fides. Journalists and Republicans continued to hold her professional ambitions against her throughout her tenure as first lady.

Clinton had broken a kind of glass ceiling of her own as first lady, having been put in charge of a substantial, if ultimately unsuccessful, policy portfolio. Precisely because of the failure of healthcare reform and the lashing she took in the media, future administrations were hesitant to replicate that model. But they also shied away from it because the women who followed were not especially interested in being policymakers. Laura Bush made clear early in her husband's career that she did not see herself as a political wife.

And Michelle Obama, who had a successful career as a lawyer and hospital administrator, chafed at the sacrifices required by her new position. When her husband won the Iowa caucus in 2008, she had to leave her job at the University of Chicago Medical Center. ""It had been painful to step away from my work,"" she wrote in her memoir, ""but there was no choice: My family needed me, and that mattered more."" She didn't want to be a Hillary Clinton -- though she pursued important projects as first lady, she had never longed for a career in politics -- but the options open to a first lady seemed limited to projects that complemented her husband's agenda.

That's what is so remarkable about Jill Biden's decision to maintain her separate career. Precisely because her ambitions are not aimed at the political sphere, but are wholly separate, her choice conveys a kind of independence that former first ladies did not, and likely could not, claim.

As first lady, she uses her title ""Dr."" (despite some conservative protestation ), a reflection of the education doctorate she earned in 2007. In the classroom, she keeps her other title under wraps. ""I am an English teacher at NOVA — not First Lady,"" she wrote to campus colleagues after the inauguration. ""I am not mentioning it in my classes AT ALL. Thanks for honoring my teacher identity.""

And she has done all this without forfeiting her own voice in policy issues she cares about, from community college to her work with veterans. Though it looks much different from, say, Clinton's path through the first lady's office, it is empowering in a deeper way: Biden has managed to carve a path through these awkward offices by offering her service but never sacrificing herself.

That she has been able to carve a space for herself that is not circumscribed by her husband's role is a significant step, one that has the potential to transform the way Americans see the office. The country does not need a partner impressed into service because of their spouse's job.

If the position is going to remain, it should reflect the values of equality and autonomy that emerged long after the job of first lady did. Biden's decision gives us a chance to begin radically rethinking what the position looks like. And more than that: it models just how vital it is that women have autonomy over their lives and careers, something that will be vitally necessary as we work to rebuild in the aftermath of the pandemic.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion: Searing testimony in Chauvin trial may not be legally relevant. We still need to hear it,"Elliot Williams is a CNN legal analyst. He is a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and a principal at The Raben Group, a national public affairs and strategic communications firm. Follow him on Twitter @elliotcwilliams . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Not every piece of evidence presented in a criminal trial is relevant to its outcome. Over the course of the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin thus far, we have heard a number of witness statements that are irrelevant to the central legal matter at issue in the case: is Chauvin legally responsible, under Minnesota's murder statute, for the death of George Floyd?

The defense could have objected to some of this witness testimony or the judge could have easily struck it down, but they didn't. And that's a good thing.

Very few consequential facts are in dispute in Chauvin's trial. It is not up for debate that on May 25, 2020, Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes; graphic video evidence of this fact was seared into the public consciousness nearly a year ago and that footage, along with other clips from different angles, have already been admitted into court. It is not up for debate that Floyd died on that day, or that his name became an eponym for a galvanizing movement against America's centuries-long failure to treat Black people -- and particularly Black men in the criminal justice system -- with basic dignity.

Up for legal debate is whether Chauvin ""caused"" Floyd's death under Minnesota law . Prosecutors need not prove that Chauvin's actions were the sole cause of Floyd's death, but that his actions were a substantial causal factor in the death.

The answer to this question is obvious to me. I, however, am not one of the 12 jurors in this trial.

Nevertheless, what will matter most in the trial will be the testimony of medical professionals and toxicologists who will provide evidence about Floyd's body and physical condition. The jury will then be tasked with deciding whether they are convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Chauvin, who pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, ought to be convicted. (Chauvin's attorney said in his opening statements on Monday that the only ""just verdict"" would be to find Mr. Chauvin not guilty.)

The witness testimony we've seen thus far has been fascinating. However, some of the most powerful moments did not speak to any material fact at issue in the trial, but were gripping expressions of emotion as eyewitnesses worked through their guilt, and even shame, in front of a national audience. Jurors, of course, are human and could likely be swayed by such powerful human testimony.

For instance, Charles McMillian , a man who watched officers detain Floyd, broke down after watching a video of the arrest. McMillian, who is Black, said that he interacted with Chauvin just days before Floyd's death, and attempted to engage Floyd as he was being detained, shouting, ""Mr. Floyd, Mr. Floyd just comply, get in the car because you can't win.""

Christopher Martin, a 19-year-old cashier at the convenience store Cup Foods, testified that Floyd's death could have been avoided had he responded differently to what he thought was a $20 counterfeit bill Floyd used to pay for cigarettes (the store manager later asked another worker to call the police). Similarly, both Genevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter and EMT at the scene, and Darnella Frazier, the 17-year-old who filmed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, shed tears on the stand and questioned what more they could have done to prevent his death. Frazier told the court, ""It's been nights I stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life.""

Despite its emotional impact, none of this evidence proves or disproves any material questions about whether Chauvin's actions were the substantial causal factor behind Floyd's death. Had the defense objected to some of these witness statements, the judge would probably have had reasonable grounds to disallow them. We can't be sure if the defense made a tactical decision not to object -- after all, perception matters at trial and it would have been damaging to Chauvin for his lawyers to be seen as combative towards grieving members of the community.

That said, while much of the testimonial evidence has not been legally consequential thus far, it does speak to important aspects of the nation's reactions to Floyd's death. Some of the witnesses highlighted the widespread guilt that so many felt over their failure to confront the gross inequalities baked into our daily lives that led to Floyd's death. They wondered whether they were complicit in perpetuating racial injustice, and whether they could have done anything more to combat it.

McMillian, meanwhile, might not have been conscious of it, but he spoke to the fears of just about every Black man in America when he shared that interactions with law enforcement are so often fraught with peril. His advice to Floyd just moments before the 46-year-old's death is one many Black Americans have internalized: it may just make more sense to get into the car or do whatever else an officer asks -- however unreasonable -- because you just can't win.

No one can say whether Chauvin will be convicted. The trial is still ongoing, and the central legal dispute at the heart of the case -- the technical cause of Floyd's death -- remains an open one. Layer on that the fact that it is difficult to convict police officers for their on-duty conduct, and it is clear that this proceeding is far from over.

So far, Chauvin's defense team has not objected to some testimony that has made it into the trial. In doing so, they have provided us with a window into a nation's grief and the fact that we can, and should, all do better.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion: Women are leading the way on biology's frontier. Here's how to open up all of science to them,"Brett Marie Sansbury, PhD, is the Leader of Discovery Research and Natalia Rivera-Torres, PhD, is Laboratory Operations Coordinator and a research scientist in the Gene Editing Institute at ChristianaCare's Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute. The opinions expressed here are their own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) A decade ago, as undergraduate women pursuing degrees and futures in science, we were given regular signals that we were outsiders. From applying for research positions only to see that many of the most competitive labs were staffed largely by males to professors simply not engaging with us as they did our male peers, we learned quickly that science is too often unwelcoming to women. Perhaps this is why only three in 10 scientists worldwide are women, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics .

This is not only detrimental to women, but also to scientific progress, as it can prevent women with contributions to offer from entering the field. That is why we are calling on scientists, educators and student advisers to start breaking down the barriers facing women in science.

A foundation built by women

Despite the under-representation of women in science, some of our most critical breakthroughs have been driven by women. There are, of course, famous examples: Marie Curie and countless other historic, scientific trailblazers. But there are also contemporary women scientists breaking new ground. There is perhaps no better examples than Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Dr. Jennifer Doudna, who in 2020 became the first women to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry . They won for the development of CRISPR, the genetic scissors that allow us to edit DNA -- and consequently launched a new chapter in science and the human experience.

Their accomplishments helped revolutionize gene editing, which drives our research today. In our lab at the Gene Editing Institute at ChristianaCare, we're two women in a lab that is nearly two-thirds women, working in a field that has been propelled by women. And that's inspirational.

Doudna and Charpentier's work was made possible by the women -- and one woman in particular -- who came before them: Rosalind Franklin, the pioneering scientist who was the first to capture an image of DNA, revealing its double helix shape. While three men won the Nobel Prize for unlocking the mystery of DNA, Franklin's role didn't garner the attention it deserved. (She died before the 1962 Nobel Prize for this work was awarded.)

This is not to understate the many contributions to our understanding of genetics and gene editing made by men, but we believe that it is the women working in the field who are the scientific heirs to Franklin's achievements. She was integral in revealing the instruction manual of life and now, Charpentier and Doudna have given us the tools to edit and rewrite it.

These women circumvented the hurdles that have long faced women in science and society has reaped the rewards. We must now remove these hurdles to allow more women and, critically, other underrepresented groups, into science. For example, according to the National Science Foundation, it's estimated that, as of 2015, 3.4% of scientists and engineers were Black or Latina women. That won't do.

We want each subsequent generation of women in science to face fewer barriers to reshaping the field and making the next breakthrough. This is not only what's right -- it also makes for better science and everyone benefits from that.

How to foster women in science

Supporting women scientists means starting early -- making science feel accessible to all by showing students examples of scientists who look like them and creating a collaborative culture in the lab.

The first sounds simple, but requires elementary, middle school and high school teachers to do the work early and intentionally. They need to show and tell the stories of scientists from all walks of life. And scientists must engage with the public. Only then can we change the image that comes to mind when kids hear the word ""scientist."" It's no longer exclusively frizzy, white-haired Albert Einstein; it's people who look like us.

Then, we need to ensure that classrooms and labs are places of inclusion and collaboration. Like many women, in the past some male faculty members have spoken down to us and engaged less with us than with our male peers. We saw few women leading labs and we could tell less was expected of us inside and outside the classroom.

Universities must act to reshape this culture by evaluating their faculty demographics and developing structures to increase the numbers of women and minority groups employed by their institutions. Along with correcting inequities in compensation, university leaders should support policies like family leave that enable women to achieve tenure with fewer barriers. By creating space for women and minority science educators to thrive, they can inspire the next generation of women and minority scientists.

Working in a lab that is designed to support women and diverse perspectives, we know the value of women's representation and mentorship. The Gene Editing Institute and its director Dr. Eric Kmiec have worked to ensure this support by making equality a foundational principle within our laboratory, fostering an environment for female scientists to succeed, championing our research breakthroughs and elevating female scientists to key leadership roles.

Charpentier and Doudna have shown us that when we are breaking into a space that has excluded women, the path forward isn't to leave others behind -- it's to work together. In 2021, those in the science community must commit to helping others who have been shut out.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion: Matt Gaetz's diversionary tactics aren't working,"Jennifer Rodgers is a former federal prosecutor, adjunct professor of clinical law at NYU School of Law, lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School and a CNN legal analyst. The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) It is now public knowledge that Rep. Matt Gaetz is under investigation by the Justice Department, which is reportedly looking into whether he paid for the travel expenses of a 17-year-old girl across state lines to entice her into sexual activity. And Gaetz did not take the breaking of the news quietly.

Jennifer Rodgers

The investigation apparently developed out of the federal case against Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax collector who stands charged with sex trafficking, identification document fraud, stalking and other offenses. Greenberg was indicted last summer and faces trial in June. Greenberg has pleaded not guilty.

Recognizing that being under investigation for sex trafficking is a very bad look, as soon as the news broke, Gaetz immediately sprung into action to defend himself against and divert attention from the reported allegations.

Unfortunately, Gaetz's responses likely only made things worse. It is a bad thing -- not to mention likely a violation of Justice Department regulations -- when information about investigations leaks into the public realm, and it is understandable that Gaetz would be upset by this reporting about him. But if I may offer Congressman Gaetz a piece of free legal advice: Hire yourself a good lawyer if you don't already have one and make that person's job easier by keeping your mouth shut.

Gaetz could and should have stuck with a plain old denial, saying that he did nothing wrong, does not believe he will be charged and looks forward to being vindicated, as a defense lawyer might have said on his behalf if given the chance. Instead, though, Gaetz went much further. He denied the existence of the 17-year-old and said ""no part of the allegations against me are true.""",2021-04-01 00:00:00
Opinion: Why Joe Biden is a man in a hurry,"Frida Ghitis , ( @fridaghitis ) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) President Joe Biden may look relaxed, but don't let that deceive you. He is a man in a hurry. Behind that seemingly laid-back smile, he's moving at a frenetic pace.

Two months into his presidency, Biden has already notched up major achievements in his far-reaching agenda. In addition to enacting a raft of executive actions, including rejoining the Paris climate agreement, he has signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law, launching a frontal assault on the pandemic, shoring up the finances of struggling Americans, supporting local governments and expanding access to health care. He has also reengaged our allies and moved uncommonly fast to nominate a diverse group of federal judges to the bench.

Whether or not you agree with his priorities, it's undeniable that the scope of his actions in the last 70-some days has been enormous. And Biden -- the man Trump frequently derided as ""sleepy"" -- is just getting started. His $2 trillion infrastructure proposal is his latest move in what is already one of the most ambitious presidencies in decades. And it's all happening at a dizzying speed.

Why is Biden in such a hurry?

Part of it is the political calendar. The president has a better shot at legislative success before the midterm elections. Both former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump were stymied after the opposition party made significant gains in the 2010 and 2018 midterm elections. Biden could face the same fate in 2022, especially since Democrats already have a tenuous hold on both chambers of Congress. But there's more.

At 78, Biden is the oldest president in US history. He may also be one of the most introspective.

One of the changes that comes with age is the growing realization that your time is limited. It's not just a political consideration -- it is a metaphysical and spiritual one. As he approaches 80, Biden has a perspective that may not come as quickly to younger politicians who are more focused on short-term victories.

That's visible in the way he speaks about his plans and his poignant references to their potential impact long into the future. He doesn't just talk about the practical day-to-day effect -- he looks decades ahead and offers the picture of a country that has turned the corner and reaped lasting benefits from having met the challenges of this moment.

During his first formal press conference last week, Biden talked about the urgency of succeeding in the global contest between democracy and autocracy, and how the US must show it can adjust to a changing world. ""This is a battle between the utility of democracy in the 21st century and autocracies,"" he said, adding, ""Your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy?""

The same future-focused appeal surfaced on Wednesday when he unveiled his infrastructure plan . ""We have to move now,"" he said, ""Because I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say this was the moment that America won the future.""

It is one of the paradoxes of Biden's presidency that he is trying to secure as many victories as soon as possible, with an eye toward shaping a distant future. Biden seems to have a particularly acute faith that what he does now may be more fully grasped by future generations.

In the final months of the 2020 campaign, much of Biden's messaging focused on defeating the pandemic. But he always had bigger goals. Some were concrete: creating jobs, upgrading infrastructure, fighting climate change and expanding access to health care. Others were more philosophical or moral. The words ""decency"" and ""soul"" kept coming up.

Biden said from the very start of his presidential bid that he decided to run after neo-Nazis descended on Charlottesville in 2017. Having seen America drift in a frightening direction, Biden said he intended to ""restore the soul of America.""

At any other time, this might have sounded like an empty campaign slogan. But Americans knew what he meant. His presidency is not just about infrastructure or public health, it's about restoring respect for the values the US has sought to advance, however imperfectly, from its founding days: equality, freedom, and an abiding faith in democracy -- all of which were eroded in the past four years.

Biden will inevitably make mistakes and fail to reach some, if not many, of his goals. But his aims are ambitious. He's rushing to bring about the changes that he believes will transform the country in the long term. He's also trying to steer the US away from the ugliness that reared its head in the last four years, and making sure the rest of the world sees a country worth emulating.

Every president worries about his legacy. But Biden is a man driven. He is not just seeking the approval of today's voters. He's trying to shape the country in a way that will change the course of history -- with lasting reverberations long after he's gone. To do that, he has no time to waste.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion: A glimmer of light for world action against the next pandemic,"Michael Bociurkiw ( @WorldAffairsPro) is a global affairs analyst, author of the forthcoming book Digital Pandemic and host of the podcast ""Global Impact."" He is a regular contributor to CNN Opinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) A year into this global pandemic, we have seen anything but an effective, coordinated approach among nations to address the crisis on a global scale. Amid this backdrop, Tuesday's news that a group of countries is pledging to work together to prevent future pandemics can be regarded only as a positive development for the world.

The so-called pandemic treaty to bring greater international cooperation for public health emergencies has been endorsed by more than 20 world leaders -- but not by the US, China, India and Russia -- in an editorial published in several media outlets and on the World Health Organization (WHO) website on Tuesday. The world leaders wrote that they are ""committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for this and future pandemics.""

""We believe that nations should work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response,"" they added.

Though China and the US did not participate in the editorial, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that both countries had a positive reaction to the treaty.

That nations should work together for the good of public health should go without saying. But the exact opposite attitude seems have played itself out in a pandemic that has already killed more than 2.8 million people , infected almost 128 million and caused unprecedented economic dislocation around the world. While it is difficult to say if the treaty will even be worth the paper it is signed on, there should be little dispute on the need to urgently get countries back to working in unison. It is widely acknowledged that the establishment in a majority of countries of herd immunity is required to prevent the disease from spreading, and if wealthy countries continue to practice vaccine nationalism with a 'me first' attitude, Covid-19 will likely remain a terrible scourge for some time to come.

In the EU, an every-man-for-himself mentality has taken hold that makes it doubtful that the 27-nation bloc will ever emerge from this crisis as a stronger steward of its 450 million inhabitants.

If the Covid-19 pandemic response were an exam, many world leaders would have to cheat on their finals to obtain a passing grade. Hence the pandemic treaty initiative appears as something of a diplomatic off-ramp for world leaders to absolve themselves of responsibility for poor handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.

It was a near miracle that several major powers, including France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, even managed to come together to sign a single piece of paper, while back in the corridors of power they are engaged in childlike tit-for-tat diplomacy -- for example, the UK and EU's ongoing battle over AstraZeneca vaccine contracts or EU members breaking with Brussels to obtain vaccines outside of the bloc's strategy.

Despite the assurances from Tedros that support for the treaty is building from major superpowers, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the US had ""some concerns"" about the timing of negotiations for a new treaty.

Also absent from the initial group of treaty supporters is Canada. (The office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not immediately respond to my request for comment.)

While using scarce resources to push for a treaty strikes me as odd in light of the lack of cooperation during the past year, the substance of the proposed treaty raises some crucial issues for improved future pandemic response. It advocates for a ""One Health"" approach to include humans, animals and the planet. This suggests that attention and resources would be earmarked for issues such as climate change, deforestation, poaching and displacement of people. Because virus hotspots are closely tied to environmental change , which is happening at a faster rate than ever, climate needs to be a crucial component of any review of global pandemic response.

As part of pandemic prevention, more resources also need to be allocated for such measures as virus testing laboratories in poorer regions, stockpiling of personal protection equipment, and surveillance.

As for the WHO, it has been widely criticized for its early handling of the pandemic for going easy on China during the first phase and being slow to declare a "" public health emergency of international concern ."" The Geneva-based organization needs to work hard to regain the moral authority to cajole member states into action. That can begin with implementing major reforms demanded by wealthy member states, such as empowering it to have speedier access to areas of disease outbreaks, which will better position it to face pandemics ahead on.

""I'm heartened,"" Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, the medical director of the special pathogens unit at Boston Medical Center, told me. Calling the proposed treaty ambitious, she said that the current International Health Regulations (IHR), which govern what the WHO can or cannot do, are ""not enough to handle the kind of challenges we need moving forward. It is a soft law meaning not much can be done if a member state refuses to build capacity or cooperate in sharing information or samples after an event has occurred.""

The proposed treaty, she said, expands well beyond IHR and may create more incentives for cooperation.

Bhadelia also noted that an improved global health infrastructure for research is also needed (for example to test drug efficacy), as well as equity and access for vaccines and diagnostics.

No matter how succinct and powerful the language, the effectiveness of international treaties is only as good as the political will of the signatory countries.

If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us anything it is that we are an extremely interconnected and interdependent global community. We have learned that viruses do not respect borders and feast mercilessly on disunity and lack of coordination.

For the preservation of humanity itself, current and future governments need to set aside their differences, swallow their pride, and come together to prevent another pandemic of this scale. We can only hope that this proposal takes us closer to that goal.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
What to expect when you're expecting so much from the Quad (Opinion),"Jeffrey W. Hornung is a political scientist at the non-profit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinions at CNN.

(CNN) The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue , better known as the Quad, has been getting a lot of attention recently. When the leaders of the United States, Japan, India and Australia met virtually for their first group meeting on March 12, the meeting was called historic.

Without a doubt, the meeting was indeed historic. Prior to this recent summit, representatives from the Quad countries met only during an unpublicized meeting in 2007. Then, following a 2017 meeting among representatives on the sidelines of an ASEAN summit in Manila, ministerial-level meetings were held in 2019 and 2020 and a third ministerial was held this February . The recent meeting at the leader level was therefore a first, which is what garnered so much attention.

But is this attention warranted? Probably -- but a heavy dose of ""manage your expectations"" may also be required.

The history of the Quad is short. It is rooted in the response these four countries mustered to quickly help in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. While Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pushed for a diplomatic dialogue among these nations in 2007, he stepped down shortly afterwards. Coupled with differing views among members about what the Quad would be meant the idea collectively died in 2008.

Conceptually, it was revived in 2012 when Japanese Prime Minister Abe -- back in office at that point -- wrote an article describing a ""strategy whereby Australia, India, Japan, and the US state of Hawaii form a diamond to safeguard the maritime commons stretching from the Indian Ocean region to the western Pacific."" Although the idea failed to gain traction, the combination of Chinese provocations against India and Australia and a US President more willing to push back against China served to resuscitate Abe's idea in 2017.

What tangibly, however, can or will the Quad do? In their Washington Post op-ed , the Quad leaders described the group as a flexible cluster of like-minded partners dedicated to advancing a common vision and to ensuring peace and prosperity. And in their joint statement , they committed themselves to promoting a free and open rules-based order, rooted in international law to advance security and prosperity and counter threats to both.

Statements such as these may sound impressive, but they fail to provide details on what the Quad is -- and is not -- capable of doing. In other words, what does the Quad look like in practice?

Consider first the military domain. It is not an alliance, nor is it likely to become one anytime soon. That makes arguments of the Quad becoming an Asian NATO not only premature, but downright foolish. However, it does have an explicit security component. What then will these four countries do to ""ensure"" peace if another country disrupts it?

It depends. Joint naval drills will not stop China, nor will they lead these four militaries to gain any operational interoperability that would be needed to fight effectively. And we should admit that none of these countries are ready to go to war for each other over China, with some exceptions of US treaty obligations. Would India, for example, come to Japan's aid if China invaded the Senkaku Islands? What about if China attacks India again at Galwan Valley, would Japan and Australia help? Would the United States help?

Rather than wartime support, the importance of the Quad in the security domain rests in what these members can do to shape the region in peacetime. The more Quad countries can cooperate in capacity building assistance to regional coast guards and navies or reinforce freedom of navigation through maritime patrols -- either individually or jointly -- the more these countries can tangibly support a free and open region. Importantly, and reflecting its origins, providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief through their militaries to regional countries could help ensure that states are not vulnerable for long periods of time in the wake of disasters.

These efforts will be supported by diplomatic activities. As a 2019 RAND Corporation report showed, US allies and partners are forming a set of important new links and security commitments across the region. If each Quad member is able to build upon existing relationships -- Japan with Southeast Asia; Australia with Pacific Islands; India with fellow South Asian nations; and the United States with select countries throughout the region -- toward shared ends, this could help reinforce the existing regional order, the diplomatic equivalent of ""force multipliers."" How they choose to engage and on what issues could matter considerably.

Take for example the Quad Vaccine Partnership pledge to cooperate on the manufacturing and distribution of up to 1 billion doses of safe, accessible, and effective vaccines to help end Covid-19 in the region. This not only delivers a public good, but it is also an activity that subtly takes aim at China's influence -- an effective counter to Beijing's ""vaccine diplomacy."" Mike Green, an expert in Asian policy, argues the move is likely to permanently reverse the vaccine diplomacy wars.

The same is true of partnering to address challenges presented by new technologies. China has set a goal for itself to be a leader in a number of emerging technologies by mid-century so that it can fight and win informatized warfare. The more that like-minded countries can cooperate, the better the chances that they may be able to achieve a technological edge against China and provide alternatives that prevent reliance on Chinese technology.

And yet, if public statements are to be believed, the Quad is supposed to be devoid of geopolitics and not about China. But the Quad is about China, at least in subtext. This is where the potential for friction arises. As former Defense Secretary James Mattis (and two other individuals) argued , the Quad will need a specific agenda that builds on shared goals. This sounds easy, but arguably could be the hardest part for the Quad.

What can Quad members do to check Chinese ambitions? What will the four countries do to ensure prosperity if the regional economies falter, and China employs economic coercion? How far are Quad members willing to go to push back against China?

One must remember what doomed the Quad in 2008 and later left the concept stagnant from 2012 until 2017: the fluidity of states' interests. Each state has its own complex relationship with China. Even though India and Australia saw a dramatic deterioration of ties with China in the past few years that helped align their countries with Japan and the United States, there is nothing to guarantee this trend will continue. And given India's history of non-alignment, its willingness to forge deeper ties with the United States likely will always be a source of uncertainty. The United States may even be susceptible to change if one considers the fluctuating policy approaches to China over the course of the past decade.

For the time being, the Quad has proven it can move beyond dialogue to tangible cooperation.

The real work begins now as the four countries work to develop a substantive agenda beyond Covid-19 vaccines. Discipline will also be required to deliver and maintain a coherent and unified message across the region as well.

If successful, their joint efforts could enhance their shaping activities and diplomatic outreach in ways none of the Quad members could do by themselves.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Opinion: All pregnant people deserve a law like New Zealand's,"Danielle Campoamor is a freelance editor and writer published in The New York Times, Washington Post, Vogue, Glamour and others. She received an award from Planned Parenthood for media excellence. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinions on CNN.

(CNN) Looking back, I cannot recall the exact time, or even the exact day, that I realized I was miscarrying my very-wanted pregnancy. All I remember is that I was at work, and politely excused myself to the bathroom to discover I was bleeding, which confirmed what the cramps and nausea were already telling me. I made an excuse to go home early and went straight to my OB-GYN, where she gave me an ultrasound, her condolences and sent me on my way.

Danielle Campoamor

I had just told my employer I was pregnant a few days, maybe a week, prior -- a decision some friends had argued against for the very reason I was now experiencing. It's hard enough telling your employer you're pregnant; telling them that you're not any more feels unimaginable.

I returned to my job the very next day, writing and editing stories about parenthood and newborns and healthy pregnancies as I bled into an oversized pad. I told myself I had been ""only"" 12 or so weeks pregnant, hardly a reason to make a ""big deal"" out of losing that pregnancy. I would soldier on, because I had to. Because what would it say to my employer or my colleagues about me if I couldn't?

It would have been so different for me -- as it would for so many others -- if employers (or better yet, governments) sent workers the message directly: We know this happens. We're here for you. You're entitled to take time to care for yourself and your family.

New Zealand recently became the first country to offer bereaved women paid time off after a miscarriage or infant loss . Employees will be entitled to three days' leave following a pregnancy under the law, which lawmakers unanimously approved and which is set to gain royal assent. This new measure immediately gained traction and started trending around the world. It's crucial to talk more about why.",2021-03-30 00:00:00
Opinion: Suez Canal traffic jam blocks the world's jugular vein,"Salvatore R. Mercogliano, Ph.D., is an associate professor of history at Campbell University, a former merchant mariner and contributor to gCaptain maritime. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) The Suez Canal made headlines on Wednesday. A 59-meter-(194-feet)-wide container ship called the Ever Given rammed into the eastern bank of the 120-mile-long Suez Canal. Traveling at a speed of 13 knots (15 mph), the 1,300 foot, 200,000-ton ultra large container ship came to a sudden stop with her bow aground in Asia and her stern at rest in Africa, creating a blockage in a waterway that sees 12% of the world commerce pass through it every year. As of Thursday, tugboats are still working to dislodge the Ever Given.

Sal Mercogliano

This is not a story you hear every day; maritime logistics do not cross most people's minds often, let alone wind up in the national news. But they are nonetheless pivotal to global trade. This story provides a stark reminder of the tenuous nature of our maritime global supply chain and the dangers to maritime choke points.

The closure of the Suez Canal has massive ramifications. Every day, 3.3 million tons of cargo traverse this waterway. On average, 50 ships arrive at the ports waiting to embark on their day-long passage. As Ever Given remains firmly across the canal, shipping companies will have to fathom the option of sending ships around Africa, adding as much as two weeks to their journey. All of this means a slow down in the delivery of goods, fuel and essential material between Asia and Europe. Factories depending on parts from Asia may have to close, and essential goods and products to battle Covid-19 may be inaccessible. Fuel prices, already high in Europe, could further increase

A failure of machinery, human error or natural events -- high winds and reduced visibility -- may have caused Ever Given to run ashore in the Suez Canal.

But its impact will resonate far from its banks as it has blocked the jugular of one of the largest trade routes in human history.",2021-03-25 00:00:00
Volcanologist: The big question about Iceland's 'cute' volcano (opinion),"Einat Lev, a volcanologist, is an associate research professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. Her research, funded by NASA and by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, is focused on lava flow dynamics at different volcanoes, including in Hawaii. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) The world is watching Fagradalsfjall volcano, in Iceland, which woke up this month after 700 years and is putting on a mesmerizing lava show . Volcanic eruptions are not often referred to as ""cute,"" but some people are saying that about Fagradalsfjall. They are calling it a Disneyland eruption.

But volcanoes are not amusement parks, and we still don't know how to predict where an awakening volcano will fit on the wide span between a thrilling spectacle and a deadly catastrophe.

Fagradalsfjall is no Eyjafjallajökull , and it's definitely not a Laki . For now, it's more like a Kilauea. But how long will this be true? How long will this ""cute"" show go on?

Fagradalsfjall's spring awakening has been a ""best-case scenario"" eruption in a country that gets a lot of eruptions. Iceland sits atop a plume rising from deep inside the earth to the shallow crust, where it meets the zigzag rift that separates the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates.

This geological hot spot gives Iceland its wondrously volatile landscape of hot springs, geysers, earthquakes and occasional major eruptions, like the spectacular 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, which disrupted European air traffic for weeks, and the 1783 eruptions at Laki, which released so much sulfur dioxide and other toxic gases over eight months that about 9,000 people in Iceland died -- about a quarter of the population. It changed the weather and caused more deaths across Europe.

JUST WATCHED See people roast hot dogs on this erupting volcano Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See people roast hot dogs on this erupting volcano 01:55

The eruption at Fagradalsfjall could have been one of those disastrous ones. Because of its location, scientists did not expect it to explode with tall ash plumes the way Eyjafjallajökull did. They predicted the fountaining and flowing of lava that we have been seeing. But how much lava? And how much toxic gas?

It's hard for scientists to say. There were tens of thousands of earthquakes, including some fairly large ones (~5 on the Richter scale), in just three weeks before Fagradalsfjall erupted. This heightened activity caught everyone's attention. Based on the early earthquakes, scientists mapped an intrusion of magma into a subsurface dike (a sheet of rock that can form in the fracture of older rocks) and forecasted that the eruption could take place at Mt. Keilier, at the northeastern tip of that dike.

Scientists were also watching the area from space, and with ground-based GPS trackers, to see how the earth was deforming and moving. They concluded that magna was accumulating under part of the Reykjanes Peninsula, in southwestern Iceland, and on March 11 reckoned, correctly, that the most likely place for an eruption was Fagradalsfjall.

So, the eruption's location and timing were predicted fairly accurately. But nobody knows now whether it will stop in a few days, or continue for years and become an unparalleled tourist attraction. Lava was oozing out of the Pu`u `O`o site on the flank of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii for 35 years. In 2018 it suddenly switched to a new site 14 miles away, where it destroyed hundreds of homes over an intense four-month stretch, before it abruptly stopped.

Then, too, we watched and watched. Which raises the question of why some eruptions receive a lot of press, while others do not.

On average, there are 20 active eruptions around the world at any given moment. Right now, there are 24. Some, for example, those in Kamchatka, Russia, are very remote and their main impact is on air travel from North America to Asia. Others, though, are having a significant effect on the life and livelihood of the communities nearby.

Merapi, in Indonesia, is continuously sending pyroclastic currents towards the communities on its flanks. Mt. Etna in Italy is currently very active, and village residents got coated in ash just last week. Just two weeks ago, significant ash also covered the residents of Guamote, a county seat 26 miles from Sangay volcano in Ecuador. Yet we barely hear about these.

The Fagradalsfjall eruption is very intriguing because it happened at a location that hadn't been active in hundreds of years. But Mt. Sinabung, in Indonesia, hadn't been active for a lot longer before its 2010 eruption, and it is still erupting to this day, sending currents of ash and hot debris towards communities. Did you know that? Is anyone, besides those who live close, watching, entranced?

There is one very important reason we are watching Iceland. As the seismic activity at Fagradalsfjall was ramping up, the Icelandic Met Office, as well as media outlets, placed webcams in the area likely to erupt. These have been streaming live video of the eruption site, serving fresh lava to the Instagram and TikTok generation.

Opnion: America's disastrous love affair with Rwanda's Paul Kagame,"Tom Zoellner is the co-author of Paul Rusesabagina's autobiography An Ordinary Man. Keir Pearson is the Oscar-nominated co-writer of the film ' Hotel Rwanda. ' The views expressed here are their own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Rwanda's journey from its 1994 genocide to a model of orderly developmen t made it a go-to country for those who want to invest in an African success story, taking in hundreds of millions in new overseas investments each year and making it one of corporate America's ideal places for charitable donations. But the love affair between the United States and Rwanda's hardline president Paul Kagame, should be seriously reconsidered after 27 years of systemic human rights abuses .

To name the alleged abuses is to name what's typical of despots everywhere: election-rigging, a captive judiciary, a well-oiled propaganda machine that silences truth, and the assassination of opposition leaders, journalists, and regime critics at home and abroad. The Rwandan government has consistently denied involvement in attacks against its critics, but after opposition figure Patrick Karegeya was killed in a South African hotel room in 2014, Kagame's Minister of Defense was quote d as saying, ""When you choose to be a dog, you die like a dog, and the cleaners will wipe away the trash so that it does not stink for them.""

Today Kagame is facing a fresh round of scrutiny over his latest transgression: the alleged kidnapping of Paul Rusesabagina, the protagonist from the film ' Hotel Rwanda, ' a US permanent resident and a widely-admired humanitarian figure. The Rwanda government has denied that he was kidnapped, but Rusesabagina described himself as a hostage when he appeared in a Kigali court last month on terrorism charges.

The charges are widely seen as trumped-up and the outcome of the trial should not be in doubt. Rwanda's justice system pivots on a single principle: the will of Kagame. This was underscored this month when Rusesabagina told the High Court that he will no longer attend his own trial because ""I don't expect any justice in this court."" He has good reason to believe so, saying he's been denied access to his own lawyers for months and after six months he still hasn't been allowed to examine the indictment and 5,000+ case files that detail the charges against him. The court's denial last week of motions brought by Rusesabagina and his attorneys has also denied him the right to cross-examine witnesses or review evidence.

JUST WATCHED CNN asks Rwandan president about trial of 'Hotel Rwanda' hero Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN asks Rwandan president about trial of 'Hotel Rwanda' hero 07:11

Kagame has long harbored animosity against Rusesabagina, who gained international fame and was awarded the US Medal of Freedom from George W. Bush in 2005 after the movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" depicted his acts of wily heroism in shielding 1,268 people within the Hotel des Mille Collines, a luxury hotel he managed in the heart of Rwanda's capital, during the genocide. Rusesabagina used his platform to make increasingly vociferous criticisms of Kagame's regime, a stance that turned him into an official pariah in his home country.

Kagame escalated a smear campaign against Rusesabagina, falsely claiming that he funded terrorists allied with a fringe group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The case went nowhere, a sign of its lack of credibility.

But dictators don't quit. A special chamber of Rwanda's High Court found this month that Rusesabagina was ""tricked"" when he boarded a private plane in Dubai last August.

In a set-up out of an espionage novel -- his family called it a kidnapping , which Kagame has disputed -- the chartered flight, supposedly headed to Burundi, landed in Kigali instead, where Rusesabagina was arrested. In our view, this was a gross violation of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

Kagame once again leveled ""terrorism"" charges against Rusesabagina laid out in an indictment that hangs on hearsay, inference, and witness testimony that is too easily coerced in Rwanda today. If this evidence was any good, it would have been submitted to Belgian and US authorities for extradition proceedings as Kagame has done in the past.

Those who have looked closely at Rusesabagina's plight have come to uniform conclusions. In December of last year, 37 members of the US Congress sent a letter to Kagame condemning the kidnapping and demanding Rusesabagina's release. On February 11, the European Union Parliament passed a resolution stating the same. But while Rusesabagina's unlawful detention may be on the radar of the Biden administration, the President made no public protest about it even after Rwanda's Justice Minister said in an Al Jazeera interview that his deputies confiscated Rusesabagina documents protected by attorney-client privilege, once again proving that the proceedings are a sham.

Given the fate of many political prisoners in Rwanda, Rusesabagina's chances of survival may be slim. ""You can't betray Rwanda and not get punished for it,"" Kagame is reported to have once chillingly told a prayer meeting. If the Biden administration wants to announce to the world that America's concern for human rights is back, a good place to start is by demanding the freedom of this global humanitarian figure. The US Agency for International Development last year announced a plan to give around $609 million to the country over the next five years. Curtailing this USAID money would be a powerful piece of leverage.

Rwanda became a model of post-genocide recovery because of its polished image, but the time has come to look under the dictatorial façade. Kagame has already made a clear point to anyone who challenges him: If I can do this to Paul Rusesabagina, just think what I can do to you.",2021-03-23 00:00:00
"To help Venezuelans, Biden can go beyond granting temporary immigration status","Amanda Mattingly is a Truman National Security Project fellow and a former foreign affairs officer at the US Department of State. She served at the US Embassy in Caracas in 2002-2003. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) The US government's decision to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Venezuelans is a welcome move, and it took President Joe Biden winning the White House to make it a reality. Broad US economic sanctions on Venezuela and former President Donald Trump's expansion of them, even as his administration declined to grant immigration status to Venezuelans who had fled their country, made an already devastating situation in Venezuela worse.

By extending TPS to Venezuelan nationals who have been in the US since at least March 8, the Biden administration gave them temporary legal status to live and work without fear of deportation. Given the extraordinary humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, this status should have been granted years ago -- and it may have been, if not for the harsh immigration policies of the Trump administration. As former US Ambassador to Venezuela Charles Shapiro told me, TPS was ""long overdue.""

According to the United Nations, 5.4 million Venezuelans have fled their country for political and economic reasons. Most have crossed borders to Colombia and Brazil, which are bearing the brunt of the mass exodus from Venezuela's collapse under dictator Nicolás Maduro, but many have come to the US as well.

Offering TPS to an estimated 300,000 eligible Venezuelans here is a significant humanitarian move by the US and also a significant delivery of a campaign promise Biden made

But we should not stop there. The political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, brought on by years of mismanagement and corruption under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez, warrants a robust response from the US. TPS should be just the first step in our efforts to help the Venezuelan people.

First and foremost, the Biden administration should focus on promoting democracy and reestablishing the US as a democratic leader in the region. Before the Trump administration, promoting and defending democracy were pillars of US foreign policy in Latin America and around the world. The January 6 US Capitol riot made this work harder for our diplomats, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has indicated , but getting back to our own democratic principles at home, including voting rights, will help us to regain a leadership role in promoting democratic principles and governance abroad.

Venezuela stands as a stark example of what happens to countries when democratically-elected leaders do not govern democratically, when democratic institutions are destroyed and when elections are no longer free or fair. The Venezuelan opposition has spent years fighting for free and fair elections, while the Venezuelan people have been forced to cross borders for food and medicine and out of a fear of political persecution.

The corruption and graft of the Maduro regime, supported by the Venezuelan military and security services, have made it nearly impossible to achieve political change in the country.

The Biden administration should start anew with allies in Latin America and Europe to work toward finding a peaceful, democratic solution to the political and economic crisis in Venezuela. Working through the Lima Group and the Organization of American States, the United States should lead in the efforts to bring about free and fair elections in Venezuela and a peaceful transfer of power.

Biden should also be prepared to roll back general oil sanctions on Venezuela if it means bringing Maduro to the negotiating table to hammer out a deal to allow free and fair elections to be held.

So far, those general sanctions have harmed the Venezuelan people, not just the country's leaders, and have failed to meet their objective of ousting Maduro. The US placed sanctions on the Venezuelan oil sector in January 2019 , when opposition leader Juan Guaidó was ascendent and the Trump team believed Maduro would be overthrown quickly. But that did not happen.

Yes, the crisis in Venezuela began long before US oil sanctions were put in place, but they have not helped the situation. Instead, sanctions on Venezuela should be targeted and specific, focused on individuals and entities close to and funding Maduro. This includes Venezuelans in the military, the security forces protecting Maduro, and state-owned enterprises that profit off of Maduro's corruption at the expense of the Venezuelan people. Venezuelans undermining democratic institutions, or who are associated with alleged human-rights abuses, should also face sanctions.

Defending human rights in Venezuela should be a top priority for the Biden administration as well. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the United Nations have all alleged abuses by the Maduro regime. Although the Venezuelan government has denied these reports, defending democracy means defending human rights and the US should do its part to hold Maduro to account.

Venezuela's crisis is not going to be resolved overnight. With 96% of Venezuelan households living in poverty today, it will take generations to reverse the degradation.",2021-03-21 00:00:00
Opinion: How to solve the mystery around Covid-19's origin,"Matthew M. Kavanagh is director of the global health policy and politics initiative at Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, assistant professor of international health, and visiting professor of law. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Even before a report on the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak was released Tuesday, some were faulting the World Health Organization for not securing more conclusive information and cooperation from China. But if the US and Europe want more, they need to engage in smarter global health diplomacy than they have so far.

The report, released by a panel of individual scientists tasked by the WHO to research the origins of the pandemic, suggests the SARS-CoV-2 virus very likely jumped from animals to humans, possibly linked to wildlife farms where it may have moved from bats to an intermediate species before infecting humans.

The report found that neither the Chinese claims that the virus was imported via frozen food nor Trump administration claims that it escaped from a laboratory are likely, but investigators did not have enough information to fully eliminate either theory.

This research has not settled the debate over the origin of the outbreak. But we should not be surprised. In the best-case scenario, researching the origin of outbreaks can take years. This is not the best case. During this pandemic, international cooperation has been undermined by US, European, and Chinese actions. It is clear from the what information is and is not in the report that Chinese officials have not yet shared enough data or allowed adequate research for firm conclusions -- and the WHO has few tools to compel greater transparency.

Without more support, saddling the WHO with this technically difficult and politically fraught task could hamstring the organization during an ongoing pandemic. If we want independent investigations of outbreaks, the WHO or another entity needs to be given additional powers, and until then it is really up to powerful states to push China. But governments should not lose the opportunity to strengthen global health in the search for this virus's origin.

Critics, including former Trump-administration officials, accuse the WHO of giving China too much influence over in the investigation. They suggest the WHO should do more to investigate Chinese labs and markets.

These criticisms, however, reflect a misunderstanding of the agency's role and chronic tendency of member countries and political pundits to blame the organization for not doing things its member states have not empowered it to do. The WHO plays an indispensable, if imperfect, role addressing everything from AIDS, Ebola, and Covid-19 to chronic diseases. Weakening it helps no one, but that is a foreseeable result of putting an international organization in the middle of a conflict between major powers over how the pandemic started without the tools to resolve the issue.

Produced by a team of individual experts, half Chinese and half international, the report does not reflect the investigation or the conclusions of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who upon receiving the report called for ""future collaborative studies to include more timely and comprehensive data sharing.""

In fact, member states have not given the WHO authority to conduct more independent investigations, unlike powers given to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) , for example. There is no secret WHO intelligence-gathering force and, under international law, no threat of sanctions if China does not comply with WHO's requests for information or access. The International Health Regulations, despite a lofty name and binding international legal status, give the WHO few powers in collecting and reporting data against the wishes of member states. The agency can privately use diplomacy with governments or critique countries publicly -- but these only go so far.

Investigating how this pandemic began was always going to be difficult. No country likes outside prying. Imagine US politicians' reaction to an international investigation of Covid-19 outbreaks connected to spring breakers in Miami. There are far higher stakes for China, a rising authoritarian power where information is tightly restricted and the government is working hard to avoid reputational damage from this pandemic. The Chinese government controlled the itinerary of the scientific team who, according to the WHO, also reported difficulties in gaining access raw data on thousands of patients.This lack of transparency does not, of course, prove a cover-up, but neither does it convince the world China has nothing to hide.

European countries, wary of confronting China and weary of US actions, had little stomach for hardball diplomacy with China on this origins study -- not while the US was attacking the WHO and China was retaliating against Australia for calling for an independent investigation of the outbreak's origin.

WHO officials, in hindsight, might have acted more tactically vis-a-vis China. The WHO's Executive Board, for example, might have been used as a forum to push China to commit to greater access at the outset.

Ultimately, though, the US and other major powers cannot outsource China diplomacy on this issue to the WHO. The organization has gotten more from China than anyone else, including epidemiology data collected early in the outbreak that confirms that the virus emerged in the fall of 2019. But greater access to raw data and potentially sensitive interviews with Chinese personnel are unlikely without the type of strategic diplomacy only nation states can take on.

Rather than further weakening the WHO, the US should build it up. The Biden-Harris administration has re-engaged with the organization and could increase funding and political support. The US could back giving the organization investigative powers or, perhaps better, a new body could be given that task to avoid confusing the WHO's mission. Strengthening the WHO's capacity for proactive detection of emerging viruses could lessen the need to chase the origins of the next pandemic. Cooperating to build future-focused global health systems may be a more fruitful engagement with China than is likely to come investigating this pandemic.

We may not know the true origin of this virus for years, if ever. But, nonetheless, we need a stronger, more capable WHO, focused on responding to this pandemic and preventing the next one, not a WHO immobilized by conflict between major powers.",2021-04-01 00:00:00
Opinion: Putin and Biden are already locked in a war of words,"Daniel Treisman is a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, the author of ""The Return: Russia's Journey from Gorbachev to Medvedev"" and editor of "" The New Autocracy: Information, Politics, and Policy in Putin's Russia ."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

On Wednesday, in an interview with ABC News, President Biden agreed with his host, George Stephanopoulos, that Russian President Vladimir Putin was a "" killer ."" He was speaking after the Director of National Intelligence released a report accusing Russia's intelligence services of interfering in the 2020 US presidential election in an attempt to sow divisions and get President Trump reelected. ""He will pay a price,"" Biden said of Putin.

The Kremlin quickly struck back, recalling its ambassador from Washington for consultations in a rare show of diplomatic pique. On Russian TV on Thursday, Putin responded with a touch of verbal judo, suggesting that Biden had really been describing himself: ""We always see our own qualities in another person and think that they are like us .""

""Be healthy,"" Putin told the US president, emphasizing the words, ""I wish you health."" It was an interesting choice of phrase for a leader accused of having his enemies poisoned.

Later, Putin challenged Biden to some kind of Internet duel . He was ready to meet, he said, for a live, online discussion about world politics. He seemed to think he could best the man his admirer Donald Trump named ""Sleepy Joe"" in a broadcast debate.

All this suggests the depths to which US-Russia relations have sunk.

Insulting foreign leaders is not unprecedented in US politics. President George W. Bush dubbed Iran's leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a "" tyrant ,"" and North Korea's Kim Jong-il a "" pygmy ."" His father, George H.W. Bush, called Panama's President Noriega an "" outlaw in the world community .""

While most presidents go easy on the trash talk, tongues in Congress are less restrained. Senator John McCain made a habit of goading the Kremlin. Putin, McCain said, was a ""thug and a murderer and a killer and a KGB agent .""

This new diplomacy of insults marks quite a change from the flattery with which Biden's predecessor targeted the world's authoritarians, including Putin. Foreign strongmen were virtually the only group that Trump did not regularly abuse.

The question is whether it will work -- and, if so, for whom. Putin quickly turned Biden's comment to his own propaganda purposes. Interrupting a celebration of the 7th anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea, he launched into a well-rehearsed lecture on the historic brutality of US leaders -- from the extermination of Native Americans, via Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to Black Lives Matter, the name of which he pronounced in passable English. ""Still today,"" he insisted, ""African Americans are subject to injustice and extermination.""

No wonder, Putin seemed to be saying, that US presidents see ""killers"" all around them.

His quick pivot to the online talks idea suggests he also saw in this an international opening. Putin named a number of issues he and Biden could discuss -- from the nuclear balance to regional conflicts.

What he's up to is not entirely clear. He might just hope to score debating points before a global audience. But it's also possible he thinks he can jolt the relationship out of the deadlock that has prevailed since Crimea.

Although not imminently threatened, Putin knows things at home do not look good. The post-Crimea euphoria is long gone. Putin's approval rating , after crashing at the onset of the coronavirus crisis, remains around 65%. That might sound high, but in a country with heavily restricted media and politics, it's not so reassuring.

Heading into a parliamentary election this September, only 42% of those who plan to vote favor the Kremlin's United Russia party-- its lowest support level since at least 2016.

Russia's economy, as measured by its GDP, shrank by 3.1% last year. It could have been worse. Skilled macroeconomic management -- with a flexible exchange rate and inflation targeting -- kept the decline moderate and inflation low, but at the cost of lower social spending and inadequate healthcare funding.

And, as Putin certainly realizes, the Kremlin has an image problem. In January, the opposition leader Aleksei Navalny -- now jailed-- released a video showing a palatial estate allegedly owned by Putin. (The Russian president denies owning it.) It has been viewed almost 115 million times . Record numbers of Russians say in polls that corruption is the country's greatest problem.

A major improvement in relations with Washington is not in the cards. Convinced that the US is out to undermine him, Putin see his best defense as an attack. He will not stop cyber operations to spy, infiltrate Western infrastructure, and influence elections. The West does all these things to him, he believes, so why disarm?

In response to such interference, Washington feels obliged to continue piling on sanctions. But few think the kind of targeted asset freezes and travel bans favored recently will change Kremlin behavior. And major, economy-wide sanctions -- such as cutting off access to dollar-based international finance -- would probably backfire, antagonizing ordinary Russians, while harming US allies and threatening its status as the world's financial superpower.

Washington's best bet is to build a global coalition to resist Moscow, while working to show the Russian public how its interests diverge from those of Kremlin insiders. Yet, the kind of insult diplomacy seen in recent days makes that harder. It alienates European and other allies, who see in name-calling a lack of seriousness. And it rallies the Russian public behind their leaders.

True, Ronald Reagan started out calling the Soviet Union an ""evil empire"" and ended up negotiating an end to the Cold War with his Russian counterpart. The rhetoric early on did not preclude pragmatism later. Perhaps Biden intends by talking tough to prepare the ground for bargaining.

(CNN) As the Biden administration weighs whether to remove all US troops from Afghanistan by May 1 — upholding the Trump administration's agreement with the Taliban — its discussions should focus on one main concern: preventing future terrorist attacks on the United States or its allies from Afghan territory. Since 9/11, this objective has guided US engagement across four presidencies.

Those who argue that we need to stay in Afghanistan to thwart attacks against the homeland are wrong. Biden should keep in mind the obvious: 2021 is not 2001. The terrorist threat from Afghanistan has been dramatically reduced in the last 20 years. The departure of US troops is not only possible, but desirable.

The United States and its coalition partners have devastated al Qaeda and crippled its ability to strike across borders. The terrorist group has not been able to carry out a major overseas attack since the bombings in London in 2005. Its leaders have been in hiding for years, although mostly not in Afghanistan, as became clear in the 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed Osama Bin Laden. The Taliban does maintain links to al Qaeda, including through family ties . Yet the several hundred remaining al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and Pakistan pose a minor threat, especially compared with the group's more dangerous branches in Yemen, Somalia, Syria and the Sahel.

The same goes for the Afghanistan branch of the Islamic State, which has shown no ability to carry out transnational attacks and is under constant military pressure from the Afghan state and the Taliban.

Terrorist groups like al Qaeda can regenerate, of course, but rebuilding in Afghanistan would be difficult, even if the Taliban becomes part of a future government. Since 2001, the United States and its international partners have made slow but substantial progress in developing Afghan institutions, including domestic security forces comprising more than 300,000 members of the army and police.

(CNN) Last week, many conservative pundits spent time focused on two incidents that they argue exposed President Joe Biden's shortcomings. The first was his tripping and falling while on the stairs leading up to Air Force One and the second was his use of extensive notes (which some analysts referred to as a script) during the first press conference of his presidency.

The clips of Biden's apparent ineptitude went viral on some social media sites and, by the end of the week, they were covered extensively on conservative talk radio and some television networks as well.

This week's controversy was over whether Biden should have more control over his own dogs, one of whom reportedly defecated on the floor of the White House and, for the second time, bit a federal employee.

Some of these critiques are undoubtedly an outgrowth of how many progressive media figures covered the Trump presidency, where the former president's physical slip-ups and gaffes were the subject of breathless coverage. But conservatives should be wary of following suit. When they focus too much on Biden's stylistic shortcomings, it's easy to lose the forest for the trees.

The more important critique is the one that should be leveled at the substance of Biden's presidency -- the massive policy changes that he has already overseen and is proposing in the months and years to come. Republicans in Congress and across the country should be focusing their fire on Biden's policies and, even more importantly, presenting their own plans for solving some of the problems he proposes to address.",2021-04-01 00:00:00
The first Korean American first lady in the US: We will not stand silent any more (Opinion),"Yumi Hogan is first lady of Maryland, and the first Korean American first lady in the United States. Mrs. Hogan is a first-generation Korean American, an accomplished artist, and an adjunct professor at Maryland Institute College of Art. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Forty one years. That's how long I have lived in the United States since emigrating from South Korea to pursue the American dream.

Twenty years. That's how long I spent working multiple jobs, often 14 or 16 hours a day, to raise three daughters as a single mother, all so they could have access to the countless opportunities this country has to offer.

I grew up on a chicken farm in a small town in South Korea as the youngest of eight kids. I was born nine years after the Korean War broke out. Most Koreans were poor . My family worked hard, and I was taught to be sober and diligent -- to never get lazy. Leftover and broken eggs that couldn't be sold from the farm were my snack. I walked 2 miles every day between home and school since there was no bus available.

At 20, I already had a ""hard working gene"" by the time I arrived to the US. I was humble and determined. That's how I was taught. But the reality here was tough: I didn't speak much English, and I was in a completely different world culturally.

Moreover, as a single mother with three daughters, I didn't have time to do anything for myself. I couldn't take any sick days because I worked every day to feed my daughters, send them to school, and pay the bills. My life didn't seem to be close to the American Dream. Without letting my daughters know, I would dry my tears quietly, remembering my childhood. I missed everything familiar from my homeland.

But I never, never gave up.

My family came first. I did everything to provide a better life and education for my daughters. Once my two oldest daughters grew up, they helped me a lot and took part-time jobs. They worked and studied hard. They were the reason I went through all the hard times, and ultimately were the ones who helped me push through.

Once their dreams had come true, they said, ""It's your turn, mom. You sacrificed everything for us. Now follow your own passion and dream."" They told me that otherwise our American Dream was not complete. After I married my husband, he encouraged me as well. He was an inspiration to me.

Finally, I decided to do something for myself. Thanks to my husband and daughters, I went back to school and studied with students who were the same age as my youngest daughter. But I finished my degree at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) and received a Master of Fine Arts at American University. Years later, my big dream came true -- teaching at MICA, where I've worked for the last 10 years.

That's my story. It's an American story -- and it's the story of so many of my fellow Asian Americans.

From coast to coast, we have worked hard, served our communities, started businesses, and raised families here, often while struggling to learn a new culture and a new language. As a result, we have become an indispensable part of this country. We contributed to building America.

However, there is something that has not changed.

We, Asian Americans, still face discrimination and racism.

Many Asian Americans and most first-generation immigrants have experienced it at least a couple of times. Some may share common experiences -- no support or response was provided by the police when hate crimes or incidents happened; their windows were broken by aggressors; discrimination or bamboo-ceilings prevented them from being promoted at work; they were asked where they ""originally"" or ""really"" come from; their children were bullied and told they ""smell bad"" due to their lunch box with Asian food; they were insulted with slanted-eye gestures.

We Asian Americans are a proud people. Instead of fighting back or speaking up against this hate, we worked that much harder to prove our worth. We focused on the problems right in front of us -- finding ways to make ends meet, feed our families, and educate our children.

But now, as our nation grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, hurtful words have too often escalated to brutal acts of violence.

As the first Korean American first lady in the history of the United States, Maryland's first Asian American first lady, and a first-generation immigrant, my heart breaks for all victims of hate and racism. Today, our grandparents, parents, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, and friends are forced to live in fear. But as proud citizens of this country, we should not have to be afraid of anything.

The time has come for us to speak out, and demand action.

Last week, I stood alongside my husband and fellow community leaders to lift up the forgotten voice of Asian Americans. After all, every one of us is in some way an immigrant to this land. No one should hear, ""go back"" to somewhere -- this is our home.

We are calling on leaders in Washington, DC, to take this matter seriously by passing laws, like those we have in Maryland , that improve and expand the reporting of hate crimes. In 2019, my husband signed legislation to expand the categories of hate crimes that law enforcement must collect, analyze and report information on, as well as new penalties for those who threaten to commit a hate crime. He has also directed state law enforcement officials to institute enhanced visibility patrols to protect Asian businesses and communities and is calling on every level of government to vigorously investigate all hate crimes allegations.

But institutions and laws are not enough. Asian Americans are both explicitly and implicitly discriminated against. Some who ask us, ""Where are you from?"" do so genuinely, but ultimately alienate and label us without evil intentions. Regardless, we are judged on whether we are American enough all the time. Our society should evolve to the point where Asian Americans are considered Americans without any questions.

This country is the envy of the world because of its diversity. That diversity makes us stronger, and it is built on embracing, understanding, and enjoying the differences among us.

My fellow Asian Americans weep over the rising number of attacks against our people. But in the face of this senseless violence, I see a new strength, determination and resilience in our eyes.

We will not stay silent anymore. But we will also not respond with vengeance. Instead, we will love each other more, we will support each other more, and we will stand together. We will make sure the overwhelming outpouring of support from leaders turns into real and lasting action that protects our children and grandchildren.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
How America's all-volunteer force reshaped the military -- and the country (Opinion),"James E. Wright, President Emeritus of Dartmouth College, enlisted in the Marines in 1957 at 17. A historian, he is the author most recently of ""Enduring Vietnam: An American Generation and Its War."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Over the last year, the pandemic -- with all its human tragedies and socioeconomic consequences, as well as the November election and its contested and violent aftermath -- has dominated the nation's attention.

But there were two events in 2020 that deserved more discussion. First, the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service, established by Congress in 2016, issued a significant report on March 25 urging a renewed emphasis on a culture of service. And 2020 marked the year when men born in 1955 became eligible for Social Security. Those men were the last Americans eligible to be drafted into military service. Now, no American under 65 has faced a draft notice.

The All-Volunteer Force was implemented in 1973. During the 20 years of war in the Middle East, few of us have known those who have served there. Moreover, these have been the first extended wars in our history without a dedicated tax to pay for them. Most citizens have only a passing understanding of, or interest in, these military operations.

The All-Volunteer Force was recommended in 1970 by a commission chaired by former Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates, and members included economist Milton Friedman, Notre Dame President Father Theodore Hesburgh, and NAACP Director Roy Wilkins. Their recommendations had broad support by groups ranging from anti-war and anti-draft demonstrators to libertarians to senior military leaders, and they were approved by liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike -- as well as by President Richard Nixon. All were seeking to distance themselves from the draft controversies of the Vietnam War.

In this century, these volunteers have served in the most professional, highly educated, and diverse military this country has known. They have conducted themselves well -- with multiple deployments under trying circumstances in wars without end. They deserve the thanks of the nation.

A smaller volunteer force has consequences. In the over-75 age group , 44% of the men and 1% of the women are veterans. In the under-34 age group , among men it is 3% and women less than 1%. The military today is represented by enlistees from rural areas more than urban, and the South and the West more than the rest of the country. Over 40% of enlistees are Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Sixteen percent are women . Many enlistees come from a military family.

A disproportionate number of those arrested following the January 6 attack on the Capitol were veterans. This should be troubling. There are a few factors that might partially explain this: The 21st Century military has been more successfully recruited from rural areas, as well as in the South and Southwest -- notably ""red state"" areas.

Politically, veterans have tended to be more Conservative, and they were more supportive of President Donald Trump -- although that support has declined in the last four years. Enlistment processes have not screened for racists; and military commands often have ignored white supremacist and neo-Nazi views among those in their ranks. Extremist groups, especially the para-military organizations. have explicitly sought to recruit military veterans. The consequences of these circumstances were visible on January 6. A CNN analysis shortly after the riot found that 14% of those charged with criminal conduct were veterans.

What needs to be equally apparent is that many of the voices who have spoken out against the January 6 assault on democracy were also veterans. A study in 2012 indicated that the Capitol Police Force had over 20% veterans. Brian Sicknick, the police officer killed in the attack, was a veteran.

The problem with the Republic today is not a problem with military veterans. To be sure, some veterans, along with many non-veterans, joined in actions contrary to our democratic values. They must be held accountable. But there has been something more fundamental at work in this country in the last 50 years: a decline in civic culture, an erosion of trust in government, in its representatives, its democratic processes, and a contagion of conspiracy theories.

Those born in 1955 heard it later when President John F. Kennedy insisted , ""Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country."" They watched siblings and friends enlist in the military or the Peace Corps. Despite the controversy over the draft, nearly 80% of those who served in the military during the Vietnam era were enlistees. Children of the WW II generation, they grew up in a culture that emphasized service.

This culture was not sustained. In the last half century, this nation has watched the release of the Pentagon Papers and the revelations of Watergate, detailing deceit at the highest levels of government. President Ronald Reagan argued that government is not the solution but the problem. This attitude has evolved from a campaign slogan to a conviction that the government cannot be trusted -- that career public servants are deep-state swamp dwellers.

Many politicians and political commentators today reject bipartisan statesmanship. They shout that politics is about tribal loyalty and call opponents untrustworthy and disloyal. Expressions of racism and intolerance of ""others"" have become too common. Political leaders have refused to accept the results of a democratic election. Fringe views have become mainstream, and cynicism, hatred, and fear are stoked on cable television and social media. Schools are far less likely to require basic civics courses.

If veterans were represented disproportionately among those arrested for invading the Capitol on January 6, I would observe they were far from proportionately represented among those Republican leaders and media personalities who lied to them and encouraged them. Although it is the case that of the 53 veterans serving as Republican members of Congress, 35 of them voted to reject the certified Arizona electoral votes.

The importance of dedicated service and sacrifice has been celebrated during the Covid-19 crisis. We need to build on the example of those who cared for us. The National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service urged an effort to build upon this, to affirm a ""widespread culture of service....""

Starting with our leaders and representatives, all Americans need to acknowledge that our republic depends upon mutual trust, volunteerism and civic values. People who insist they are ""patriots"" should start acting like it. The vast majority of our veterans already have.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Opinion: Biden's new plan is an unfocused spending spree,"Carrie Sheffield is a senior fellow at Independent Women's Forum. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) On Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced his massive infrastructure plan -- his latest effort to expand government influence over our economy, laying out a two-part spending spree that will grow our national debt, make us less competitive with other countries and likely lead to job losses among working-class Americans.

Carrie Sheffield

It's hard to see how this plan, being marketed as the American Jobs Plan, helps an economy that is continuing to climb out of a Covid-induced hole, especially when it comes less than a month after Congress passed a $1.9 trillion spending bill that was not nearly as narrowly tailored as it should have been to help those most in need: the unemployed and those whose wages had been cut back. And this is particularly striking because there is little evidence to suggest that past Covid bills worked efficiently, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimating that just 60% of last year's $1,200 stimulus checks would generate economic activity . Meanwhile, a study on the spring 2020 stimulus by the National Bureau of Economics found more than 80% of stimulus beneficiaries either saved the money or used it to pay down debt -- ""with only about 15 percent reporting that they mostly spent it.""

Saving money and paying down debt are worthy pursuits, but they don't boost economic growth. It's better for Americans to earn more money in jobs today rather than living off future generations. From what we know of the new Biden plan so far, it appears a free-for-all grab bag of spending projects, far from serving those most severely hit by the pandemic.",2021-03-31 00:00:00

(CNN) President Joe Biden has delivered on his promise to follow his Covid relief bill with a long-term recovery plan. His new American Jobs Plan is a comprehensive, well-targeted and timely approach to America's many long-term economic ills, responding powerfully to 40 years of federal neglect.

Jeffrey Sachs

Many conservatives will object, but their relentless naysaying has been the primary reason for America's growing crises of inequality, precarious work and environmental disasters.

Biden's plan is built around the idea of sustainable development: an economy that is prosperous, fair and environmentally conscious. It does so by funding upgrades to education, advances in digital technology, renewable energy and our transportation infrastructure. And the plan goes back to the basics -- echoing the boldness of past federal projects as varied as the Tennessee Valley Authority , the federal interstate highway system and the creation of the internet.

The breadth of the Biden infrastructure program is impressive and well designed , including electrified transport, safe drinking water and high-speed broadband for all Americans. These investments are combined with modernizing homes, commercial buildings, schools, hospitals and federal buildings.

The Path to Recovery The Path to Recovery, a new CNN Opinion series, aims to help readers understand an economic crisis that has been building for decades and the role that the federal government should play in solving it.

The plan includes two additional pillars: research and development funding to put the US back in the lead on cutting-edge green and digital technologies; and a nationwide industrial policy to ensure that all parts of the nation share in the green and digital boom. In short, this is a jobs program for all regions, not just for today's high-tech coasts.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Opinion: The roadmap for Biden's infrastructure plan goes back to 1956,"While the scope and scale of the Biden plan may be unprecedented, the two-pronged infrastructure proposal is only the latest chapter in a long history of federal efforts to bind together the nation that began with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, popularly known as the National Interstate and Defense Highway Act, or simply the Eisenhower Interstate System.

For Biden to accomplish his own infrastructure goals, he should draw on the lessons from the passage and implementation of this system. Like Eisenhower, Biden will need to find a legislative path that satisfies Democrats -- and potentially Republicans in Congress -- and garners the widespread support of the American people. To improve the nation's infrastructure for good, he must similarly build a system that will last beyond his time in office.

Infrastructural challenges have long occupied the thoughts of political leaders. As early as the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the need to build an interstate system. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 authorized the construction of a 40,000-mile ""National System of Interstate Highways."" Yet the demands of World War II delayed the implementation of the plan, even as routes were laid out for the future highways.

The 1952 election of Dwight D. Eisenhower as president set the stage for a major change. As a young army officer, Eisenhower had experienced first-hand the difficulty in transporting convoys of vehicles across the country. During World War II, as Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, he noted how Nazi forces could move quickly across Germany using the system of autobahns. ""The old convoy had started me thinking about good, two-lane highways,"" he recalled in his 1967 memoir, ""but Germany had made me see the wisdom of broader ribbons across the land.""

The political climate of the Cold War of the mid-1950s also brought a new will to act. In 1954, Eisenhower appointed General Lucius D. Clay -- Eisenhower's deputy during World War Two -- to form a committee to consider how best to fund an interstate highway system. The committee's report and the resulting bill contained a key phrase, notably that a highway system was ""essential to the national interest.""

Nevertheless, Congress debated how to fund the proposed improvements, which were estimated to cost $27 billion. Fiscally conservative Democrats in Congress opposed using public bonds to finance the system. The eventual solution was to indirectly tax the users of the highways through a federal surcharge on gasoline set at 3 cents per gallon and soon increased to 4.5 cents per gallon. From there, excise taxes on highway-related industries such as tire rubber and auto sales further supported the interstate system. A Highway Trust Fund -- based off the Social Security Trust Fund established in the 1930s -- safeguarded the taxes collected.

Lawmakers also underscored that such national interest also included a commitment to ""national defense."" The interstates could be used to transport military convoys across the nation, though contrary to popular opinion, they were not intended as runways to land military-grade aircraft.

Along the way, Eisenhower withstood lobbying efforts to eliminate the gas tax, thus preserving the key means to ensuring the system's solvency. Although still recovering from surgery at Walter Reed Hospital, he signed the bill into law on June 29, 1956.

Future presidents continued the work begun under Eisenhower and confronted challenges of funding the system. Facing the expiration of a temporary increase on the gas tax, John F. Kennedy recommended making the raise permanent and added other excise taxes. In turn, Congress passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1961 that provided for the interstate system for years to come. In 1966, Lyndon Johnson signed the U.S. Department of Transportation Act to create an agency to oversee government spending on infrastructure.

The economic and social benefits of the highway system have reverberated across the generations. A report from 1996 pointed to a return in economic productivity of more than six times the original amount spent, enhanced international security, and greater personal mobility for Americans. With interstate highways suddenly available, the great American road trip was born.

The Biden infrastructure plan features many items we have come to expect. The bill will support upgrading roads, bridges, and airports. In addition, money will be poured into schools and will upgrade the nation's broadband and energy infrastructure. However, Biden's plan calls for a second, more controversial package to support ""social infrastructure,"" or the ""care economy."" This second bill includes funding for universal pre-K, childcare programs, elder care, and free community college among other provisions.

Whereas the National Interstate and Defense Highway Act enjoyed near-unanimous bipartisan support, the political fate of Biden's infrastructure bill is less clear. In the face of Republican opposition, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has lobbied the Senate parliamentarian to permit the use of budget reconciliation -- used to pass the Covid relief bill without the need for any Republican votes -- for an unprecedented second time in one fiscal year. Such a move may well be necessary if existing Senate rules on the filibuster are preserved.

Whatever this infrastructure bill's final form, the battles over highways in the 1950s reveal the critical importance of presidential leadership. Without Eisenhower's support, the interstate highway system would not exist in its present form. But the support of future administrations -- both Democratic and Republican -- ensured the long-term viability of the interstate system long after Eisenhower had left office.

During the 2020 election campaign, Joe Biden campaigned to ""Build Back Better,"" with his infrastructure plan lying at the heart of this promise. As it has been in the past, the road ahead will almost certainly be rocky. But if Biden can achieve his goals of funding the nation's physical infrastructure and social infrastructure, he will have laid the groundwork for a lasting system worthy of his name.",2021-03-30 00:00:00
Opinion: The hard lesson of Dr. Deborah Birx,"(CNN) Think back to March 2020. The novel coronavirus pandemic had just been declared a pandemic, and the federal response was already being botched. With the White House alternating between chaos and denial, the nation was looking to two physicians, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci, for guidance. They were teammates in shaping our country's response to the novel coronavirus. Although neither was seen as perfect , we were all hopeful.

How times have changed. Over the last year Fauci has received widespread and well-deserved acclaim, while Birx's previously sterling reputation has been tarnished -- perhaps irrevocably.

As a clinician-scientist (and public health professional), I have criticized Birx . But I also have to wonder: What went wrong?

Before Covid-19, Birx was known as a consummate scientist and public health professional. In her leadership of international HIV/AIDS programs, she was praised for her ability to cross the partisan divide to mobilize resources for good science. We all took a sigh of relief when she was named as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator in late February 2020, expecting her to continue her role as a voice of reason during the pandemic.

Accepting a job working for Donald Trump was her first and worst mistake.

She, like many of us, had no idea how badly his administration would distort, ignore and deny science and the truth during the pandemic. Although she said she took the job out of a sense of obligation (""That's what a civil servant is supposed to do,"" she said a year later), Birx became inextricably tied to the harmful decisions of her negligent, disastrously ignorant boss.

In a new CNN documentary airing Sunday, Birx revealed what she believed to be the extent of the Trump administration's failures when she told Dr. Sanjay Gupta that she thought the vast majority of the US' Covid-19 deaths could have been prevented. ""There were about a hundred thousand deaths that came from that original surge. All of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially,"" she said

Fauci's position at the National Institutes of Health allowed him some degree of political independence from Trump. Birx did not have that luxury. The first lesson is: Know whom you are agreeing to work for.

Birx's next error was allowing the regime's lies to go unchecked. It's true that she said many things right, from her first day to her last. And as a White House team member, she would have found it hard to publicly contradict her boss. And it's understandable that she thought she would do more good from inside the administration instead of as an outside observer. She said this herself in January. But still -- she could have drawn the lines of honesty and integrity much earlier.

It wasn't until late summer 2020 that she went out on the road to personally meet with, and guide, public health professionals. This was, frankly, too little, too late, and with too little power or publicity behind it. Not until October did we learn that she had refused to be in the same room as Trump's Covid adviser, the neuroradiologist Dr. Scott Atlas, who was one of the most harmful people in our country's federal coronavirus response.

For months as the calamity worsened, she let Trump's lies go unchecked on the public stage. The harm was irrevocable.

The second lesson: Don't hesitate to blow the whistle. Don't keep quiet when something is really wrong. The AIDS activists were right decades ago: Silence = death.

Birx's mistakes were complicated by something that wasn't her fault at all, and something I know all too well: She was a woman in a male-centered world. We know that the Trump White House had a reputation for being particularly toxic for women. As a female physician-scientist myself, I am familiar with implicit and explicit misogyny and the big and small ways in which it changes one's decisions.

Birx has confronted these trends throughout her life, and doubtless developed a thick skin -- and a tolerance for small insults -- in order to get to this place. But that accommodation may also have been part of her downfall; like many of us she might have gotten so used to accepting the small slights that she may not have seen the bigger warning signs until she was in too deep.

So I take her story as a warning, particularly for women and minorities: Sometimes our methods of survival can turn into weaknesses.

At the end of the day, I am sad for Birx. She was an amazing leader for most of her career. And she seems to have done her best to make up for the administration's malfeasance. I have no doubt that she is a good person. But her months of public silence caused us all harm.

So my final lesson and biggest lesson from this case study: Our integrity is our biggest asset. Don't give it up easily. And make sure you surround yourself with people who will serve as an early warning bell when your reputation is in danger of being broken.",2021-03-28 00:00:00
Opinion: The reason we can't fully explore space is fixable. Here's how,"With so many challenges facing us here on Earth — the pandemic, climate change, the economy — it might seem like an odd time to focus on space.

But space exploration offers enormous benefits for all of us. There's a long list of innovations that have emerged as a result of space research that have already spawned entire industries: the Global Positioning System, phone cameras, portable computers, water-purification systems, cochlear implants, artificial limbs, wireless headphones, CAT scans, LASIK and even the dustbuster handheld vacuum.

And many of us are able to live and thrive partly because satellites help farmers assess climate and growing conditions and decide which areas are best for cultivation, while also alerting them to unfavorable weather conditions or predictions of longer-term drought. Looking ahead, space commercialization — asteroid mining, manufacturing and scientific research — will require vast amounts of capital and the hiring of skilled labor, creating both wealth and jobs.

When the US government ended the Space Shuttle program in 2011 , it created a huge opportunity for space entrepreneurs. Private companies — like mine and those headed by wealthy investors Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Richard Branson — took up the challenge and became passionate about the universal benefits of investing in space exploration and commercialization.

But if private companies are to make meaningful progress in space exploration, we need the government to help. As President Biden develops his plans to address climate change and other Earth-bound challenges, he would be wise to consider space policy as an extension of his commitments.

Satellite data, for instance, is crucial to understanding the consequences of climate change and our ability to measure mitigation efforts in the future. Yet satellites are vulnerable to both electronic hacks and physical attacks, and there is no international law protecting them. The ability of the United States or other countries to enforce any of the existing rules related to satellites is limited. The United States must work with international bodies, like the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs and the Committee for Peaceful Uses of Space, to establish clear and enforceable guidelines and laws that regulate satellite activity and punish interference by malicious actors

Without this type of international cooperation, we face three distinct problems in space that could lead to conflict and damage: congestion, competition and contested space. With so many nations in space, we need clear international rules. In 2020, investors put about $8.9 billion into space industry startups. But the true commercialization of space will not be sustainable without additional investment by thousands of smaller companies. Without the assurances that financial investments in space are protected by international rules and regulations, these companies may decide the risk is not worthwhile.

Congestion

The low orbit around Earth is now so congested that objects launched must dodge old satellites and debris that shoot through space at 17,000 miles per hour . We need to deal with this congestion because collisions create clouds of debris that jeopardize other satellites and spacecraft. If a big collision occurred , the broken pieces would spread out into a shell of debris that would orbit the Earth for decades. In 2009, when a communications satellite collided with a defunct military satellite, the crash unleashed hundreds of pieces into space.

Globally, we should look to successful treaties that govern air traffic and maritime navigation. If a tanker crashed into another, we know which laws apply. But if a satellite crashes into another nation's space debris, the issues are murkier. Domestically, The Department of Commerce, rather than NASA and the Pentagon, should be charged with creating conditions that encourage private investment and safety in space. Placing responsibility for something as critical as debris tracking and warning notifications for civil, commercial and international space actors would use the Department of Commerce's experience in managing and tracking data related to the free flow of commercial business. We should begin work on an international understanding of space before a major collision occurs that we all will lament was predictable.

Competition

Critically important to the success of the commercialization of space is that no one company or country monopolizes development of any segment, capability or zone of space. Competition will ensure future success, enhance innovation and protect ongoing development from a single point of failure or catastrophic event. Until now, space has been a zone of international cooperation. But advances in space technology and geopolitical events on Earth could imperil future cooperation and access.

Contested space

We must encourage all space-faring countries to create international norms and behaviors.

China and Russia are testing offensive weapons in space that may be able to disable other countries' satellites. We need clear laws that govern how the United States and its allies — and their proxy space companies — cooperate and coordinate with Russia and China, nations that have significant space sectors and complex relationships with the United States. We need to face threats like this head-on and work toward something like a global Federal Aviation Administration for space.

This won't be easy, of course. We need to figure out who gets access to what, how to deter misconduct and how to work together in a fraught diplomatic environment. We need global and domestic treaties and agencies that can resolve conflicts and questions such as: Who can mine on the moon for the rare-earth metals eagerly sought for cell phone and battery production? And how can we extract and share the moon's oxygen and water resources for the purpose of making fuel to power outer space travel? Greater certainty on matters like these will help to build confidence in the new space economy.

America can lead the way. I hope President Biden will build on his predecessor's approach to space by working with Congress and international bodies like the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to set clear rules for space exploration and commercialization.

As the owner of a space technology company, I believe space presents a chance for the United States to make the Earth a greener place and build new international partnerships. What if, by establishing global cooperation on space guidelines, the resulting progress and working relationships on this exciting new frontier could help foster peace? Space could be a place not only to pursue our dreams, but to solve our earthly problems.",2021-03-30 00:00:00
"In Gabriella Miller's memory, a bill to help kids with cancer (Opinion)","Andrew Kaczynski is an investigative reporter and founder of CNN's KFile Team. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

That was the message 10-year-old Gabriella Miller had for US elected officials, just two weeks before she died in 2013 from a deadly brain tumor.

Now they have the opportunity to actually do what Gabriella asked. An excellent piece of legislation named after her is working its way through Congress that would provide desperately needed funding for pediatric cancer research.

Gabriella was diagnosed with a brain cancer known as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG , at age nine. While in treatment, this incredible child worked tirelessly to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and launch the Smashing Walnuts Foundation , a name chosen because her tumor was the size of a walnut. She died less than a year later.

My daughter Francesca, who we affectionately called Beans, also died of brain cancer. Diagnosed in September 2020, our little girl only made it to Christmas Eve before she died from complications of the disease at nine months old. We watched her suffer the terrible effects of her chemotherapy. The deep pain I feel about her final weeks of life spent on a ventilator will always be my motivating factor to push for more money for research on less toxic treatments.

Gabriella Miller

After my daughter died, I tried to learn as much as I could about how we can build a better world for kids with cancer, the number one disease-related killer of children.

I learned that pharmaceutical companies have never developed a drug for pediatric brain cancer, leaving the government and private charities as the main backers of research in the area. Pediatric oncologists lack funding for important research and can struggle to get access to promising drugs developed for adults.

Gabriella's mother Ellyn is working to fill some of that desperate financial need by working with Congress to pass the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0.

In 2013, then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was so moved by Gabriella's activism in the face of terminal cancer that he named legislation after her. The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act shifted funding that was previously allocated for political conventions to pediatric disease research.

Less than six months after her death, it was signed into law by then-President Barack Obama.

That bill created the National Institute of Health's Kids First Pediatric Research Program and Data Resource Center and has allocated millions of dollars to research grants looking into pediatric cancers.

Gabriella Miller

The goal of the Kids First program at NIH is to help researchers find new insights in the biology of childhood cancer and other pediatric disorders. The Data Resource Center wants to build a large-scale database for both clinical and genetic data from kids with cancer, with the goal of finding patterns and new discoveries that will aid research into cures and less harsh treatments.

The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0 would take money from pharmaceutical companies that behave badly and use it to pay for desperately needed pediatric disease research.

The bill, introduced by Virginia Rep. Jennifer Wexton with bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and now awaiting introduction in the Senate, would introduce a new and richer source of funding for the Kids First program. Specifically, it would redirect to Kids First money from penalties paid by pharmaceutical, cosmetic, supplement, and medical device companies that broke the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law.

These penalties total hundreds of millions dollars annually and this legislation would allow the government to fund an important cause without relying on taxpayer dollars or frequent funding efforts in future budgets.

The Coalition Against Childhood Cancer, an association of the biggest organizations fighting pediatric cancer is rallying support for the bill's passage. Last year , the Alliance for Childhood Cancer, another consortium of important stakeholders, sent a letter to members of the House of Representatives announcing their support.

There is no silver bullet for curing pediatric cancer. To truly make a dent, we need to come at the problem relentlessly with creative measures like this new legislation named in beautiful Gabriella's honor.

He is also a former Newton City councilor and business leader, and a major in the Marine Corps Reserves. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Donald Trump left President Joe Biden with many messes to clean up: A raging pandemic, a weakened economy and a cascade of foreign and domestic policies that diminished America's standing on the world stage.

Jake Auchincloss

The US may be winning the race between vaccinations and variants — but the world is losing it. As the US recovery effort picks up steam, we have an opportunity to save lives while rebuilding our moral standing in the world post-Trump. To turbocharge the President's Build Back Better agenda at home and christen a new era of US foreign policy, we need to lead a global vaccination initiative to help the world beat back the pandemic, much like the Marshall Plan aided in Europe's recovery after World War II.

So far, only about six doses have been administered per 100 people worldwide and many countries will not reach herd immunity until 2023, if at all. That timeline doesn't even take into account the possibility that emerging variants could evade the vaccines. The longer it takes to achieve global herd immunity, the more likely it is that Covid-19 will become endemic.

To vaccinate the world faster, the US government needs to provide more funding for COVAX , the global vaccination effort led by the World Health Organization along with UNICEF and other organizations. The United States should also increase direct investments in vaccine manufacturing through public-private partnerships, which would create jobs, leverage vaccine diplomacy and support the biomanufacturing industry, possibly leading to cures for other illnesses as well.

"Ron Weiser, 'Diamond and Silk': There's no place in the US for this vile rhetoric","Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) There are some obvious lessons we should draw from the Jan. 6 insurrection to ensure the United States never sees another attack like that. The first is that all involved, perhaps including Donald Trump for inciting the mob, must be brought to justice to serve as a deterrent to any others who might contemplate similar violence to overturn an election. Another is that the words of political figures and their media allies who appear to be advocating insurrection must be loudly denounced.

In the past few days, we've seen the Michigan GOP state chair invoke the specter of violence against those not loyal to Trump and conservative Trump media allies saying on Newsmax that they wished the military would step in and take over from President Joe Biden. Before the attack on the Capitol this type of language was wrong. Today it feels like a dangerous continuation of the type of incitement that led to the Jan. 6 attack.

Michigan GOP chair Ron Weiser made his comments at a Republican club meeting on Thursday, where he was asked how to remove from office two of the state's Republican members of Congress, Reps. Fred Upton and Peter Meijer, who were among the 10 Republicans who voted with Democrats in February to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection. Weiser responded, ""Other than assassination, I have no other way other than voting out. OK?""

There's absolutely no place for using the word ""assassination"" by any American pollical leader as a tactic to remove political figures you disagree with -- even if, as Weiser claims, the comments were taken out of context. Weiser's comment is especially irresponsible given that Meijer publicly shared in January that he'd bought body armor after death threats against Republicans who'd voted to charge Trump.

Weiser wasn't done with being vile. He also referred to the three statewide female Democratic officials, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, as ""the three witches"" and said his ""job now is to soften up those three witches,"" so come the 2022 election, ""they are ready for the burning at the stake.""

This is not just sexist, but violent imagery that is even more dangerous given that we learned last October Gov. Whitmer had been the target of a plot by right wing militia groups to kidnap and possibly kill her. Fourteen people were charged in the conspiracy, with Whitmer, in response, drawing a straight line to Trump -- who had frequently publicly attacked her and called to ""liberate"" Michigan -- for his refusal ""to condemn White supremacists and hate groups like these two Michigan militia groups.""

Meanwhile, over on the very pro-Trump network Newsmax, the network's weekend co-hosts, Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as ""Diamond and Silk,"" appeared on another show where they made a jaw-dropping call for the US military to remove President Biden from office. After the two shared their view that Biden has ""a cognitive problem"" because he tripped while climbing the stairs of Air Force One, Hardaway added, ""Listen, I wish that the military would step in and take over."" She later demanded that the people currently in charge of our nation need to ""go somewhere, sit down, and allow the military to take over from here.""

Yes, on American television, hosts called for a military coup to overturn our democracy, remove the US President and have the military run the nation.

I called and emailed Newsmax to see if, as a network, it supported or denounced their hosts' call to overthrow our democratically elected government and replace it with military rule. They have not yet responded.

Michigan GOP Chair Weiser, who also serves on the University of Michigan's board of regents, at first refused to apologize for his words, instead remarking he should have ""picked his words more carefully."" Then, in typical Trumpian fashion, he attacked the media and ""leftists"" for overhyping the issue.

Weiser finally offered what The Detroit Free Press dubbed ""an apology of sorts"" on Saturday, after mounting pressure from elected officials and University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel, who slammed Weiser's comments as being ""particularly abhorrent"" after the Jan. 6 attack ""directed at elected officials, our democratic institutions, and the individuals who guard them.""

""I apologize to those I offended for the flippant analogy about three women who are elected officials and for the off-hand comments about two other leaders,"" said Weiser, adding, (to his credit) ""in an increasingly vitriolic political environment, we should all do better to treat each other with respect, myself included.""

These are not normal times. We must swiftly and in one voice denounce political leaders or media pundits who suggest violence or call for a military coup. If not, a Jan. 6-style attack could happen again -- and next time these un-American, anti-democratic forces may prevail.",2021-03-28 00:00:00
Opinion: Joe Biden's Reagan moment,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) In 1983, Rep. Pat Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat, was frying eggs in a nonstick pan one morning when she had an inspiration. Frustrated by then-President Ronald Reagan, she would later declare in a speech on the House floor, ""He has been perfecting the Teflon-coated presidency: He sees to it that nothing sticks to him.""

Actually, at least one thing definitely did stick to Reagan: Schroeder's label. And Teflon, discovered by accident in a DuPont lab in 1938, proved versatile as a political tag. President Bill Clinton, for example, was ""teflonish,"" Schroeder told CNN's Charles Bierbauer in 1997.

Reagan's grandfatherly mien and Hollywood stage presence helped him weather two terms in office, though he did shoulder blame for many controversies. With President Joe Biden two-thirds of the way through his first 100 days, one emerging question is where he will ultimately land on the Teflon scale: as a president stuck with blame for the crises occurring on his watch — or one who largely manages to avoid it?

At his first presidential press conference Thursday, ""the President took tough questions from journalists without making any significant mistakes or verbal stumbles, defended his administration vigorously, and showed a deep and nuanced understanding of a wide range of issues -- and the politics needed for results ,"" wrote

In the Washington Post,observed, ""Try as they might to seem 'tough,' the media did not succeed in knocking Biden off message. Biden spoke in great detail and length to show not only his mastery of the issues but also to suck tension and conflict out of the room .""

All around him, difficulties abound —a struggling economy he'd like to push toward a big recovery, the complicated rollout of an enormous Covid-19 vaccination program, the aftermath of mass shootings -- a week apart -- in Colorado and metro Atlanta, a surge of unaccompanied children over the southern border.

David Axelrod before the press conference. ""Buffeted by unanticipated events and lines of questioning -- and complicated by the President's tendency to occasionally drift off point -- the White House communications machine is hard to control,"" wrotebefore the press conference.

Still, Biden enjoys approval ratings much higher than Donald Trump ever achieved -- an average of 54%, according to FiveThirtyEight

The President is putting his focus on touting the benefits of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill he maneuvered through Congress without any Republican support and aiming to build on it with an infrastructure plan, possibly as big as $3 trillion, he promises to announce this coming week in Pittsburgh. But many of his initiatives, along with a measure to buck new state GOP clampdowns on voting access, may be blocked by Republicans using the Senate filibuster.

Scott Jennings. ""In fact, he took it a step further and said he agreed with former President Barack Obama that the filibuster was 'a relic of the Jim Crow era.' Biden told reporters the ""filibuster was being abused, apparently not recognizing that his own party, a minority in the US Senate for the last six years, used it quite liberally during the Trump administration,"" wrote. ""In fact, he took it a step further and said he agreed with former President Barack Obama that the filibuster was 'a relic of the Jim Crow era.' Does he not remember his 2005 Senate speech passionately defending the filibuster?

Amanda Marcotte wrote that Republicans are depending on the filibuster to keep any bill ""to secure voter rights"" from passage in the Senate. ""After Donald Trump, the GOP understands their party exists because of racism and white grievance. Rather than try to moderate those views and appeal to more diverse voters, Yet many agree with Obama in connecting the filibuster to Jim Crow. In Salon,wrote that Republicans are depending on the filibuster to keep any bill ""to secure voter rights"" from passage in the Senate. ""After Donald Trump, the GOP understands their party exists because of racism and white grievance. Rather than try to moderate those views and appeal to more diverse voters, they instead are laser-focused on trying to prevent people of color from exercising their right to vote .""

As Nicole Hemmer pointed out, ""Jim Crow, a name derived from racist minstrel shows that would come to stand in for the entire segregationist regime of the South, emerged in the late 19th century as a series of anti-Black laws: laws that stripped Black men of the right to vote, segregated public spaces, barred Black people from certain types of jobs."" Stacey Abrams has called Georgia's new voter restrictions law ""a redux of Jim Crow in a suit and tie."" But Hemmer noted that Jim Crow ""never really went away.""

Jim Crow ""marches hand in hand with both state violence and mob violence, as we were once again reminded during the insurrection at the Capitol. In fact, it's precisely because Jim Crow has always been clothed in respectability during the day and worn a hood at night that we should be on alert when we see a Jim Crow-like figure in a business suit, because if history is any indication, that's not the only way we'll see him before all is said and done.""

Seven mass shootings in seven days

SE Cupp noted, it ""was the seventh mass shooting in seven days. That is a nauseating number. It's also a wake-up call. The Boulder shooting, which followed the Atlanta spa shooting, A man carrying a semiautomatic weapon killed 10 people at a Boulder, Colorado supermarket Monday. Asnoted, it ""was the seventh mass shooting in seven days. That is a nauseating number. It's also a wake-up call. The Boulder shooting, which followed the Atlanta spa shooting, is an awful reminder that we have not come close to solving our gun violence problem in this country.""

To do so, she argued, the US should have comprehensive background checks of gun buyers, an improved database of criminals, more studies of gun violence and safety and better ways to stop people with mental health issues from acquiring guns.

Peniel E. Joseph. ""Our public schools and institutions of higher education should be leading ""Congress and the President should pass common-sense gun control laws, complete with stringent background checks, and an assault weapon ban that would reduce the likelihood of mass shootings and gun violence,"" wrote. ""Our public schools and institutions of higher education should be leading a national, data-driven conversation about gun violence as a national public health crisis .""

""As of March 22, over the last seven days, Florida has had the most Covid-19 cases in the country, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the 12th highest per capita case-rate, the fourth highest number of deaths, and the 17th highest death rate.""

Big Lie

The ramifications of former President Donald Trump's big lie that the election was stolen from him continue to ripple out. Prosecutors have charged hundreds of people with crimes as a result of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.

Sidney Powell, a former Trump lawyer responsible for some of the most outlandish and groundless allegations about the election, is trying to defend herself from a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems (the company also filed a suit against Fox News Friday).

Jennifer Rodgers wrote. But Powell was doing more than just offering her opinion. She and her colleagues ""were doing everything in their power to convince Trump's supporters that the election was stolen from him through fraud. ""Powell now argues that she did not defame Dominion because her statements were not factual in nature at all, but instead were merely her opinions,""wrote. But Powell was doing more than just offering her opinion. She and her colleagues ""were doing everything in their power to convince Trump's supporters that the election was stolen from him through fraud. They created and fed the big lie .""

Despite all of the video evidence to the contrary, Trump claimed on Fox News that the Jan. 6 riot ""was zero threat. Look, they went in, they shouldn't have done it. Some of them went in, and they are hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know, they had great relationships.""

Michael D'Antonio pointed out, ""While one officer appeared to pose for a selfie with a rioter and others opened the barricades to allow the mob to enter the grounds of the US Capitol, many Capitol and DC Metro police officers also risked their lives and engaged in hand-to-hand combat trying to protect the lawmakers who were certifying the results of the 2020 election inside. During the melee, some officers were beaten and sprayed with chemicals.

During the melee, some officers were beaten and sprayed with chemicals. At least 138 sustained injuries including burns, concussions and rib fractures. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died from injuries sustained during the attack, and two others later died by suicide.""

Julian Zelizer. ""But it won't be easy for him to regain his hold. Meanwhile, an adviser said Trump is readying a new social platform to air his views, now that he has been banned from Twitter. ""Trump hates not being heard,"" wrote. ""But it won't be easy for him to regain his hold. After all, the former president is now officially a political loser .""

Suez

A 1,300-foot container ship called Ever Given gave the world of international shipping a body blow Wednesday. It ran aground in the Suez Canal, a waterway that carries 12% of the world's shipping, and blocked traffic, stranding hundreds of ships.

""A failure of machinery, human error or natural events -- high winds and reduced visibility -- may have caused Ever Given to run ashore in the Suez Canal,"" wrote Salvatore R. Mercogliano, a history professor and former merchant mariner.

""But its impact will resonate far from its banks as it has blocked the jugular of one of the largest trade routes in human history.""

Opinion: What Biden's top economic priority must be,"Watch the full conversation with SE Cupp, Michael Hicks and Rana Foroohar on ""What Comes Next?"" here . Michael J. Hicks is the George & Frances Ball Distinguished Professor and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. He studies regional economics and public finance and is a retired army infantry officer. The views expressed in this opinion are his own.

When President-elect Joe Biden assumes office in January, he will face economic challenges that are arguably greater than any president has dealt with since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

As 2020 draws to a close, we say goodbye to the worst year for our economy since the Great Depression.

However, all the news is not bad news.

There are no obvious financial bubbles, and given the stock market expansion , consumers and investors appear confident about the long run. Meanwhile, American household savings are substantially better than a year ago. Moreover, the end of the pandemic could unleash strong economic growth from pent up demand. And the news about vaccine development provides more certainty about the end date of the pandemic.

Still, the short-term economic damage from the pandemic will likely persist for several more years. And the long-term damage, particularly to children and young adults , may last for decades. Because of this, Covid-19 relief should be the first economic policy priority of the Biden administration.

The next round of Covid relief must accomplish two things. First, it must extend the supplemental pandemic unemployment insurance that has sustained more than 10 million families since March. Second, the bill must provide support to state and local governments that face catastrophic revenue shortfalls well into 2022.

Failure to replace state and local government tax losses will have damaging effects, deepening the downturn and potentially adding years to a full recovery. The scope of tax losses could mean layoffs of teachers, firefighters and police across much of the nation.

In fact, since January, approximately 1 million local government employees have already lost their jobs. But it also means significant reductions in public services next year. Education and health care, which comprise more than half of state and local budgets, will be hard hit, but summer 2021 may also see public pools and parks remain closed as municipal and state governments struggle to balance budgets.

The House passed a version of pandemic relief with a $2.2 trillion estimated cost in the spring. That eye-popping figure is obviously a starting point for budget reconciliation, but with potential vaccine availability limiting the impact of this disease next year, a more modestly funded compromise between the House and Senate may be possible.

While GOP resistance to this size of relief has been characterized as a bailout to poorly run states, that rhetoric is simply wrong. Estimates of fiscal shortfalls produced by Ball State University's Center for Business and Economic Research calculate that California will remain solvent long after Indiana, Missouri and Arkansas have exhausted their rainy-day funds. As Moody's Analytics concluded in a recent report, the economic distress facing states is caused by the fallout of Covid, not fiscal mismanagement.

The current CARES Act provided the Payroll Protection Plan (PPP), designed to forestall business layoffs, as well as extend benefits for Covid-related unemployment. But the CARES Act ends in December, and even a modestly better functioning federal government would be working toward a quick compromise.

But we face the pandemic with the government we have, not the government we wished we had. So, a new relief bill should provide a good working example of compromise for the next administration. And though such a bill seems increasingly unlikely in the short term, it is incredibly important because there are other urgent priorities that require bipartisan cooperation.

Infrastructure week has become a running joke on social media, yet there are few issues that have as much cross-party support as upgrading America's aging infrastructure.

The Biden infrastructure plan calls for $2 trillion of spending . This is more than earlier transit plans , but not out of range of all federal infrastructure spending over a typical five to seven year spending plan. Disagreement in Congress often arises when members discuss the scope of spending, rather than its size. That makes infrastructure ripe for early and significant efforts to improve the spirit of compromise.

There is also substantial overlap between parts of the Green New Deal and infrastructure spending that would boost business productivity. For example, investments in smart transportation systems , which is a priority of both progressives and fiscal conservatives, could be claimed by both the Chamber of Commerce and environmentalists as major political victories.

Many investments could also reduce costs for local governments with more energy efficient buildings and lower transportation costs. Again, this should appeal to a broad political constituency, easing the path to congressional compromise and setting the stage for future cooperation.

After Covid and infrastructure, the hard work begins. Following the pandemic, the United States will face record debt and deepened economic inequality between people and places. We still have rapidly rising health care spending , a counterproductive trade war that weakened US manufacturing and comprehensive immigration reform to contend with. We need longer term paths to constructive compromise.

Over the past few decades, the United States has moved away from federalism, where state and local government take a more active role in determining their own best course of action on many of our most divisive issues. This weakens our ability to craft compromises.

Increased federalism allows state and local governments to more boldly experiment with spending and regulatory changes, easing many of the stickiest political impasses, while allowing the laboratory of the states to experiment with policies. We are too diverse a nation to find easy one-size-fits-all solutions.

There are good examples of the benefits of federalism. For example, the durability of the Affordable Care Act rests heavily on its state level flexibility in allowing co-payments and incentives for healthy behaviors that make its costs more palatable to taxpayers. Even then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence adopted its Medicaid expansion provisions because they fit easily into the state's existing Healthy Indiana Plan.

President-elect Biden faces an historically weakened economy and strengthening pandemic. He also steps into office in an age of deep political distrust. As he fights the economic fallout of Covid, he has a rare chance to resurrect the mechanisms of compromise that have served the United States well for 244 years.",2020-12-01 00:00:00

(CNN) This week, we ask the question: What comes next for America and disinformation? The past four years have seen an alarming erosion in the public trust in news, coupled with a spread of conspiracy theories, junk science and outright falsehoods by none other than the President of the United States. With a new president elected, how does Joe Biden help steer the country back toward facts, science and truth? SE Cupp talks to CNN Senior Political Analyst John Avlon about all this and more in our CNN Digital video discussion, but first Avlon tackles the future of fact checking in a CNN Opinion op-ed.

Fact checking has been a growth industry in the Trump era.

The sheer velocity of Donald Trump's false and misleading statements -- along with the proliferation of disinformation on social media -- have demanded significant fact-checking to defend liberal democracy.

The market responded to the demand: According to the Duke Reporter's Lab, global fact checking organizations grew from 145 in 2016 to 304 by mid-2020.

But will the need for fact checking lose its urgency when Trump leaves the White House?

Let's start by recognizing reality. Fact checking Democrats this election cycle has offered a far less target rich environment. This is not because either party has a monopoly on virtue or vice, but because Democrats' falsehoods during their presidential debates have been comparatively pedestrian -- likely to focus on competing claims about calculating the 10-year cost of Medicare for All, or who wrote-what-gun control bill, or how many manufacturing jobs have been lost , or when a candidate really started supporting a raise in the minimum wage.

Make no mistake: It's essential to clarify policy disagreements and insist on fact-based debates. But it's not exactly got the moral urgency of fact checking the President's retweet of baseless Osama Bin Laden conspiracy theories, or blaming rising Covid-19 infection rates on more testing, or demanding the investigation of political opponents, or saying that Joe Biden is ""against God"" -- all in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign.

But even if President-elect Biden is not going to be found the ""single largest driver"" of coronavirus misinformation in the world, as a Cornell University study declared Trump, the need for fact checking is not going away.

That's because the disinformation ecosystem is still proliferating via social media and the hyper-partisan fragmentation of society. Trump is a symptom rather than its root cause. There is every reason to hope that the presence of a president who does not lie all the time will not exacerbate our divides on a daily basis. But it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the underlying infrastructure of hate news and fake news will be solved with a new president.

""If we do not have the capacity to distinguish what's true from what's false, then by definition the marketplace of ideas doesn't work,"" former President Barack Obama recently told The Atlantic . ""And by definition our democracy doesn't work.""

Democracy depends upon reasoning together. And that's what is being threatened. The old KGB hand, now Russian President Vladimir Putin understood that social media presented an unprecedented opportunity to proliferate disinformation, while most Americans were still waxing poetic about its potential to bring people together.

In fairness, it can do both -- but without established guardrails and updated standards, we've learned the hard way that lies spread faster on social media than the truth. The prominence of the toxic nonsense QAnon conspiracy theory in Republican circles, and exit polls showing that 51% of Americans think the efforts to contain the coronavirus are going well (when cases are spiking and our country has almost 20% of the world's deaths) indicate just how much the rot has set in.

Reforms are necessary. As I've written before on CNN Opinion, ""Social media and tech platforms have a responsibility not to run knowingly false advertisements or promote intentionally false stories. They must disclose who is paying for digital political ads and crack down on the spread of disinformation. The Honest Ads Act would require the same disclosures that are required on television and radio right now. This is a no brainer. The profit motive from hate news and fake news might be reduced by moving digital advertising toward attention metrics to measure and monetize reader engagement and loyalty, incentivizing quality over clickbait. But perhaps the single biggest reform would come from social media companies requiring that accounts verify they are real people, rather than bots that bully people and manipulate public opinion.""

But these reforms will not be speedy, and they are not sufficient. The core responsibility of journalism is to tell the truth -- especially at a time when our civil discourse is polluted by lies. We need to call balls and strikes and help people make sense of all the chaos that surrounds them. And, of course, every administration needs to be held to account by the press, even if not every president calls journalists ""the enemy of the people."" That's why we need to not just fact check, but add perspective -- the very thing we have least of in our politics today -- offered up with a bit of history and humor, as I try to do with my daily Reality Checks on CNN's ""New Day.""

Some of these efforts will be evergreen -- searchable for people looking to separate fact from fiction or simply to get up to speed on a given topic. Others will surf off the day's news-cycle. But, in the larger sense, we need to fight and win the war on disinformation, especially at a time when ethno-nationalist autocracies around the world are cracking down on freedom of the press to solidify their hold on power.

It would be a huge mistake to assume that simply because the velocity of lies from the White House is likely to decrease dramatically that the need for fact checks has expired. Instead, it has only transformed to a broader arena than a presidential beat. It's the part of news that people need most now, the tip of the spear that fights for the idea that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts.

This is necessary for a substantive, civil and fact-based debate, which is a precondition for a functioning, self-governing society. And that's why fact checking will remain a core responsibility for journalists in the future.",2020-11-17 00:00:00
Former White supremacist: This is how to tackle hate and bigotry,"Watch the full conversation with SE Cupp and her panel of experts on ""What Comes Next?"" here . Christopher Buckley of LaFayette, Georgia, is an Afghanistan war veteran. He is a former White supremacist. Now he spreads awareness and educates the public about the dangers of extremism through his work with the nonprofit group Parents For Peace . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) This week, we ask the question: What comes next for America and hate? The federal government lists White supremacy as a top threat to national security, thanks in part to a rise in White nationalism over the past four years. With a new president elected, how does Joe Biden confront the scourge of racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny and xenophobia that President Donald Trump helped stoke? SE Cupp talks to a panel of experts for our CNN Digital video discussion, but first, former White supremacist Chris Buckley writes our CNN Opinion op-ed.

According to the US Department of Homeland Security, White supremacy is the biggest security threat facing the United States today based on the number of violent crimes committed. It eclipses all other types of extremism.

Hate and bigotry are now bigger than they have ever been. And because of the internet , it has become easier for hate groups to spread propaganda and attract new members.

Among these groups are active US military personnel and veterans.

I would know -- because that was me. After serving in Afghanistan, I officially joined the White Knights of the KKK in 2014. The skills that I learned in the military, like a heightened level of mental and tactical awareness, are exactly what groups like this valued for the purpose of training new members. I was a prime target to be groomed and recruited.

Hate and anger were things that I had dealt with since childhood.

As a young man, I was a survivor of molestation. I became extremely homophobic because of this. My racism developed after I started taking the bus to a school with other races. As one of the few White kids in that school, I suffered a lot of racial bullying. The more confrontations and bullying I experienced, the more confident I became in my beliefs.

Because I was so vulnerable as a child and had not dealt with those early traumas, I was searching for a way to feel strong and dominant as an adult. In some ways. Being in the military allowed me to bury, not resolve, my childhood traumas, but it also created new traumas when I lost comrades.

During my service in Afghanistan, my best friend was killed in an unexpected attack on a routine drill. He died in my arms, and I blamed Muslims for his death. We were trained to see them as the enemy. I came home with a hatred for Islam as well as an addiction to the painkillers I was prescribed after a back injury. I had been trained in the military to serve with duty and loyalty. I would have done anything to show my loyalty to the White Knights of the KKK. It gave me a sense of purpose that I was missing after I came home.

White supremacy, in many ways, filled a void in my life.

But my life in the KKK was a miserable cycle of perpetuated violence and hate, fueled by drugs and enhanced by the media's rhetoric against us. If you look for hate, you will find it. It was exhausting, and there was nothing positive about my experience when I look back. It was not good or exciting. I was on a constant high on supremacy, hatred and free narcotics. In the group, there was always someone there who had drugs. You could pretty much pick your poison and someone there gave you what you wanted.

In early 2015, while shopping in a supermarket with our toddler, my wife was threatened by a group of women because they knew that her husband was in the KKK. At that moment, she knew that if she didn't do something, our family would be harmed.

A few weeks after this incident, my wife decided to find help and Googled ""how to get your husband out of a hate group."" She found Arno Michaelis , a former Neo-Nazi, online and emailed him for help.

Arno was once the lead singer of the White power rock band, ""Centurion,"" and is now an accomplished anti-hate activist who also works with Parents For Peace.

My wife didn't think she would hear back, but Arno responded and flew down to meet me and take on the intervention. At first, I was extremely resistant and angry. But he was patient with me and helped me get sober and find my way back to who I was before the hate consumed me. This process took a few years.

Arno not only helped me address my trauma and pain but he also introduced me to Dr. Heval Kelli, a Kurdish Muslim refugee who is now a cardiologist, in 2018. Arno met Dr. Kelli at an event in Georgia. Dr. Kelli had done a lot of community outreach work to build bridges between Muslims and the rest of his community.

Because of the love and compassion they showed me, I was able to move forward in my life and give back. Now I help people disengage from hate groups, return to their families, and live healthy and happy lives.

Many people have asked, how can the problem of hate be solved? That is a very tough question to answer.

I believe the cure for hate is education and healing from one's own issues and trauma. Many extremists who I have encountered suffer from similar emotional and physical issues that I dealt with.

Through my own intervention and in helping others, I have found that treating those issues requires getting help, in part, from someone who has lived the same experiences. Treatment often begins with recognizing and isolating the root of hatred.

As a former White supremacist and drug addict, I started to wonder if it was possible to be addicted to hate the way I was addicted to drugs as a coping tool. Based on this, I have spent the last two years developing two programs aimed at addressing the root causes of hate with Parents For Peace , which takes a public health approach to preventing radicalization, extremism, and violence.

I believe the most common causes of hate can be broken down into three categories: mental health, substance abuse and early trauma or grievances -- all of which applied to me. While I think that the government is interested in finding a cure to this problem, through actions like awarding grants to agencies that try to counter extremism, the government needs help from an appropriate team of advisers to address the issue of prevention effectively.

Many people who are in this situation are not comfortable calling government-funded organizations. So, on many occasions, the people who need it the most aren't being helped.

Additionally, the government often cannot act if a crime hasn't been committed. That is why Parents For Peace's work is so important. The organization focuses on prevention and intervention to keep people from becoming extremists or committing extremist acts. Our work is challenging, and the outcomes are positive but silent.

Treating the causes of hate requires youth resilience, community-based counternarratives and education and deradicalization programs. To be effective, the programs should be available to schools, first responders and community leaders.

That's what I'm aiming to do with Hate Anonymous and Trauma Anonymous (TraumAnon), two programs that I'm developing. Both are programs developed to identify, isolate, address and heal the traumas people experience in their lives. I treat addiction to hate the same way I treated my addiction to substances. At Parents For Peace, we call hate ""the drug of choice.""

Through Hate Anonymous and TraumAnon, we offer a 12-week course in which certified professionals provide mental health services. We work with participants and family members to get to the root cause of hate and extremism.

While these programs are currently in the pilot phase, they are based on cases that Parents For Peace deals with every day. For example, in 2017, Parents For Peace helped a mother who called the helpline about her son who was involved with White supremacy, lashed out at people who were different than him and planned to participate in the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally. The son was drinking heavily and had access to a significant number of guns. Parents For Peace worked with the mother to create a plan that put her son on the road to recovery.

If we think of hate as a public health crisis and a disease, we should treat it as such. It is the only way to effectively combat the rise of extremism.",2020-11-12 00:00:00
"After bitterly divided election, what's next for America (opinion)","(CNN) After nearly five breathless days of vote-counting, the American people -- and the world -- got the news Saturday: Joe Biden would be the next president of the United States. So, where to now, nation? CNN Opinion asked 26 commentators to consider the question: What does the outcome of this election say about America in 2020? The opinions are their own.

Penn Jillette: You have one job, Joe

Okay, so it's not over, there will be court fights, but Joe has won. I used to identify as Libertarian, I used to have opinions on government. I used to think I disagreed with Joe Biden on most everything, but I voted for him. I wanted the other guy fired and I wanted Joe hired and for me the job description is now very simple. I need Joe to love all the Trump supporters. I don't care if Joe raises taxes. I don't care if Joe helps add stupid, counterproductive regulations. I don't care about anything except love and kindness.

I've never seen Joe as a hero, but now we need a Nelson Mandela. We need MLK. And it needs to be Joe. We need someone who can love the people who hated him and lied about him. He must rise to the occasion.

Half the country voted for Trump. These people did not buy a pig in a poke like in 2016, these were people who knew what they were voting for and voted anyway. It's appalling and horrifying, but these people are not monsters. These people are our neighbors and our relatives. These people are us, and we need someone who can teach us to love them again.

Joe started saying the right things already, but he has to go all the way. Please, Joe, make me embarrassed to say anything bad about Trump supporters. Please fill all our hearts with love for each other. Please. This is Joe's chance to have the situation make him better than he has any right to be. Please teach us to love and understand and move on together.

You have one job, Joe -- love all of us.

Luvvie Ajayi Jones: A mirror is being held up to our nation's face

Luvvie Ajayi Jones

Donald Trump, the inglorious captain of this sinking ship, has revealed the United States' flaws, which can never be un-seen. In America—a nation that is supposed to be a global leader—this year has been a raging dumpster fire, stoked by the whims of a raging narcissist of a president, a man with the emotional intelligence of a spoiled kindergartner.

Yes, Joe Biden will be the 46th president, but the fact that nearly half of the Americans who voted chose Trump is telling. The last four years have held a mirror up to this country's face, and the ugly reflection will be unyielding until we do something to fix it. Over 70 million people still voted for -- or didn't care enough to vote against -- Trump's cruelty. It is further proof that this land and all its systems are broken. And White supremacy is at the core.

This election should have been such a quick landslide loss for Trump and the Republicans. Instead, we had to sit tight to make sure all votes were being counted. We had to watch and listen to Trump spew baseless claims of voter fraud. We watched Trump rally his base with lie after lie and tweet after tweet. And as this happened, the other half of America held its breath, waiting for confirmation that the man who many saw as the walking epitome of the last gasp of White supremacy would be on his way out of the White House.

America is broken and it needs to be fixed.

George Takei: What we have just regained

George Takei

""At long last, have you left no sense of decency?""

These words, uttered on June 9, 1954, by a lawyer named Joseph Nye Welsh, marked a turning point in Senator Joseph McCarthy's infamous hearings. In a single moment of clarity, McCarthy's worst excesses, fear mongering and bullying were laid bare by a simple call for decency.

This election, the American people once again called the question of basic decency, and they found it utterly wanting in Trump, who from day one debased his office with his lies, pettiness, ignorance and incompetence. For no matter their politics, the American people can stomach only so much of an indecent fellow. Deep within us is an abiding sense that our leaders ought to reflect the values we hope to teach our children. And while some may still be blinded and trapped within his cult of personality, most Americans know that Trump isn't a decent man.

Enter Joe Biden, who even his biggest critics admit is wholesome and good at his very core. There were no optics or spin needed. Decency was on the ballot in the form of Joe Biden, and through his election, we have regained our deepest sense of it.

Danielle Pletka: America between the coasts is alive and well

Danielle Pletka

In the wake of former Vice President Joe Biden's tight victory in the presidential race, it will be tempting to look at the razor thin margins across the map and declare the nation a house irretrievably divided. But there are other more cheering conclusions to be drawn. American democracy is alive and well, the complaints of partisans notwithstanding. Votes were counted (and will be recounted), courts will field litigants, state officials will do their jobs. The process was far from smooth, and beyond frustrating to watch, but that is a democratic system in action.

Better still, and despite strenuous efforts to pigeonhole Americans into their hyphenated identity groups, Blacks, Latinos and many other non-White voters walked into their voting booths (or post offices) with diverse ideas about the best man to lead the nation...and voted for Republicans in unprecedented numbers. They did not vote by tribe, they voted for -- and against -- policies that mattered in their lives. Are there still divisions among us? Of course, there always will be. But more than 65% of eligible Americans believed in the power of their vote, and our democracy.

Finally, how heartening it is to be reminded that journalistic, tech and business elites do not call elections, and that money -- notwithstanding the hundreds of millions wasted in trying to do so -- cannot buy a seat in Congress. There is an America between the coasts, and it's alive and well and kicking.

Baratunde Thurston: We have passed this phase of our democracy stress test

Baratunde Thurston

For the past four years, I have been holding my breath, in a defensive crouch and bracing for the worst. I've expected some fresh horror, embarrassment or trauma to find its way onto one of my screens, and it's been exhausting. My soul has been clenched and now, with the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, my heart is lifted, and I can exhale.

I had dreamed, briefly, of an instant, massive, electoral rebuke of the outgoing president. I momentarily let visions of a landslide dance in my head. That did not happen. This is still the United States of America that elected the 45th president to begin with, still the nation that only decided in 2020 that Black lives might matter, still the nation too-long governed by GOP minority rule, thanks to the Electoral College, gerrymandering, voter suppression and an open-armed embrace of misinformation and White supremacy.

But now, at least, we have a fighting chance. Once again, overwhelming action by Black voters has dragged America, partially kicking and screaming, back from beyond the brink and toward a more perfect version of our union. Indigenous and Latinx communities showed up. Honestly, everyone showed up, from every race and every place, to flex their power and reclaim our democracy.

This was a victory not just for a Democratic ticket, but for our democracy and sadly, for basic decency. Now it's up to all of us to continue to invest in and defend it. We are ready to move forward.

Watching Vice President-Elect Harris and President Elect-Biden give their victory speeches, I know they are ready to heal and move forward too. Let's join them. Let's stay engaged in the process of self-governance well beyond this election. Let's be the nation we've always said we could be.

Like a lot of people, Biden wasn't my first choice. To me, he was a wise and empathetic grandpa who gave good hugs. Then he chose Kamala Harris as his running mate. My excitement was tempered by exasperation that we needed an older White man to pass the baton to a woman. But Kamala isn't just any woman. She's a woman of color, a child of immigrants with a name drawn from Indian mythology. That gave me hope for where this country is headed today.

Another woman of color, Stacey Abrams, galvanized the masses to vote. And that gave me more hope. Yes, we are a country divided, but what this election says about America is that even when you feel like you're screaming into a black hole, your voice can be heard. Your voice counts.

The 19th amendment was ratified exactly one century ago, but it took longer for women of color to enfranchise. This country was built—shamefully-- on the backs of African Americans. But today this country will grow and prosper through the power and generosity of women of color. Yes, we'll have another old White guy as our next president. But a heartbeat away from the presidency— prepared and ready to lead the United States at a moment's notice—will be a strong, tough, smart, progressive African and South Asian American woman in Chuck Taylor All Stars married to a nice Jewish guy who is undoubtedly verklempt. And that makes me heartened, hopeful and proud. I'm ready for that hug, Joe.

Rev. William J. Barber II: We can have a genuine democracy

William Barber

Since Donald Trump eked out an Electoral College victory in 2016, he has proudly displayed a US map that highlights in red the counties he won despite losing the national popular vote to Hillary Clinton by more than 3 million. The point of the map, like the financial statements he used for years to apply for credit, was to claim legitimacy. A President who never had the support of a majority of Americans pretended to represent most of the country. But the red mirage was always an illusion.

In Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Republican-led legislatures fought hard to help Trump maintain this appearance of legitimacy on Election Night by delaying the counting of overwhelmingly Democratic mail-in ballots. But elections are not decided by candidates or state legislators. In a democracy, elections are decided by the people.

Donald Trump did not create the myth of a ""red"" electoral map. He simply exploited it. But 40 years after Republicans strategists began using what they called ""positive polarization"" to pit some Americans against their neighbors in battle ground states, Trump's extremism has revealed a larger and more diverse electorate that has the power to re-shape priorities in American public life.

More than 74 million Americans voted to repudiate Trumpism, and fusion coalitions led by poor and low-income voters in North Carolina and Georgia demonstrated their power to make races competitive that Republicans could until recently count on winning without a fight.

From living wages to health care, immigration and the climate crisis, the most pressing issues we face are not red or blue issues, but moral issues that compel us to face who we are and who we want to become as a nation. This election has revealed that, while the forces of division are strong, the possibility of a genuine democracy is stronger still. Our task now is to build together an America that works for all of us.

Poorna Jagannathan: I am not American, but I am America

Poorna Jagannathan

There's a particular blue. In my head, I call it tower blue. It's the color of the sky on the horrendous day when the Twin Towers fell. I associate that blue with an intense love, and a sense of belonging to a city--to a country--where until then I felt like a guest. I associate that blue with my epiphany: the actions of one can affect another; our destinies and humanity are interconnected. It was the day I felt ""American,"" despite not being a citizen. Belonging is hard to describe. But when it's threatened, it comes into clear focus.

I came here in 1991 for college. An immigrant. I worked in marketing for 15 years but spent every weekend taking acting classes and working as an usher, so that I could see plays. I had no connections to Hollywood. More than 25 years later, I report to work on a set to play an Indian immigrant mom raising her teenage daughter in Southern California. That's America: a place where you are never too late and the impossible is possible.

Now, I look at the redness on the electoral map—it covers so much of this country. I'm grappling with the fact that rather than inviting me in, this red carpet might be there to usher me out—to say I'm not wanted here. But the blue speaks loud and clear: and it says I am needed. People of color, immigrants, anyone who has had to fight to belong are actually the ones who remind the rest of the principle of democracy. That until we are equal, equality will be elusive. That until we belong this country will be divided. That our dream counts. My America is full of people who are needed.

It feels in this fraught, post-election period like there's no middle ground anymore and that the ground beneath my own feet is shifting, unstable. But then I see that half Indian, half Black woman standing on that stage in her white suit, meeting America as its Vice President-elect-- and I can't help but keep my eyes trained on that blue sky.

Nicole Hemmer: Will Americans lose even more faith in government?

Nicole Hemmer

A partial explanation for the big polling misses in 2020 — and the polls did miss, substantially more than 2016 — centers on the low-trust voter, who believes the system is corrupt, rigged or not interested in helping people like them. It's a demographic the Trump campaign successfully cultivated over the last four years, using the President's permanent campaign to find and register low-trust voters and rally them to the polls.

The result of this year's election, though, will almost certainly continue to degrade their faith in institutions — along with the rest of Americans. A Democratic president hamstrung by a Republican Senate will face a hard limit on the kind of structural reforms the country desperately needs, from voting rights to court reform. And other much-needed policies hugely popular with the American people, from immigration to green energy to gun safety, will almost certainly be blocked by the Senate if it stays Republican.

Most Americans want a functioning government that passes policies they like — they just don't believe that will actually happen. And if Democrats fail to eke out a victory in the Senate special elections, it probably won't.

Garry Kasparov: America cannot pretend that the last four years never happened

Garry Kasparov

Joe Biden's victory is America turning back from the brink. He is a symbol of moderation, the embodiment of America's rejection both of Sanders socialism and Trumpist venality. While the highest turnout since 1900 is encouraging, the country is still dangerously divided, leaving it vulnerable to another demagogue. America cannot pretend that the last four years never happened.

Republicans are holding the Senate and gaining in the House, a warning to Democrats that identity politics and a radical progressive agenda are best left to only the bluest enclaves. Voters told Biden to stick to his narrow mandate as a repairman, not play savior. Close the loopholes, codify the checks and balances, reform the election process, dam the flood of dark money and foreign influence. Return elections to policies, not personalities.

The election wasn't just about ideology, or Covid or Trump fatigue. Americans want their government to represent them, and for America to rejoin the world and to stand for the values of its founding. This will be a heroic mission precisely because it is so unassuming, and that's why Joe Biden could be the hero we need. If his presidency is a success, American democracy will never again be on the ballot.

Deadly sins, joyful wins, faceless grins, typhoons, monsoons, earthquakes, fires, monsters within, with nothing to give. Divided, united, requited, trans-lighted, we stand, so tall, sometimes with little left, still ready for the call; we are a nation, one built for us all. It feels almost useless, brutal and clueless. Yet, we are so fruitful, beautiful and cute, and yeah, full of news for you all. We won't be crushed by the desire to hush us. We won't go down with the uptown, the push down, the put downs. We are the United, the Rising the Together WE Stand not the put down the smasher of our loved common man. We will turn up and show up and take this country, this land. Turn it around, give love to our towns and shake up and break up the lost, the unfound. We will love them to submission, soothe the souls of their condition, this is the nation that prides itself on freedom, that will never be your kingdom. So: we pack up your showboats, your show wife, your show and no tell and go somewhere, yeah there where they wanted you to sell them our decency and our country. Because we, yeah, we, United We Stood, and protected our hood, with dignity and justice for ALL.

Mikki Kendall: Crisis averted...for now?

Mikki Kendall

Calling ourselves a free country means working towards freedom for all; not just for those lucky enough to be somewhat insulated by privilege. This year it looks like America will have to reckon with that reality, instead of pretending exceptionalism is equality.

America has consistently chosen to make politics into a crisis every few years instead of an ongoing effort to fulfill its promises to itself and the world. The impact of that attitude is a slow-motion avalanche of deprivation, especially for marginalized communities. The problems pile up until they reach a breaking point, and then American voters are forced to focus on harm reduction instead of advancement.

When an election cycle is about shielding the most at-risk people from some of the impact of otherwise catastrophic policies, then can we genuinely call it a victory? Or are we merely putting out part of a fire and leaving the rest to burn?

This year America chose to save itself from an immediate crisis, but there is still a long hard road ahead to clean up existing problems and to prevent creating new ones. We can only hope that the American Dream begins to come true, and that some form of healing is possible.

Mandy Patinkin: America's myth can be its reality

Mandy Patinkin

In 2020, decency was on the ballot, and more Americans voted to defend it than have voted for any candidate in history. In a year when hundreds of thousands of Americans have perished to a global pandemic, and millions more fear for their livelihoods, we have elected a President whose empathy and capacity to sit with suffering rank among his chief hallmarks. On January 20, 2021, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in as president and vice president—the two embodying a series of ""firsts"" in their new roles.

And we know we have work to do. The election shone a spotlight on the polarization, distrust and enmity toward neighbors and fellow citizens that have defined these last four years. President Donald Trump got more votes this year than he did in 2016. But our problems are not confined to one man, and neither will they end with his departure.

Our democracy survives, but so do the fault lines that imperiled it. Healing a broken nation will not be the work of one politician or one party. I truly believe that what binds us together as Americans is stronger than what divides us, and that, together, we can make the myth of what America can be a reality.

Even in the midst of this splendid dawn, even as we awake with relief from the dark fever of a seemingly endless night and celebrate, along with multiple dancing citizens, that the republic is not beyond redemption, we must remember that other nightmares await us.

If it were only a matter of the damage Trump will likely inflict before he surrenders the Presidency. Or his legacy of a worsening pandemic, a degraded environment, a wounded democracy, a land racked by violence, racial injustice and hatred of immigrants.

The persisting nightmare is that, ignoring the culture of corruption in Trump's White House, his callousness and serial mendacity, over seventy million estranged fellow Americans almost reelected him, a man whose own niece, psychologist Mary Trump, calls a ""sociopath."" And one who embodies a lingering malignancy in America's DNA.

To convince enough of them to journey with us to a more luminous future is the major challenge ahead. For this, we desperately need radical change and a shift in consciousness, to look together into the mirror of our national identity and recognize its most twisted manifestations, above all the myth of exceptionalism.

In order to truly awaken and heal we must continue to unleash the courage, energy, joy and, yes, compassion with which rebellious millions managed to defy fear and keep hope alive in these traumatic times.

Sean Penn: Our new heroes

Sean Penn

Election campaigns, even in the calmest of times, shine a white-hot light on division. They are passion plays staged by politicians, the news media and advertisers, powered by fear and loathing.

In 2020, with the pain of the American people intensified by a pandemic and economic agony, the presidential race was dominated by stories of enemies who traveled in packs, drawing courage from their partisan ""communities""—identified by themselves or others: ""deplorables."" ""liberals,"" ""White nationalists,"" ""socialists,"" ""MAGAs"" and so on.

But there were few symbols of individualized courage who sustained notice. Where was Martin? Where was Medgar? Who were Bobby and John? Who was Muhammad Ali? In this culture of complaint, we travel as tribe members, rather than as persons. But not everyone.

For me, this awful period of American history is redeemed by the shining face of Emma Gonzalez, who in 2018, at only 18 years old stepped briefly into the national spotlight as an advocate for sanity on gun control. She and her fellow students who survived the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting in Florida that February had no time to organize as a pack.

They stepped forward and stood up as individuals in one of the most extraordinary shows of poise and courage I have ever seen -- a heroism any adult could ever aspire to. They are the next generation. We have survived this noisy election, but our long-term survival will depend on our ability to listen to young heroes like Emma.

Oren Cass: Don't kid yourself about what elections reveal about America

Oren Cass

Election results determine who governs us, they do not tell us who we are. America was, and is, the nation that elected George W. Bush in 2000 but could just as easily have elected Al Gore. Roughly the same electorate who made Barack Obama a two-term president chose Donald Trump at its next opportunity, though with the slightest of tweaks in a few states we could be approaching the end of Hillary Clinton's first term. Assessing our national condition based on whether a few thousand votes went one way or the other in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania on Tuesday is the rankest of punditry.

People like to see America as an Obama or Trump or Biden nation because it allows them to feel proud when their side is in power and appalled when it is not; to imagine that others with whom they disagree are a solvable problem, just one blue or red ""wave"" away from disappearing for good. In reality, America is an Obama, Romney, Clinton, Trump, Biden nation all at once, which no particular result will change.

The lesson to learn from this election is that, whoever you supported, about half of your fellow citizens felt otherwise. Neither vilifying nor condescending to them will change any minds. If you cannot understand how they could reach conclusions so different from your own, the fault lies with you, not them.

Ashley Judd: We need a profound pivot

Ashley Judd

On her inner-thighs, she painted ""VOTE TRUMP."" She hitched her feet in the stirrups and spread her legs for surgery on her urethra, displaying to everyone in the operating room her political loyalty. If she had died during the procedure, she would have done so with Donald Trump between her legs. She is a White woman.

She is a White woman with whom I am close. We talk daily. She was laughing as she told me.

I suggested her political statement on the skin so close to her vagina could have elicited a variety of reactions in the OR workers--and not necessarily positive ones. For anyone who happened not to share her political affiliation, it might even create a hostile work environment.

Her reaction to my concerns was that the doctors, nurses and orderlies, were ""there to serve me"" and she had been ""friends with the urologist for forty one years"" and ""could do whatever she wanted.""

We are a people cleaved.

Our political system, as starkly revealed by the 2020 presidential election, can neither save nor heal us. We are standing as a people in what Quaker elder and activist Parker Palmer calls the Tragic Gap —the gap between corrosive cynicism and irrelevant idealism, between the way things are and the way we know they might be.

A profound pivot from our collective selfishness and self-centeredness to other-centeredness is the only thing that can save us now. To heal the Tragic Gap we must reach out to each other, let go of our selfish fears of those who don't think like we do and learn how to serve, protect and uplift one other.

It is that simple and that radical.

Timothy Naftali: Joe Biden's first challenge

Tim Naftali

President Trump lost his gamble that he could reject more than half of the country, upend every civilizing norm of the presidency, divert public goods to his person gain, undermine the professional ethos of the US government and, finally, deny the moral and public health implications of a pandemic and still win re-election.

Had Trump won, the American presidency would have changed for at least a generation. Many of the norms and laws that Trump resisted had emerged because of the bipartisan consensus after Watergate that imperial presidencies—White Houses that abuse power, abandon official and personal ethics and stifle dissent -- threaten all of us, regardless of political orientation. Had enough Americans across enough states rewarded Trump with a second term, Washington would have become irremediably, and for years to come, the corrupt swamp Trump assailed when he first took office.

This election seemed a lot closer than it was because of the central role played by absentee ballots in the outcome and the deliberate speed with which they were counted. As the final votes are counted, it appears likely that we will add new purple states to the list—Arizona and Georgia. It is a very healthy sign when presidential candidates have to fight harder for a state's support. It opens more doors to regional diversity and national compromises.

It is telling, though rare in US history, that in this election the President's party (which gained seats in Congress) fared better than the defeated incumbent. In a sense, Trump had negative coattails. Whether he intended to, or not, by harnessing the GOP as his personal vehicle, Trump changed it profoundly and created a sense of purpose that will outlast his presidency. If Trumpism, without Trump, can shed its bigotry, racism, hatred of science and nativism of its lame-duck leader, there could be avenues of cooperation ahead with Democrats and Independents worried about good-paying jobs, affordable health care for those with pre-existing conditions, climate change and racial injustice.

No matter what, the way forward will be tough. Throughout his presidency, Trump never admitted error and responded to majority disapproval by doubling down. We can expect this behavior to persist and anticipate efforts to obstruct and complicate the Constitutional transition of power. The stakes are unusually high right now.

Although not the first time America went to the polls amidst a national emergency, 2020 was arguably the first time that the two candidates did not share at least a general understanding of the nature of the crisis. The next few months will be critical to our ability to lower the human and economic costs of the pandemic. It won't be easy -- at least 70 million people endorsed with their vote the President's mishandling of the virus and many will be sympathetic to continuing efforts by Trump to sow doubt about the legitimacy of a Biden presidency.

Joe Biden's first challenge will be to begin the work of persuading some of these 70 million-plus Americans that for the sake of their country, let alone of their own families, they must accept that their real enemy is the virus --not the Biden/Harris coalition. With his years of experience successfully forging alliances, Biden is the right person for the job.

Melissa Gilbert: This country remembered its better angels

Melissa Gilbert

America has resoundingly chosen truth over lies, inclusion over exclusion, science over ignorance, faith over fear, compassion over cruelty, respect over ridicule, love over hate, substance over style, selflessness over self-dealing, freedom over oppression, unity over division and a global outlook over myopia.

We as a nation have an extraordinarily difficult task ahead. But I have every reason to believe that Americans will do what they have always done and come together to heal what has been broken over the past four years. We will come out the other end stronger, kinder and better than we were before.

We will persevere. It is what Americans have always done. We did it when we first landed on the shores of this great land. We have done this through the settling of our country, through wars, disasters and attacks from enemies -- both foreign and domestic. It is clear that America has chosen perseverance once again and I am filled with a tremendous sense of hope for the future of our country and our world.

Jeremi Suri: The reality is, the nation is slowly becoming more Democratic

Jeremi Suri

This election was not close, though it felt that way. We are a society deeply divided by race, party and region. The election exhibited those divisions, but the divisions are not equal. Although there are loud voices on both sides, the evidence shows that there are consistently more people who embrace Democratic positions on diversity and inclusion, rather than Republican resistance to these values. The vote was a brutal but necessary contest over who we are, and who we hope to be.

It was also predictable, despite many contrary polls. President-elect Biden won all the traditional Democratic states and the Democratic-leaning battlegrounds. President Trump won the traditional Republican states and the Republican-leaning ones. The only surprises, which did not decide the election, were Biden's strength in Georgia and Arizona, where Democratic Senate candidates also did well. Like nearly every Democratic presidential candidate since 1992, Biden won more votes nationwide. His electoral vote total will be close to 300, as it was for Obama in 2012.

Biden won an overwhelming Democratic majority in a deeply divided country with a Democratic majority distributed over a small number of states, and urban regions within still rural states. Trump held the large number of Republican states across the South and Mountain West, winning high totals from his stubbornly loyal base. But his base is millions short of a national majority. Even with an electoral system that favors rural areas, Republicans have a steep climb to win the Electoral College. Hillary Clinton's loss in 2016 reflected her unique unpopularity in upper midwestern Democratic states, but even there she barely lost.

The United States remains consistently divided by race, region and party. The Democrats are larger, more diverse and growing. Even with a skewed electoral system, the Democratic Party is gaining ground nationally, including in states like Georgia, Arizona and Texas. These gains are real, but slow and inconsistent.

The deliberate pace of change is frustrating, and it is hard to stay patient. We should, nonetheless, celebrate that in 2020 decency defeated demagoguery and love replaced some of the hate.

Brian Schaffner: American's racism, sexism and xenophobia shadow Biden's path forward

Brian Schaffner

Following Trump's surprising victory in 2016, a litany of studies convincingly showed that support for Trump was strongly driven by racism, sexism and xenophobia among large swaths of the American public. Once in office, Trump's policies and rhetoric only dumped more fuel on the fire, particularly by emboldening many of his supporters to openly express their prejudices in ways that they would not otherwise feel comfortable doing. These increasingly common expressions of hatred have brought our nation to a breaking point.

Biden's campaign was meant to be an answer to this divisiveness. His emphasis on restoring decency to the Oval Office was designed to make the election a referendum on Trump's prejudice-peddling politics. Many hoped that a resounding Biden victory would send a clear message that Americans would not tolerate politicians who so brazenly stoked the flames of racism, sexism and xenophobia. Instead, the fact that Biden could only muster a modest Electoral College victory is more a testament to just how divided our country remains when it comes to matters of racial and gender equality.

Whether President-elect Biden can do anything during the next four years to defuse these tensions is very much an open question.

Bambadjan Bamba: I'm a DACA recipient and this is my prayer

Bambadjan Bamba

The outcome of this election—a slow and steady count of votes that led to Joe Biden being declared the winner-- says that America in 2020 is still a country that abides by its constitution. It says that even though Americans are deeply divided, they endeavor to put their differences aside to follow a democratic process and avoid civil war and bloodshed. To me, this is why America still stands as a great nation.

If this election was the most consequential in the history of America, as some say, then I say that if we accept the election results peacefully, we will have passed a test.

The country of my birth, the Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire), also held controversial presidential elections recently. Just like the US, it appeared the most consequential election in its history. Ivory Coast's leading presidential candidates were both men of advanced age, and the country experienced partisan political deadlocks and racial and ethnic divisions. There was exasperation as political agendas and injustices led to civil unrest and many people died.

But instead of achieving our first peaceful democratic transition of power after more than 20 years of political crisis, the incumbent, who had already served his two-term limit, ignored the constitution to run for a third term. The country is again deadlocked and many fear another bloody civil war

It is through this lens that, despite President Donald Trump's contesting the outcome, I see hope in the 2020 US election. With tensions still high in both my countries, my prayer is that politicians act responsibly and respect the democratic process.

As one of the three million DREAMers who can't vote but whose life and future hung on the results of this election, I want to say a special thank you to all the Americans who empathized with our struggle, voted on our behalf and elected Joe Biden. It proves that America is still a place that welcomes immigrants. Now the work begins for humane immigration reform.

Vanessa Kerry: The reconciliation is just beginning

Vanessa Kerry

The 2020 election was a tense 100+ hour nail-biter to the White House. Many hoped that the outcome would be a moment of reckoning: a blue wave Biden victory to end a ""nightmare,"" or a Trump win—in effect and endorsement of a pattern of disruption. That it was so close speaks to how divided we are as a nation.

There is indeed a reckoning. Our divisions and challenges have been brewing for decades. With each subsequent administration in recent history, we have etched political polarization deeper, burying the possibility of meaningful reform and policy. It is into this abyss of damage that Joe Biden's administration will step.

The challenges are great. Covid is perhaps the biggest blockade to safe passage on the long road to recovery. Economically, we face a stubborn and growing wealth gap between America's richest and poorest families. It demands significant social policy and years to correct, all the more difficult when the roadmap required is longer than our election cycles. We face a reckoning with race and gender long avoided. Police have killed one black man or woman a week in 2020. These realities reflect structural inequalities and structural violence embedded over decades.

We can, however, build consensus again to address long term, intractable challenges and have conversations as one nation.

I'm an optimist because of lessons learned not at home, but in Africa. I have seen similar conundrums through my work to build access to better health and ultimately opportunity. It can happen. It requires patience, longer timelines and willingness to humbly adjust investments to be accountable.

We need this approach from our leaders - to value facts, lead with humility, own mistakes, course correct when required, and communicate both difficulties ahead and paths to progress.

But the American people have to meet them there. We need to embrace that the sequela, as we say in medicine--the condition resulting from our fractured history--will take time from which to recover. We need to recognize the lag in cause and effect of poor policies and acknowledge that our health, education and social support systems are weakened from layers of weak reforms and band-aid fixes. They will take authentic collaboration, patience and deep investment to revive.

The journey to reconciliation is just beginning.

Manisha Sinha: Be optimistic!

Manisha Sinha

Unlike many, I am optimistic about what the 2020 Presidential election tells us about our country. We live in a two-party system and Donald Trump was the nominee of the Republican Party that has stuck by him through thick and thin. The GOP today is willing to tolerate a culture of incompetence and corruption in the White House, foreign interference, racism, authoritarianism, and misogyny in a desperate ploy to hang on to power.

That Republican voters, so many of whom live in a disinformation echo chamber of right-wing Fox and radio talk show hosts and Q Anon conspiracy theories, should faithfully vote for someone like Trump comes as no surprise. After all, as Donald Trump-- who always says out loud what most Republicans think--said, he loves the poorly educated . Even as I write, Republican operatives under directions from the Trump family are trying to steal the elections through frivolous lawsuits and dangerous incitement of the more unhinged elements of their party.

But there is cause for celebration. That these forces, represented by a major political party, were defeated by a majority of American voters is perhaps one of the most important lessons of this election. Given the anti-democratic nature of the Electoral College, you might have missed this blue wave if you did not know where to look. The victory of the Biden-Harris ticket was not just a victory for the soul of America, as Biden puts it, but reflects the diverse and egalitarian state of our Union.

Kamala Harris' election as the first woman, as well as first African American and Indian American woman, to the Vice Presidency is particularly historic and bodes well for the future of American democracy.

W. Kamau Bell: America has a difficult question to answer now

W. Kamau Bell

The big question now is: Is America a democracy? Right now we are all still obsessed with vote counting. But we need to be obsessed with making sure everyone who wants to vote, gets to vote, and that their vote is counted.

But we all know that some of the leaders of the GOP do not want that to happen. Just look at Florida. Trump won the state with a comfortable lead of over 370,000 votes . But more than 750,000 people who were eligible to vote in Florida potentially weren't allowed to . These people are ex-felons whose voting rights were restored after Floridians passed Amendment 4 in 2018. But Florida's Republican-led legislature won't let them vote until they pay all their fines and fees associated with their convictions. This is effectively a poll tax.

I was taught in school that poll taxes are illegal. But then, I was also taught that a president declaring that there are high levels of voter fraud with zero evidence is a sign of an authoritarian government and not a democracy, but here we are. I'm not saying that all 750,000 of those people would have voted at all or that they would have voted for Joe Biden, but I'd take my chances. That sounds more like a democracy.

Until this country decides that more people with more access to voting is better than less people with less access, then as far as I'm concerned whether or not America is a democracy will remain an open question.

Piper Perabo: And now—make it easier to vote!

Piper Perabo

I'm so happy. This outcome is historic! The most votes in our nation's history-- let's celebrate! Elbow bump your neighbors and co-workers! And while we've got this team spirit, let's focus on the work we still have to do, so in the future every eligible American can vote. Mailing a ballot to every registered voter increases turnout, and shortens lines on Election Day. Can we do that in every state and territory? Many states this time had early voting--so helpful for basically everyone who doesn't have Tuesdays off!

Can we have two weeks of early voting, beginning everywhere on the same day? Could we design a more universal and easy-to-understand ballot? Could we have automatic eligible voter registration? Opt out if you want. Can we have enough accessible polling sites and ballot drop boxes, so no one waits on long lines--especially polling sites for Native American reservations? Can we have paper ballots and recurring security checks on our voting infrastructure? Can we restore the right to vote to every formerly incarcerated person?

And can we make DC a state? Can we assure American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands have voting members of Congress and can vote for President? Can we have an independent redistricting committee, so voting districts are never again drawn by political parties? And can we have campaign finance reform?

We can. It's already written into a bill called House Resolution 1 . On January 20, when the new Congress is sworn in, call your Congress person and both your Senators. Tell them you want H.R.1 to be a passed. This way the next election won't be so stressful, and maybe—just like on this joyful, historic occasion-- we can celebrate with hugs.

"Opinion: The 126 Republicans who signed on for 'an act of cynical, unpatriotic, undemocratic hypocrisy'","John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions at CNN.

(CNN) Republicans used to be the party of freedom, the party of President Abraham Lincoln. This week, 126 Republicans in Congress and 18 red state attorneys general decided to repudiate the legacy of Lincoln and freedom by endorsing Texas' ludicrous legal effort to overturn the election results. The good news is that the Supreme Court dismissed the case with no public dissents Friday night. The bad news is that a majority of congressional Republicans chose to support a demagogue over our democracy. It should not be forgotten or forgiven.

These 126 hyper-partisan politicians should now be known as members of the autocrat caucus. From Louisiana Rep. Ralph Abraham to New York Rep. Lee Zeldin, they added their names to this infamous list in a desperate attempt to overturn the election in four swing states won by Joe Biden. They decided to attack democracy itself when the results did not go their way.

Don't be fooled by whatever ornate excuses they make. This was not an attempt to find new evidence or even more absurdly ""defend the constitution"". It was objectively the opposite. Perhaps some of these 126 believed this a way to raise money from the base, insurance against a difficult partisan primary, or more to the point, insurance against an uncomfortable tweet from President Donald Trump. They surrendered their conscience and common sense because of fear and greed. Rarely have so many sold out their country for so little.

These chose to support a case based on false claims and lack of evidence. And it's particularly pathetic to see them do it for a weak and insecure lame duck President Trump, a would-be autocrat who's driving this nation to some kind of desperate reckoning based on nothing more than his own psychological inability to deal with the fact he lost an election and lost the ability to recognize reality as well. In most cases, that would be dismissed as a sad form of sickness that's incompatible with the power of the presidency, but these folks chose to trade their integrity to support Trump's delusion all the way up to the Supreme Court.

They followed the lead of the indicted Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a man who has been accused by his closest aides of bribery and abuse of power.

As conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg wrote with moral clarity in the Dispatch: ""It is an act of cynical, unpatriotic, undemocratic hypocrisy unrivaled in American history, a pure power play on behalf of a president whose disregard for the very Constitution these people have long claimed to adore is total. It is shameful. Infuriatingly shameful."" History will judge them as cowards and villains.

It should not be considered a profile in courage to oppose efforts to overturn a free and fair election. But the 70 congressional Republicans -- like Illinois Rep Adam Kinzinger, who had the courage to speak up for our democracy against partisan pressure -- should be honored as patriots.

If you're still not convinced, ask yourself how these 126 would act if a Democratic president made the same claims as Trump. Would any of them support or sympathize as a matter of principle? Of course not. They would denounce a Democrat who did this as a would-be tyrant. That's the big reveal: for them everything is secondary to partisanship and power. But the fact that no one is even trying to do this basic moral exercise rooted in the Golden Rule -- treat others as you would like to be treated -- speaks volumes about how we got here as a country.

It is the result of a long process of feeding hyper-partisanship for short-term political gain. It's a result of the war that Republicans have been waging against majority rule and demonizing Democrats as a way to justify any extreme actions they take.

A July 2020 study by Vanderbilt Professor Larry Bartels came to the disturbing conclusion that ""substantial numbers of Republicans endorse statements contemplating violations of key democratic norms, including respect for the law and for the outcomes of elections and eschewing the use of force in pursuit of political ends.""

When the GOP majority leader of the Pennsylvania state senate, Kim Ward was told about the congressional letter and asked if she would sign it, she explained to the New York Times, ""If I would say to you, 'I don't want to do it,' I'd get my house bombed tonight.""

This is not America. Or rather, it is Trump's America.

The creation of the autocrat caucus provides a bright dividing line. Good people can, of course, disagree about politics. But we are way beyond politics when it comes to an attempt to overturn an election without any credible evidence. The autocrat-inclined are not strong, but weak. They back authoritarian personalities and demonize dissent in the name of tribal loyalty. They have repudiated the legacy of Lincoln, who led our nation through a civil war to advance the principle that government ""of the people, for the people and by the people shall not perish from the earth.""",2020-12-13 00:00:00
Opinion: Where Joe Biden's moon rock came from,"Robin George Andrews ( @SquigglyVolcano ) is a volcanologist-turned-freelance science journalist, writing for The New York Times, Scientific American, National Geographic, The Atlantic and more. He is also the author of an upcoming book on volcanoes around the solar system. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN

(CNN) The day after the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Washington Post reported on the aesthetics of the newly redecorated Oval Office. Among all sorts of noteworthy items, a moon rock was found to be sitting on a bookshelf. Social media rejoiced at the sight, an indubitably cool artifact to find inside the White House. But what many didn't know was that this rock, dubbed Lunar Sample 76015,143, had been on an Odyssean journey to get there, one 3.9 billion years in the making.

The current thinking is that 4.5 billion years ago, a protoplanet the size of Mars slammed into a magma ocean-covered Earth. Debris from the baby planet and the spaceborne projectile was sent into orbit, eventually clumping together to make the moon.

The solar system was a bit like the inside of a pinball machine back then, with countless would-be worlds crashing into each other. Like the adolescent Earth, the youthful moon was a target too, with several enormous impacts carving out ginormous basins on its surface. And around 600 million years after it was formed, the moon rendezvoused with a rock the size of New Jersey, weighing about 25,000 trillion tons and moving at a speed of around 52,000 miles per hour.

This interloping giant rock, which hit the moon at an inclined angle, disintegrated upon impact, sending boulders shooting across the lunar surface, cutting deep, long grooves into the crust as if it were attacked by a cosmic, clawed beast. The impact would have been way more powerful than a gargantuan volcanic explosion like Mount St. Helens, which itself had unleashed more energy than the sum total of all the explosives used during World War II, including the two nuclear bombs. The rock carved out a circular chasm some 710 miles across. For the sake of comparison, the asteroid that careened into Earth 66 million years ago and heralded the end of the age of the dinosaurs excavated a pit a mere 110 miles in diameter.

Around 250 million years later, lava later poured into this great depression, forming a sea of molten rock named Mare Imbrium, the ""Sea of Rains."" And as lava lapped at the shores of this magnificent desolation, a curious rock sat nearby: a mangled amalgam of crushed sediment and once-molten matter, a product of the ferocity of that ancient, colossal impact.

For what seemed like an eternity, that rock sat silently on the moon, hit by the occasional micrometeorite. And 3.9 billion years after it was formed, in the twilight days of 1972, two visitors from another world, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt -- Schmitt was the first and only geologist sent to the moon -- saw it glinting in starlight.

The last two people to set foot on the moon carved off a chunk and brought a sample back home. Like the other rocks brought back by the Apollo missions, it was housed at the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. There, it was broken up, and its pieces -- including number 76015,143 -- were examined by scientists hoping to unravel the secrets of the moon's origins and its evolution, as well as providing them with a window into Earth's obfuscated distant past.

That we can host such stunning off-world geologic treasures on Earth and decode the epochal stories they tell without needing to invent time travel is a remarkable achievement. But Lunar Sample 76015,143 isn't sitting in any old building. It's in the office of the most powerful person in the world. That imbues this lithic archive with novel significance.

For the last four years, the Trump administration threw science into the sewers, treating it like an inconvenience at best and a shameful pursuit at worst. More than 400,000 Americans died of Covid-19 during Donald Trump's time in office . We may never know how many lives could have been saved had the former president not shown an allergic reaction to reality -- not only on the pandemic, but on another death-dealing existential crisis: climate change.

Biden is clearly ushering in a new era. Immediately after the inauguration, the new administration went to task, initiating their 198-page plan to defeat the pandemic while beginning the difficult work of stemming climate change. The Oval Office's moon rock is, for many, a cathartic sight, a symbol of the new President's science-driven agenda, of his administration's adherence to facts and to objective truths, something America needs now more than ever.

Landing astronauts on the moon was a political ambition first and foremost. But that rock, on loan from NASA at the request of the Biden administration, represents what can happen when a national priority is made of the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. If America can send people across the expanse and bring them back with geologic treasures, then it can also bring an end to a pandemic.

Ideally, this rock also represents a calling card to the stars. We can only comprehend our place in the cosmos if we go out and explore it -- and look not just to the moon, but beyond it. NASA is about to land its Perseverance rover on Mars, the first step in an 11-year operation to bring back the first pristine rocks from that planet's surface. One day, astronauts will be hauling Martian rocks home themselves. But who will be the first Earth-born emissaries to the Red Planet?

A future president of the United States may have a piece of Mars sitting on her bookshelf. If so, I suspect Americans will look back in pride at the moment they saw a moon rock sitting in Biden's Oval Office. It may mark the day the White House was exorcised of its ignorance, transforming once again -- and, we hope, forevermore -- into a place that champions science.",2021-01-26 00:00:00
My mom 'Obie' would have celebrated her birthday this week. She'd still be alive if Trump and Birx had done their jobs,"Fiana Garza Tulip is a Brooklyn-based communications lead at science and health startup, ZOE, and activist with Marked By COVID, a non-profit focused on uplifting the stories of those who have lost loved ones. A Texas native, she received degrees from UT Austin and the Parsons School of Design. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Just one year ago, I was sending videos of my then-seven-month-old daughter, Lua, to my mom in Texas. My daughter, husband and I were making the best of our extra time together in our one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. Lua was just starting to eat solid foods and she'd kick her legs up and down in excitement every time the spoon filled with pureed prunes approached her mouth. My mom would be filled with such joy every time she received a clip of her only grandchild -- the grandchild she wasn't sure she'd ever have.

In a CNN documentary that aired on Sunday night, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House's coronavirus task force under Donald Trump, said the former President's response to the virus caused hundreds of thousands to die. ""There were about 100,000 deaths that came from that original surge,"" she said . ""All of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially,"" she added, referring to almost 450,000 deaths.

My mom was 64 years young and had dreams of retiring at 65 so she could travel and spend more time with her family. She had been a respiratory therapist for nearly 30 years and her joints and muscles were in constant pain after being on her feet so much. Her job and financial needs limited her ability to take time off. So, I liked the idea of retirement for my mom, and I liked the idea of her spending more time with my daughter.

In June 2020, my mom told my cousin about a confrontation she had with a woman who was visiting a patient my mom was caring for. When asked to put on a mask, the woman said, ""If my president doesn't wear a mask, why should I?"" I believe that encounters like this -- and the complicit actions of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and then-President Trump -- played a role in Covid-19 spreading throughout my mother's hospital department soon after that. My mom died of the virus a few weeks later on July 4th.

In the middle of a Covid-19 surge, my husband, daughter and I drove 2,000 miles from New York to Brownsville, Texas, to attend my mom's memorial and burial. I wrote about that experience in a CNN op-ed last year.

What I didn't write about was how, at the same time as I was grieving my mother's loss, some members of my family were accusing me of insulting the administration, politicians and so-called experts by speaking out about their mishandling of the pandemic. Another close family member of mine, who showed up to my mom's funeral with Covid-19 and who was also a Covid-denier, told others that my mom didn't die of Covid-19 but, rather, from the bacteria she inhaled while wearing a mask all day.

With every new Covid-19 revelation, I think about that time and everything I lost as a result of the government's inaction and active denial of the devastation Covid-19 was causing. It played in my mind when it was revealed that Trump, as evident in his taped conversation with Bob Woodward, knew in early February that the virus was far more deadly than a severe flu, and that it was airborne and transmissible through community spread. He also knew we didn't have the stockpiles of personal protective equipment big enough to protect the public, let alone health care workers like my mom who was reusing her surgical masks for weeks on end. Instead of using the powers of his office to improve the situation, he chose to lie to the public, downplay the threat and ignore the warnings of the scientific community again and again.

Birx may feel anguish for not speaking out earlier but the reality is, she knew all of this, too. She was, in essence, a Trump enabler. Despite knowing about his malicious incompetence that was killing hundreds and thousands of Americans, the doctor talked to the press daily, lied by omission, and stood by while Covid-deniers in the White House derailed the response. Birx helped facilitate the Trump administration's campaign of disinformation by, at one point, granting him undeserving praise, going so far as to tout his comprehension of scientific literature

While her honesty provides clarity, it doesn't offer solace for those who lost loved ones during the past year. These preventable Covid-19 deaths happened on her watch. She was the White House pandemic coordinator. This was her job. She should be held responsible for not stepping up and doing the right thing while in power.

Birx's comments come across as an attempt to gain forgiveness for her silence and position herself as the victim. It seems she's trying to resuscitate her reputation by noting the lessons we learned from this monumental failure in government. But more than 550,000 Americans are dead and many more will die. There will never be justice for those who have died because of the decisions Trump has made and she let him make without publicly protesting. Her silence was inexcusable and learning how to do things better next time doesn't bring my mom back.

We are more than a year into this nightmare and people are still questioning science and public health guidance. People are still dying. Americans have been pushed into direct conflict, sometimes physical fights breaking out between those believing in science and facts versus those who thought their First Amendment rights were being taken away when asked to wear a mask and socially distance.

The lesson I learned is that Trump and his enablers are failed leaders whose behavior caused millions of people to die and suffer needlessly and that they should be held responsible.

I have no doubt that my mom, Isabelle Hilton Papadimitriou (""Obie""), and countless others would be alive today had then-President Trump and his administration put the interests of the American public ahead of his focus on reopening the economy so that he could strengthen his reelection bid . Birx confirmed in stark and no uncertain terms what was already the worst kept secret in Washington: The administration's pandemic response was riddled with dysfunction.

On April 1, my mom would have been celebrating her 65th birthday. This is the year my mom would have been looking forward to retirement. This is the year her dreams of spending more time with her family would have come true. Instead, we'll bake her favorite chocolate cake for an empty seat at the table and imagine her big, beautiful smile when we sing ""Happy Birthday"" to our forever hero.

When the history of the American pandemic is written, my daughter will ask how things got so bad. I will tell her that it was an age of failed leadership, a collapse of moral courage by those who should have spoken out, a distrust of science, and a time when people stopped caring for each other. I will make sure she knows that her grandmother, ""Abuelita Obie,"" deserved so much better and she should still be alive today.",2021-04-01 00:00:00
Mother of injured Capitol officer: What my son went through will leave an imprint on my mind forever,"Theresa J. Fanone retired as a senior family therapist. She worked with families affected by substance abuse, grief, trauma and domestic violence. She spends her time with her nine grandchildren, gardening and volunteering in the community. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Donald Trump recently said that his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 were ""hugging and kissing"" police officers and posed ""zero threat.""

My experience of that day, and every day since, has been significantly different.

My son, Michael Fanone , is a 20 year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Department, assigned to the First District. I knew there was a rally planned for Jan. 6. All leave had been canceled. This was to be an ""all hands on deck"" event. Michael was scheduled to work his regular shift but left for work early that day.

I had been listening and watching on television the speeches at Trump's ""Save America"" rally. More and more, my anxiety grew as I saw the enormous crowd and listened to the negativity and tone of the rhetoric expressed by all speakers. For me, it evoked fear and sounded like the speakers were advocating for a threatening confrontation.

Terror, horror, anger, fear and rage do not begin to capture the emotions I felt that day, wondering which police officer's face belonged to my son. I prayed --- for my son and all the sons, daughters, fathers and mothers who were present that day. Watching the beatings, suffering, fear and confusion on these officers' faces will leave an indelible imprint on my mind forever.

Opinion: Super Mario dies for a living,"According to Internet memes, Super Mario , the mustached video game plumber, was going to be dead the day after March 31. In other words, on April Fool's Day.

The rumors are of course wrong . Nintendo is just halting sales of a greatest-hits collection of Super Mario titles, and removing a special Mario game from its download store. That's not death: that's barely a vacation for Mario, who had five games release last year, plus more

There is one bit of irony about the rumors of Mario dying. Mario has perfected dying! He dies for a living! He eats and breathes dying!

Dying is easy: living is harder.

The special games were for Super Mario's anniversary: the dad bod hero has been running (and jumping) for the last 35 years. (More if you start the clock not with Super Mario Bros. in 1986 but Mario's debut Donkey Kong in 1981.)

In 1980, Nintendo was a Kyoto, Japan, toy company branching into the arcade game market. It planned a Popeye game tied into an upcoming film to break into the rich American marketplace, but its license was delayed.

First-time game designer Shigeru Miyamoto , now the unargued greatest game designer ever, rolled with the setback. He kept his Popeye premise -- small indefatigable hero vs a colossal enemy -- and designed new characters to fit his jumping-on-platforms gameplay.

In this picture taken on March 17, 2021, fans wear themed augmented reality goggles for the ""Mario Kart"" ride at Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka.

The human villain Bluto was reimagined as a garage-sized gorilla puzzlingly named Donkey Kong. Popeye, now with a hat and a dark mustache instead of spinach-built forearms, was called Jumpman. Donkey Kong was shipped to a Seattle-area warehouse, where thousands of unpopular Nintendo arcade cabinets were waiting to be rejiggered with a better game.

It was too late to rename Donkey Kong, but the American staff wanted a better name for its protagonist than ""Jumpman.""

The word ""Nintendo"" is usually translated to ""leave luck to heaven."" Before Nintendo made games and toys it made cards for gambling dens. That name reflected the philosophy of many gamblers: let the fates decide.

The fates, on that day Jumpman needed a new name, sent in a man named Mario who jumped up and down. Mario Segale was their landlord, and he was angry the upstart company was late on the rent. As Mario's feet struck the warehouse floor over and over, so did inspiration. Jumpman was discarded for Mario. (A few years later, Michael Jordan would become a different Jumpman.)

Donkey Kong made Nintendo hundreds of millions of dollars , and spawned spinoff games both for hero and villain. Nintendo's home console the NES launched nationwide in 1986 with Super Mario Bros. The rest is history: soon Mario's face was the next best thing to Santa Claus'.

A good time now is not the same as a good time in 1986: it's far easier now. Super Mario Odyssey, a 2017 release for the still-sold-out Nintendo Switch, features an ""Assist Mode"" where blue arrows point Mario in the right direction. If Mario simply stands still, he regains lost health. Compare this to original-recipe Super Mario Bros., whose tame first level nonetheless killed more Marios than Bowser (Mario's archrival, a fire-breathing turtle) ever did.

Modern Mario games are more about the experience than the challenge. What were blindfolded three-pointers are now Pop-a-Shots on a footstool. It's a different sort of fun, with cushioned guardrails instead of walking on hot coals.

What will Mario be like in another 35 years? Maybe even less interactive. Super Nintendo Land recently opened in Universal Studios Japan. The Mario Kart: Koopa's Challenge ride featured bleeding-edge augmented-reality technology , and you can shoot shells (turtle shells, of course, not ammunition shells) to rack up a high score. But the ride's route is pre-decided: you can't steer Mario's kart.

Rides and movies are great, but Mario is a game star first and foremost. The reason kids love Mario isn't because of who he is, no more than Mickey Mouse's success is due to kids' love of talking rodents. No, kids love Mario because they can become him. Picking up a controller is like yelling Shazam: now they're a full-sized adult, ready for all the extra life they can fit in before dinnertime.

No Mario? Thank God! he lives, and lives forever. A thousand deaths from now, nay, ten times ten thousand deaths from now, Mario will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.",2021-04-01 00:00:00
Witnesses make a devastating case against Derek Chauvin and a history of injustice (opinion),"Peniel E. Joseph is the Barbara Jordan chair in ethics and political values and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently, "" The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. "" The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) The trial of Derek Chauvin on second-degree murder charges in the killing of George Floyd has cast a bright spotlight, one that forces Americans to re-confront the police violence that helped trigger a transformative social movement. It also demands we pay attention to the deeper connections between this act of violence -- that so many of us are now reliving as we watch testimony unfold live -- and America's long and troubling history of racial injustice.

Collectively, the harrowing accounts of witnesses and bystanders who watched Floyd die offer tragically compelling evidence of state-sanctioned violence against Black bodies. What happened to him resembled a public execution, one that echoes for many the anti-Black lynchings that marked the Jim Crow era.

The trial of Derek Chauvin is giving a personal face to political arguments and theoretical abstractions. The prosecution, armed with an over 9-minute-long video of Chauvin's knee choking the life out of Floyd, has argued that this is a clear case of murder. Chauvin's defense attorney has countered that Floyd died as a result of preexisting medical issues and that Chauvin, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, followed department protocols. The defense has played on longstanding racial stereotypes in characterizing Floyd as an out-of-control Black man whose superhuman strength required four officers to subdue him.

The first two days of witness testimony offered excruciatingly poignant details about Floyd's death. The defense repeatedly tried to characterize Donald Williams II, a Black mixed martial arts fighter who witnessed the scene, as ""angry"" during cross examination. ""You were angry,"" defense attorney Eric Nelson, said at one point . ""No, you can't paint me out as angry. I was in a position that I had to be in control,"" responded Williams.

Nelson's efforts to discredit Williams, who at one point was moved to tears in describing the horrific nature of Floyd's death, sought to undermine the justifiable emotions -- from anger to grief to rage -- of Black folk who have experienced these emotions far too often.

In video footage, Williams could be heard repeatedly excoriating officers, at times using harsh language, as Floyd's life slipped away in full view of an increasingly stunned crowd. Defense efforts to blame the crowd as a contributing factor in Floyd's death, causing a distraction to Chauvin and the other officers on the scene, are appalling.

Genevieve Hansen, a firefighter and EMT who happened upon the scene while taking a walk, testified that she repeatedly offered assistance to Floyd but her pleas were denied . ""I was desperate to give help,"" Hansen recalled in emotional testimony. Hansen broke down in tears describing her feelings of ""distress"" at being unable to help Floyd as he lay critically injured.

Of the six witnesses called on Tuesday, the most powerful words were spoken by those too young to appear on camera. Three high schoolers and a 9-year old recounted witnessing Floyd's death . Darnella Frazier, who has been previously identified as recording the most widely known bystander video, testified that she recognized her own father, cousin, and family members in Floyd's visage.

That an innocent child, teenagers and well-meaning bystanders had to bear witness to his death -- including a firefighter with training that might have saved Floyd's life -- is truly extraordinary. For Black America however, there is nothing particularly unusual about Floyd's death, with the exception of the national response in its aftermath.

Charles McMillian, a Black witness testifying on the trial's third day, broke down in tears during his testimony. He seemed to relive the horrors of that day in real time. ""I feel helpless,"" McMillian tearfully observed after witnessing police body cam footage of Floyd's arrest.

His emotional testimony visibly moved those in court, prompting the judge to call for a recess. Before that, McMillian recalled his mother's death, emphasizing how those who saw Floyd's death saw him as human and included him in the wider moral circle of their own lives, something Derek Chauvin was unable or unwilling to do.

What might be characterized as the Chauvin Defense continues a long and cruelly American tradition of devaluing Black life. This argument rests on the proposition that Black defendants and ordinary citizens are inherently guilty of whatever a White person alleges.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the videotaped police beating of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King. The acquittal of the officers by a Simi Valley jury the next year sparked urban rebellion in Los Angeles, just as the deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray led to civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri , and Baltimore in 2014 and 2015. Those latter uprisings were part of the political and cultural ferment of the Black Lives Matter Movement, which argued that police killing of Black people represented a gateway to a panoramic system of injustice.

I'm left thinking of "" To Kill a Mockingbird ,"" Harper Lee's iconic portrait of racial gaslighting and White supremacy. The institutional racism that grotesquely deformed the criminal justice system in Lee's time continues, despite major opposition and resistance, in our own. Lee's enduring achievement lay in signaling to the reader that ideals of citizenship and dignity imbued in the American Dream were on trial alongside Tom Robinson. In Minneapolis, decades of history are on trial alongside Derek Chauvin.

The Chauvin trial illustrates how the replaying of trauma can also produce the potential for catharsis. Those witnesses shedding tears over George Floyd's senseless death were also mourning for themselves. A just society does not put first responders in the position of watching a man's life slip away, nor does it force children to witness the same. These scenes of trauma and violence, so often depersonalized in our national culture, have the power to reshape the social fabric of the entire nation.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Opinion: The delightful vacation you can take from your chair,"(CNN) In California the tulips and irises have come, the gutter is throaty with rain, and the dawn air is sweet. I don't know about you, but I am already fantasizing about some small vacation.

It's been a terrible year, and we need to heal, and it's easy to feel exhausted and also wayward, to want to get out and find some place to savor the air. Admit it: The inner school kid in you (especially the one who has been stuck home for more than a year) would rather be out playing: maybe with music, maybe with friends, maybe with mud, maybe with words.

Tess Taylor

Maybe you just want to find a good bench to sit on, with a book. You long for a little more time to daydream. You try to steal five more minutes outside at lunchtime. You want to close your eyes in the sun. That's OK: It's been many months of brutal duties. We all want to feel the life inside our lives. We all long to be set free of what is dutiful.

Perhaps that's what makes now such a good time for National Poetry Month, and why it's a good thing to take some time this year -- of all years -- to savor it. For those of us who love poetry, poetry offers just that -- time to play; time to daydream, a bit of word music, time off from what's rote. Even on busy days, reading just one poem can seem to create a bit more internal space, a way to stretch time, just as the daylight time lengthens in spring.

Hence, in April — a month devoted to poetry. Never mind that the poet TS Eliot wrote that ""April is the cruelest month/ breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing/ memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain."" April is a time,\ where, cruelly or kindly, a lot of organizations that don't always talk about poetry find a way to stick a poem somewhere, and a few more newspapers review poetry, and many poets read and launch books.",2021-04-01 00:00:00
Opinion: Lil Nas X isn't worshipping the devil. He's healing deep hurt,"His music video for "" Montero (Call Me By Your Name) ,"" which shows the rapper giving a CGI Satan a lap dance and killing him, went viral.

Meanwhile, high-profile pastors are referring to him as a thug and accusing him of Satan worship. The governor of South Dakota tweeted Bible verses at him . A Black conservative, who once pretended to be a Georgia elector, implied the singer's soul was in peril, tweeting ""hell is hot."" It seems that some conservatives, many of whom famously whine about ""cancel culture,"" are trying to cancel the musician.

Lil Nas X, who was born Montero Lamar Hill, is remaining unapologetic on Twitter. From his reactions to the outrage, it's clear that he isn't afraid of your hell. As Jean-Paul Sartre wrote in the iconic play ""No Exit"": ""Hell is other people.""

Among many recent tweets, X wrote on March 27, ""i spent my entire teenage years hating myself because of the s--t y'all preached would happen to me because i was gay. so i hope u are mad, stay mad, feel the same anger you teach us to have towards ourselves.""

Still from Lil Nas X's music video of ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name)""

This tweet speaks volumes for millions of queer folks, especially Black queer people, who have suffered spiritual and theological violence at the hand of church doctrines. X's words are ones the late, great James Baldwin -- who once wrote, ""Because I was born in a Christian culture, I never considered myself to be totally a free human being"" -- would admire and support.

Like Baldwin, Lil Nas X is insisting on being totally free. He is turning the devil's mirror on everyone who told him to hate himself. He is refusing to wallow in the ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" trope, and he is shedding light on the literal hell the people in his community have been put through. For many queer folks, especially youth, hell is right here on Earth, in churches, schoolyards and homes.

The real hell is forged by institutions that oppress and shame, the people in power who uphold those institutions, the people who keep queer youth in spiritual and mental bondage, from the homophobic preacher to the corrupt politician. Sartre was right: Hell is other people.

Hate disguised as Scripture is one reason why so many Black queer youth are suicidal . There is blood on the hands of many churches and social conservatives. Lil Nas X is using his platform to say, ""no more.""

Still from Lil Nas X's music video of ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name)""

If you are a person who follows Christian religious dogma, you know the devil cannot be killed -- not even a devil from a CGI pop imagination. It's rather amusing that people are more offended by Lil Nas X writhing around in red cornrows than actual evil that harms people every day.

Accusations that Lil Nas X is promoting Satan worship are laughable. Artists playing with religious imagery is nothing new, from Judas Priest to Madonna to Marilyn Manson to DMX -- DMX and Marilyn Manson even partnered on a 1998 song called ""The Omen (Damien II),"" which included the lyrics ""Here we are on our way to hell / We're gonna do it, and we do it well."" Rather than hurt their careers, these provocateurs became even more famous for blaspheming against the church.

Until recently, it was unheard of for a Black queer artist to be as successful as Lil Nas X. Disco singer Sylvester and Jermaine Stewart, who sang 1986's ""We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off,"" were immensely talented but suffered severe career consequences due to their sexuality. Once upon a time, just a rumor an artist -- especially a Black artist -- was gay could ruin their career.

Conventional approaches to commercial viability mandate that Lil Nas X is not supposed to be this Black, this gay and this unapologetic. And yet, he is.

Are the music video and shoes Satanic? Does it matter? Lil Nas X has never publicly declared himself a Christian.

As a result, Lil Nas X's video has only exposed demons in other people. He is a Black queer man dismantling a cycle of shame. While people are calling him blasphemous, he's providing healing for those who admire him. That said, if your God is contingent upon a 21-year-old's music video or a pair of shoes, then your God may not be as almighty as you believe.",2021-03-30 00:00:00
"Opinion: A reporter's tin-eared tweet was a test, and USA Today failed it","(CNN) Journalist Hemal Jhaveri recently sent an ill-advised, ill-considered tweet during a particularly emotional moment -- not long after one shooter committed a massacre in three spas in Georgia and another killed 10 people in a Colorado grocery store. That's not why she's no longer a race and inclusion editor for USA Today's Sports Media Group. It's because her employer, like too many people today, gave into their own cowardice.

In a Medium piece announcing that she had been fired, she detailed the ways she and many other journalists of color feel treated in many newsrooms throughout the country. We are expected to ignore or accept everyday microaggressions and watch White colleagues express themselves in ways we don't always feel free to. Then, when we speak up, we are called to account for making them uncomfortable.

All the while, we know we are often targeted by readers and audience members who don't like us for our race or gender but attack us in ways that obscure that reality. After Jhaveri posted her story, USA Today told CNN that it wouldn't comment on personnel issues but ""we firmly believe in and stand by our principles of diversity and inclusion.""

This isn't about one journalist or one tweet. Neither is this solely about decisions made by large media companies. It's about whether we will allow bad-faith actors to dictate what justice for a public mistake looks like. It's an issue that can affect us all. But this isn't about online mobs, not really. If you really want to understand supposed ""cancel culture,"" that nebulous term which has been thrown around with great fanfare, particularly on the right and among libertarians, you shouldn't waste your time trying to determine just what offenses are most likely to get you ""canceled."" You should spend more time checking the spine of the organization whose employee is under relentless attack. In the case of Jhaveri, USA Today looks spineless.

Jhaveri's tweet was tin-eared. It overly generalized a complex and horrific phenomenon -- mass shootings -- and unfairly targeted a group in a heated moment. There's no excuse for it.

""It's always an angry white man. Always,"" Jhaveri's tweet read. (Mass shooters are not always White men even if the majority are, if you needed reminding.) When the alleged shooter was identified as Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, a Muslim man of Syrian descent, Jhaveri was inundated with messages about the need to ""muzzle"" her, that she hates White men and Christians, and is a racist race baiter, among many other things.

Most of us who frequent Twitter have found ourselves caught up in an emotional knee jerk reaction, only to realize later we've taken things a bit too far. I know I have. Some of the people I respect most have as well. The combination of frustration and the ability to respond publicly almost immediately to just about any event is a dangerous one even for the most careful person. That's one reason why Twitter exists. The site tends to incentivize speed and superficiality rather than critical thinking and reward pithiness over nuance. It's not that critical thinking isn't possible on the platform, it's just that social media users must exercise a daunting level of caution and expend extra effort to remember that when a high-profile story is unfolding.

In a sane world, depending on the circumstance, deleting the tweet, apologizing and absorbing a well-earned round of harsh criticism is consequence enough for a journalist in Jhaveri's position. In rare cases, a short suspension might even be warranted. But this isn't a sane world, especially not the world of social media, where hundreds or thousands of people are ready to pounce on any misstep by a perceived ideological enemy.

I've been subject to such pile-ons when the right people eagerly expressed their disagreement with something I had written. It's not fun. I play in public, so I expect the public to sometimes not like what I say. Every public figure should expect the same. It's up to the person under fire, and their employer, to ensure that such a pile-on doesn't become an injustice. And that's where USA Today went astray.

Jhaveri's tweet was among a bevy of such tweets by journalists and other public figures prematurely claiming the shooter in Colorado was a White man after early images of the half-naked suspect with a bloody leg and in handcuffs circulated on social media. Americans' racial identities are complex -- far more so than US Census definitions might suggest, for instance. Controversially , they classify many of Middle Eastern descent as White . How to best address and reflect the nuances of racial identity is a question that certainly merits deep scrutiny; ultimately, however, what matters here is that there was simply not enough information available at the time to determine whether the alleged perpetrator's race played a significant role in his motivation to commit such a horrific act.

But was that assumption so egregious it should have ended with Jhaveri losing her job? Of course not. Was her overgeneralization about mass shooters so beyond the pale USA Today should have ceded ground to a group of people online who cynically use any such mistake to defame those with whom they disagree? Of course not.

That's why ""cancel culture"" discussions should stop being about those trying to get someone punished for a perceived (or real) slight. They aren't going away. Social media has given more people more power than ever. In some cases, that's been extremely helpful, outing police officers who engage in police brutality and teachers and announcers at high school girls' basketball games who throw around racist slurs then blame it on diabetes . It's good those kinds of things are documented and shared far and wide. We need to see them, need to know them. It has given voice to the previously voiceless.

Even a good thing can every now and again be weaponized in disturbing ways, though. That's unfortunate. But that's why those in charge of making the decisions should be held to a higher standard, should be expected to not give into their own cowardice just to make an uncomfortable news cycle disappear as quickly as possible. USA Today failed that test. Horribly.

Other companies better find their spine, or they'll fail their tests, too. More importantly, how all of us respond in moments like these will help shape the contours of the discussion going forward. A society-wide spiral of cowardice serves none of us well. We can make it easier for companies to find their spines by showing ours first.",2021-03-30 00:00:00

Growing up attending American international schools around the world, I got used to teachers struggling with my name. There was always the awkward moment on the first day of school during attendance check when a new teacher got to my name on their student list and had to pause before reading it out loud with hesitation.

As a kid, I felt lucky that because I was born in Spain and of the Catholic faith, I had another name, a Western name: Fermín. So, it became routine that as soon as a new teacher was about to get to my name, I would quickly say, ""You can call me Fermín."" If they still struggled with pronouncing the Spanish ""r"" and the accent on the ""i,"" I would say, ""Just go with Fermin (pronounced the American way)."" I did not realize until a class on race and gender in college that I had been making myself smaller for the comfort of others.

Kuan-lin F. Liu

When I joined the workforce, I decided that I would go by Kuan-lin. Even though I worked at an English-language newspaper, all my bylines bore my Chinese name and so did my CVs. This small detail was my way of saying that I am proud to be Asian, even though I would still find myself telling people I met in person that they can call me Fermín if they want. Most people would ask me what I prefer, but during an interview at the Hong Kong branch of an American company, something else happened.

I was meeting with a hiring manager, a middle-aged White man, to discuss potentially joining his team. Though we had previously met and corresponded via email, he did not remember my name, nor did I expect him to since it was recruitment season and he had probably met with dozens of candidates by that point. At the start of the interview, he looked down at my CV for a quick reference so he could address me. He looked up and after an attempt at my name asked, ""Is there another name you go by?"" Naturally, I said, ""You can call me Fermín."" His response was ""We're going to have to come up with an easier name for you. How about we call you Fred?""

I am ashamed to say that I did not immediately ask to leave the meeting. Instead, I chuckled awkwardly and tried to move the conversation forward by focusing on the nature of the job. After being offered the job, I turned it down. Needless to say, I could not imagine working with someone who could not be bothered to learn my name because what he was really telling me was that he did not care about who I was as a person.

Opinion: Beverly Cleary's Ramona is a force for all us beautiful pests,"Allison Hope is a writer whose work has been featured by The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Slate and elsewhere. The views expressed here are the author's. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) The first time I realized that I preferred to wear bruised knees under long, athletic shorts -- and not skirts and dresses -- I was in third grade. I liked soccer, hated ballet and wasn't afraid to speak my mind, even if it was to an adult. Some might have considered me a pest.

Allison Hope

The summer after third grade, long, hot, school-free days loomed ahead -- I had no camp or planned activities. Relief came in the form of the summer reading program at the local library, where the air-conditioning slapped my sun-stroked face and books lifted me to other dimensions. I read and read and it was my form of travel, a portal into what life might offer beyond my little world.

That was the summer I met Ramona Quimby, the heroine of ""Beezus and Ramona,"" ""Ramona the Pest,"" ""Ramona the Brave"" and others in a series of novels that author Beverly Cleary, who passed away Thursday , created for a character spun out of her earlier ""Henry Huggins"" books.

Cleary's was a long and rich life, but it is also true that a part of Cleary will live forever -- because her words endure in the millions of girls-turned-adults who carry her brilliant words with us. The follies and triumphs of that ""pest"" of a girl Ramona are woven into the fabric of our own senses of self and place in the world. Cleary helped to shape the coming of age of so many for decades, and for that, we owe her a debt of gratitude -- and a permanent place on our bookshelves.

Cleary's timeless protagonist, Ramona, was a girl who felt so intimately familiar that there were times when I could no longer separate the character in the well-worn pages of the library book from the real-live me. She was my age and had scraggly long brown hair like mine. She wore her heart on her sleeve. She also wore baggy clothes and didn't care about the girlie things the characters in other books or TV shows always seemed to talk about. She felt real.

Opinion: Why the first state vaccine pass isn't ready for prime time,"Dr. Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) In a bid to facilitate the reopening of businesses, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced that a digital Excelsior Pass would be available free of charge to all New Yorkers wishing to reveal accurate Covid-19 information about themselves in return for admission to places like Madison Square Garden.

At first glance, the idea makes sense — this is more or less like the proof-of-age ID long used to allow (or not) youngish-looking people to order alcohol in bars and restaurants. One hopes, of course, that Excelsior Pass (named after the single-word New York State motto, ""Excelsior"" ) is less prone to counterfeit than the screen-at-the-door system for bars and pubs.

But like so many back to normal ""tout de suite"" ideas, including those favored by some red state governors that are intended to dig the country out of the pandemic rut, the Excelsior plan likely will cause more problems than it solves.

Some of this is due to bad science, some to perpetuation of health care inequality, and some is that right now, just as the latest Covid-19 surge has begun to rear its ugly head in the US, it sends the exact wrong message about the still-present threat of Covid-19.

To test drive the goods, I signed up for the Excelsior Pass, the first of its kind in the nation. It extracts data from New York state on vaccine status and recent PCR or antigen tests, and can be completed in about 30 seconds if you don't read all of the information about disclosure and confidentiality.

If you are someone who reads the fine print, you may be scared off. With a few simple questions — date of birth, name, then a pop quiz of sorts, asking you what vaccine you received along with where and when — New York state figures out who you are and verifies your information in the blink of an eye. Although the app comes with all sorts of assurances about patient confidentiality, Big Brother-phobes will possibly prefer to delete and move on.

Assuming, though, that the urge to get to a Mets game outweighs trepidation about too many people knowing too much about you, the bigger issue is the one large scientific mistake the Excelsior-developers have made. They want one of three medical facts about you: When your vaccination series was completed (logical), or when your last negative PCR molecular test was completed (also logical), or when your last negative antigen test was completed (uh-oh).

Inclusion of the very mediocre 15-minute antigen test (once referred to as the ""rapid antigen test"") is a gigantic mistake. It is widely used by many walk-in medical clinics and has been shown to be just fine to use for someone who is ill and might have Covid-19.

However, for those with no symptoms — the worried well — CDC research suggests it is no better than a coin toss for diagnosis of actually infected people in the early pre-symptom-but-contagious phase of infection. And this is exactly the worst group to not diagnose. They feel great! And relieved to be antigen-(false) negative! And are so happy to hang out with friends instead of following up with the recommended PCR test if their 15-minute test came back negative. All the better to spread coronavirus.

Second, Covid-19 infection has revealed many aspects of health care inequality in the United States, including substantial impact by race and by income on infection, mortality and most recently, vaccination rates. Excelsior does offer the option of printing out a pass, but an app designed for cellphones and those looking to spend a few bucks at a ball game or a restaurant will likely be used more heavily by the affluent, giving them mobility and peace-of-mind not available to health care have-nots.

It's true that our vaccination history already is ascertained at various points along the way. Children entering and continuing school must show proof of several vaccinations. Colleges require vaccinations. Perhaps then the fancy, futuristic app is not the best way to share this information but rather a standard ""proof of vaccination"" already used in countless situations. Paper, ink, a pediatrician's illegible handwriting — this has served us well for many years.

Finally, any move predicated on the notion that we are near the end of the pandemic certainly is nice but has substantial risk. Right now the coast is not clear. It ain't over till it's over and it ain't over. The danger of a ""pass"" — Excelsior or otherwise — likely will be construed by some as a signal that the all-clear has been given and the threat has passed.

Yes, a ""pass"" may be great for business and businesses, but it will cause harm to human health. Deference to strictly financial measures or to the collective eagerness to resume a less-constrained daily life must be held in abeyance, however miserable it feels now, until the population is better vaccinated. As the latest rise in cases in the US is demonstrating, though we wish otherwise, we simply are not there yet. So too with Excelsior Pass.

A suggestion to Gov. Cuomo: I'll pass for now but perhaps let's try this one again in mid-May.",2021-03-29 00:00:00
"Opinion: I got vaccinated -- but my family can't, and the guilt is killing me","Melissa Mahtani is a senior producer and reporter for CNN's live news team. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Vaccine guilt is a real thing -- and although it may not make sense rationally, emotions aren't rational. Last Saturday, I got the Moderna vaccine against Covid-19. I had been eligible to get it under New York City guidelines due to underlying conditions. However, I wasn't planning on it.

Melissa Mahtani

I do have underlying conditions, but I've been able to manage them and I'm very aware that there are others out there -- teachers, health care workers, those over 60 -- who need it more than I do. As more and more of those types of people did get vaccinated, I was still planning on waiting until everyone could get the shot and was hopeful that my family in Zambia would also be able to get their doses at that time.

What spurred me to get the shot was the loss of one of our closest family friends last month, who I consider my uncle. Originally from Yorkshire, England, he had lived in Zambia -- like many other expats in the former British colony -- for most of his life. When he got coronavirus, even being around 80 years old couldn't secure him a spot in an overcrowded hospital, so he was turned away. That led to him having a stroke and eventually being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) where he lived out his final days, on a ventilator.

Had he been in England, or any other rich nation, he likely would have received treatment immediately, or got the vaccine, and would possibly still be alive today. The tragedy was made worse by the fact that his family and friends couldn't say goodbye in person due to him having Covid -- like countless others around the world who have been robbed of real goodbyes to their loved ones.

Losing him was hard. The reality that this could be my parents, and I wouldn't be able to see them or say goodbye if they got the virus, was worse. Thousands of miles away, would the last time I had seen them be the absolute last? That haunting thought made me realize that I needed to take the vaccine that was offered to me here, so I could be one step closer to being able to see my parents if disaster struck. But still, I felt racked with guilt over being eligible to take it when they, who need it more than I do due to their age and more severe underlying conditions, could not.",2021-03-29 00:00:00
Opinion: I work at a Texas coffee shop. This is what it's been like trying to enforce our mask policy,"Emma Andrews is a graduate student in Texas State University's MFA Poetry program. As a native Texan, she has lived and worked in the Austin area all her life. The views expressed here are hers. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) ""So, you discriminate against people with health issues?"" the maskless man said loudly, as if he was in a packed arena and not a coffee shop. The other customers looked away, backed up or retreated into the next room. I took a deep breath, trying to keep my voice steady and calm.

""No, we don't discriminate,"" I said firmly, ""but we require documentation for the said health issue or we require you to sit outside or at a table to order. We can't have you walking around the coffee shop without a mask if you do not have documentation.""

He sneered, rolled his eyes. ""If I call your manager right now, will he say the same thing?"" he said, smirking, as if he highly doubted that I knew what I was talking about.

""Yes,"" I said without hesitating, staring right back into his patronizing gaze. I turned back to the espresso machine to finish the latte I was working on. My co-worker and I exchanged a look that said, we don't get paid enough for this.

The man lolled off. It seemed that all he had wanted was a scene. But my stomach still churned.

Confrontations like this one have become more frequent and more severe since March 10, 2021, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's executive order to rescind the statewide mask mandate went into effect. Having read the executive order, I am confident that legally, our business can still require customers and employees to wear masks as we have been doing for the last year. In the order, Abbott explicitly states , ""Nothing in this executive order precludes businesses or other establishments from requiring employees or customers to follow additional hygiene measures, including the wearing of a face covering."" However, this is no guarantee that every patron has read and understood the executive order, or that they will respect each business' mask policy.

The coffee shop where I work started to require our customers to wear masks when sitting inside and when ordering about a year ago. While the majority of our customers have been happy to comply with the rule, it's amazing to me how many people still roll their eyes or make snide comments when we ask them to put on their masks. Though they comply with wearing a face-covering, a few wear their noses out, or pull up the collars of their shirts, or wear thin scarves or bandannas. Some customers wear masks into the store but pull them down and lean over the counter (into my face) to order their drinks.

Many of my fellow Texans have adopted a lax attitude towards safety precautions. This indifference, while troubling, is not explicitly aggressive. Generally, those with this mindset comply with our business's rules. They hold their own beliefs while respecting the health and safety of others.

Their attitude differs from those who have been told, by politicians, the media, or the internet, that being required to wear a mask infringes on their rights and that Covid-19 has been blown out of proportion by liberal politicians and media. These are the people who come into the coffee shop with no intention of wearing a mask, despite our rule, and who verbally attack us when we tell them that they need a mask or that they need to wear it properly.

JUST WATCHED Restaurant owner targeted by vandals after CNN interview Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Restaurant owner targeted by vandals after CNN interview 03:00

These customers bear a resemblance to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz when he refused to put on a mask at a press conference . Cruz stated, incorrectly, that he was following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and that having been immunized meant that he did not need to wear a mask. These justifications are simply untrue and the public animosity that Cruz showed toward the reporter who asked him nicely to put on a mask shows Texans that to be ""with Cruz"" means to refuse to wear a mask. The petty politicizing of a simple, affordable, and life-saving piece of cloth is putting Texans at risk and fueling public displays of hatred.

Abbott's framing of the March 10 executive order has played into the polarity incited by those who view refusing to wear a mask as a political statement. While the order protects the rights of businesses to require masks, it has been largely misunderstood and misrepresented to mean that Texans will no longer have to wear masks anywhere for any reason.

The press release from the governor's office is titled, "" Governor Abbott Lifts Mask Mandate, Opens Texas 100 Percent ."" Without reading this press release or the executive order itself, some Texans assume that this title means that they should no longer be required to wear masks in businesses and that being asked to do so is infringing on their rights. This makes mask policies difficult and treacherous to enforce, even if they are the legal right of each business.

While it's all fine and dandy for the governor to trust people to ""take the actions that they have already mastered"" to keep themselves safe, it's not fair that many of us in the service industry are getting paid minimum wage to be exposed not only to illness, but also to rage and violence that comes with trying to enforce a mask policy post March 10.

Being a young woman who often works with even younger women, I have felt extremely unsafe when confronting grown men about our mask policy, especially after experiencing and witnessing brutal verbal attacks.

About a week after the March 10th order went into effect, I was working a closing shift with two other young women. A man came in with a mask on but pulled it down to order. My 18-year-old coworker asked him nicely to keep his mask up. He pulled the mask down farther, and she asked him again. He went off the rails: ""I am a 40-year-old man, I can scratch my nose if I want to. Give me your manager's phone number. I don't think he's going to be impressed with your attitude. I was going to give a tip to you and your friends, but your attitude just lost it."" And on and on until he finally left.

My co-workers and I were shaken. If we had asked him to leave, he might have gotten more agitated. If my other co-worker or I had stepped in, he might have seen it as a threat and the situation might have escalated. We had heard about violent, even fatal attacks on customer service workers who were trying to enforce mask policies. Despite all the signage on our doors and our manager's policy to not serve those without masks, we still had to sweetly listen while this man berated a young woman less than half his age who is working to pay her way through college. We felt completely helpless.

While leaving the decision up to businesses and ""individuals"" sounds like a very Texan way to handle a global health crisis, it's not protecting Texans.",2021-03-29 00:00:00
Opinion: Sports world should boycott Georgia over racist voting law,"Terence Moore is an Atlanta-based national sports columnist and commentator. He's a CNN sports contributor and a visiting professor of journalism at Miami University in Ohio. Follow him on Twitter @TMooresports and subscribe to his YouTube channel . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Gov. Brian Kemp and a slew of Georgia Republican lawmakers sped a sweeping election bill into a Jim-Crow-like law Thursday, imposing new voting restrictions in the battleground state. The law, wrongfully dubbed The Election Integrity Act of 2021, is a poorly disguised attack against the state's minorities following President Joe Biden's victory last November.

So, sports leagues with teams in Georgia should go back to the future, emulating the time when they stopped giving cities and states huge events (Super Bowls, Final Fours and league All-Star Games) that stimulate the local economy, even before political wokeness became a thing.

As for the bill's lowlights, these two measures standout:

New identification requirements for absentee voters, despite reports that more than 200,000 Georgia voters lack a driver's license or state ID number. This measure will push voters to scramble to show proof of identity through other means like a utility bill, bank statement, passport, among others. Nationally, 25% of Black Americans lack government-issued photo ID, compared to only 8% of Whites.

Under the new law, giving food and water to those waiting in line to vote is now illegal. This may discourage Black Georgia voters, who historically wait in longer lines than non-minorities and often in hot weather.

As activists and leaders grapple with these actions, industries and groups including the sports world can join the fight.

Atlanta likes getting sports stuff.

Just stop giving Atlanta sports stuff.

Why Atlanta? Well, Georgia Republican lawmakers know the state's whole economy begins and ends with Atlanta, home of the state capital and the main target of these voter suppression laws since voters in predominately Black counties around Atlanta, such as Fulton and Clayton, did much to elect Georgia's first Black senator (Raphael Warnock) and first Jewish senator (Jon Ossoff).

We can start by stripping Atlanta of Major League Baseball's All-Star Game, which is set to take place in the city in July.

Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark told the Boston Globe Friday that he ""would look forward"" to discussing moving the game from Georgia. Sound familiar? In 2017, the National Basketball Association moved its own All-Star Game from Charlotte, North Carolina, in response to the state's HB2 law. The ""bathroom bill"" required people at a government-run facility to use bathrooms and locker rooms that corresponded to the gender on their birth certificate, if the rooms in question were multiple-occupancy, and drew criticism for its discriminatory nature against the LGBTQ community. The law was repealed later that year.

Not only that, but if Georgia keeps its new voting law, the National Black Justice Coalition urged the Professional Golf Association Tour to keep major tournaments out of Georgia, starting with next week's Masters Tournament.

Good.

We need more of that.

In addition, Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia Republican lawmakers should consider this: In February 2020, Miami hosted the last Super Bowl with full attendance before the Covid pandemic and, according to that area's Super Bowl Host Committee, the event had an overall $571.9 million impact on South Florida.

So, if you're, say, Atlanta, you don't want to lose a Super Bowl, not after hosting three of them and wanting a bunch more. You also don't want to lose the 16 metro Atlanta-based companies in the US Fortune 500 list . You don't want to lose conventions, trade shows, major film production companies and anything else of national or international stature, especially if the leaders of those industries say they'll refuse to enter your city or state limits while you continue to embrace racism.

According to the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau, the city had nearly 47 million visitors in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, and that translated into a $16 billion hospitality industry for the area.

Are you listening, Georgia Republican leaders?

Until you and your supporters realize the 19th century was so two centuries ago, everybody, from Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola in corporate America to the headquarters of the National Football League and Major League Soccer around various sports leagues, should boycott the state of Georgia in general -- and Atlanta in particular.

Give them nothing.

Treat Atlanta and Georgia the way the NFL did Arizona during the early 1990s, when the league yanked a Super Bowl away from the state after its citizens voted not to support the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, even though it was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. Treat Georgia like the National Collegiate Athletic Association does to all of those states refusing to remove anything resembling the Confederate flag as their state flag, like they did last year in Mississippi.

Treat Atlanta and Georgia like they haven't a clue until the overwhelming majority of politicians and voters for both of those places realize Confederate leader Robert E. Lee has been dead for 151 years and policies like the ones they've enacted don't have a place in our society.

This bill is more like Georgia leading the way for more than 40 other states to do what this one just did.

That is, Georgia Republican politicians gave the blueprint for their counterparts elsewhere to spit on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by disenfranchising Black voters.

"Opinion: A year on, the 'Color of Covid' still matters","Catherine Powell ( @ProfCatherine ) is a professor of law at Fordham University School of Law and adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. The views expressed here belong to the author. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Now that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are more than halfway through their first one hundred days in office, their leadership demonstrates what a difference two months makes. In addressing the linked health and economic crises, the Biden administration is tackling both the global Covid-19 pandemic and related pressing domestic challenges.

And yet Biden can do more to combat our interconnected pandemics of race and gender inequality and Covid-19. If this is a New Deal-like moment , the recovery should draw on the positive aspects of that era, but must not repeat its shortcomings (given that President Franklin D. Roosevelt's policies excluded the predominantly Black domestic and farm work sectors from labor protections established in that era).

I coined the term "" Color of Covid "" in an CNN op-ed published last year to think critically about the race and gender justice paradoxes the pandemic unmasks. Black and Latinx Americans are overrepresented among both front line workers and among the unemployed.

Women, especially of color, face a similar duality -- what I call the "" Gender of Covid ."" On the one hand, women are overrepresented in essential work. And as part of the invisible labor force that keeps the economy afloat, they continue to face deep gender (intersected by race) pay gaps and are underrepresented in management as well as other leadership and more visible roles across the economy.

Biden has already taken substantial steps to advance twin health and economic recoveries.

In terms of the health crisis, during his first presidential news conference on Thursday, Biden set a new goal of reaching 200 million vaccinations by his 100th day in office --doubling his original goal.

Earlier this month, he announced a major boost in his vaccine rollout, teeing up enough doses to inoculate all K-12 teachers, staff and childcare providers by the end of March and all adults by the end of May. In his first prime-time address from the White House — marking the grim one-year anniversary of the pandemic — Biden also projected a potential return to relative normalcy by July 4th if we continue social distancing and wearing masks.

Promising news. However, at the time of writing, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker , nearly 70% of those who are fully vaccinated in the United States are White, while only 7.2% are Black, 7.4% Latinx, 4% Asian, 1.6% American Indian/Alaska Native, .2% native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific Islander, and 10.6% identifying as ""multiple/other.""

To help counter this, discussion about vaccine hesitancy should be reframed as one on institutional trustworthiness, given the racist history of medical experimentation on Black Americans (for example, in the Tuskegee Study ) as well as the history (and contemporary reality) of unequal health care access. Furthermore, since White Americans are typically more affluent, have access to higher quality education, and have greater access to reliable WiFi and transportation, many have been able to better navigate the complex online vaccine schedule systems -- even filling up appointment slots in Black and Latino neighborhoods.

Given the digital divide, localities must ramp up creative ways to reach and prioritize under-served communities, even more so now that Biden has announced his goal of universal vaccine access, which may either intensify or ameliorate race disparities in distribution. And Blacks aren't the only group whose hesitancy must be overcome; Republicans (as a group) report the highest rate of vaccine hesitancy, based on politically-inspired misinformation.

The Biden administration might expand work with trusted community leaders to overcome concerns based on deficiencies in institutional trustworthiness and misinformation campaigns (for example, campaigns aimed at science denialism). Further, state, local, tribal governments, and territorial public health departments could use funding from Biden's American Rescue Plan to support teams of trained individuals to provide vaccines through door-to-door and mobile units programs—targeting older, more vulnerable and at-risk individuals.

On the economic recovery front, in addition to supporting vaccine distribution, Biden's first major legislative achievement, the American Rescue Plan , extends federal unemployment benefits; provides an additional $1,400 stimulus check to those earning modest incomes; and expands the child tax credit up to $3,600 per year (projected to cut child poverty in half and reduce poverty overall by one-third). The final bill represents one of the most significant plans to address economic precarity (along with President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act) since the Great Depression.

In 2017, then-President Donald J. Trump signed a very different $1.5 trillion economic package into law. Whereas Trump's tax cuts disproportionately padded the pockets of the very wealthy, the American Rescue Plan reduces the tax burden on all Americans except the top 1% of earners.

Looking forward, the Biden administration should take additional steps to address the race and gender structural inequalities that the pandemic unmasked. The executive orders the President has recently issued on race and gender equity are laudable first steps. Beyond this, Biden needs to re-imagine the future of work

With more Americans working remotely -- a trend likely to continue even after the pandemic -- Biden's ""build back better"" policies should be designed to support access to STEM education for women and people of color and to equip them with skills for jobs in the digital economy, where they are underrepresented . This is particularly pressing, given that displacement due to automation disproportionately affects these same groups. Beyond tech jobs, green jobs will become increasingly significant (because of climate change) and need to be made more equitable. According to a 2019 Brookings report, ""Fewer than 20 percent of workers in the clean energy production and energy efficiency sectors are women, while black workers fill less than ten percent of these sectors' jobs.""

Further, because of race disparities among those able to telecommute , Biden should continue to build on his initial steps to strengthening Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) protections for all workers, including front line, essential workers. Specifically, the Biden administration should go beyond issuing an emergency temporary standard (essentially emergency safety rules) for Covid-19 to ensuring adequate funding for OSHA to investigate and enforce such standards long term.

Importantly, as Ai-jen Poo and Heather McCulloch note, another critical sector for the future of work includes the care economy -- made up mostly by women of color -- given the need to care not only children but aging baby boomers. Just as the physical infrastructure of roads, bridges and tunnels connects workers to jobs, so too the human infrastructure of the care industry serves as a bridge for others like working parents, who rely on nannies and caregivers for their children. Because these jobs enable other people to do their jobs, the National Domestic Workers Alliance is gaining support, calling on Biden and other lawmakers to adopt a National Bill of Rights for Domestic Workers , which would apply federal labor laws to these workers.",2021-03-26 00:00:00
Opinion: One of the most important trials America has ever seen is about to start,"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) We have a jury in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, charged with the May 2020 killing of George Floyd. Now we stand on the precipice of one of the most important trials this country has ever seen.

Anybody who tells you they know for sure what any jury will do has never tried a case. Juries are, after all, collections of human beings, and we humans are nothing if not mercurial. The uncertainty becomes even more pronounced in a case involving the police. Multiply it again when the case involves race.

While there is no way to predict how the Chauvin jury ultimately will decide, to this point the pretrial criminal justice process has held up well. Judge Peter Cahill and the parties have done their jobs, setting the stage for the jurors to do theirs.

Most importantly, Judge Cahill wisely denied multiple defense motions to move the case out of Hennepin County (where Minneapolis is located). Chauvin's defense team first tried this tack before jury selection began, and the judge denied it

Then, when news broke during jury selection that the city of Minneapolis had reached a civil settlement with Floyd's family for $27 million, the defense raised the issue again. The judge, again, refused to move the trial.

The defense argued that publicity around the case generally (and then the settlement, specifically) would compromise Chauvin's right to a fair jury trial in Hennepin County. Judge Cahill sensibly concluded that ""I don't think there's any place in the state of Minnesota that has not been subjected to extreme amounts of publicity on this case.""

A transfer of the case out of Hennepin County would have been disastrous both for the trial itself and for public faith in the trial's fundamental fairness. Any such transfer would have resulted in the case being tried in a different county than where the charged crime occurred, which in itself would raise questions about fairness.

And, critically, a transfer would ensure a less racially diverse jury pool.

Hennepin County is Minnesota's most populous county , and also has the highest percentage of African American residents, about 13.6%. Only one other Minnesota county has above 10% African American population, and 47 counties are below 1% . To move the trial would all but ensure a jury comprised of fewer African Americans than in Hennepin County, and a verdict from such a jury could lack legitimacy in the eyes of the general public.

As it turns out, the Chauvin jury is actually substantially more racially diverse than the population of Hennepin County itself. Of the 15 jurors (including three who will serve only as alternates), nine are White, four are Black and two are mixed race, according to the jurors' self-identifications in court.

The jury's diversity is a good thing. Imagine the opposite scenario, where the Chauvin jury was substantially less racially diverse than Hennepin County and included only one, or even zero, Black jurors. The public would justifiably question the jury selection process, and an acquittal from such a jury would be difficult to accept as legitimate.

Now that the jury is seated, the prosecution will present its case first and must satisfy its burden to prove the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. We've likely already seen Exhibit A for the prosecution: the bystander video of Chauvin pinning his body weight through his knee on Floyd's neck, while Floyd was handcuffed, for eight minutes and 46 seconds.

This video, on its own, should go far toward the prosecution's ultimate goal: establishing that Chauvin intentionally assaulted Floyd, resulting in his death (to prove the charged second-degree murder ), acted with ""depraved mind, without regard for human life"" (to prove the charged third-degree murder ) or acted negligently (to prove second-degree manslaughter ). The jury ultimately can choose to convict or acquit Chauvin on all, some or none of these charges.

Expect also to hear from some of the bystander eyewitnesses, and the independent medical examiner hired by Floyd's family who concluded that Floyd's death was a homicide caused by ""asphyxiation from sustained pressure."" (The Hennepin County medical examiner who conducted the autopsy also found that the cause of death was homicide, but he determined that Floyd died not because of asphyxiation but rather because of, essentially, a heart attack brought on by Chauvin's actions: ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression"").

We almost certainly will not hear from Chauvin or the other three charged former officers, all of whom can invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination to avoid testifying.

As straightforward as the prosecution's case might be at first glance -- almost a ""just hit play on the tape"" kind of case, as prosecutors sometimes say -- rest assured, Chauvin's defense will put up a fight.

First, expect the defense to argue that Chauvin did not cause Floyd's death. The defense may look to exploit the aforementioned differences in the opinions of medical examiners, though both conclude that Chauvin's actions contribute to or caused Floyd's death in some manner.

The defense also may argue that Floyd in fact died of a drug overdose. Toxicology reports show that Floyd had both methamphetamines and fentanyl in his blood at the time of his death. And Judge Cahill has ruled that the defense can offer limited evidence of a 2019 arrest during which Floyd purportedly swallowed drugs during a police encounter; the defense may argue that Floyd did the same when Chauvin encountered him in 2020.

The defense also may claim that Chauvin's actions were necessary to physically restrain Floyd and take him into custody. Some surveillance video evidence appears to show Floyd at least temporarily struggling with police officers at the scene. This is a risky tack for the defense, however, because the relevant question is not whether Floyd ever struggled with police officers, but whether Chauvin used excessive force when, after he already had Floyd rear-handcuffed and face-down on the ground, he pinned his knee to Floyd's neck for over eight minutes.

Opening arguments start Monday. Thus far, the jury trial process has worked as designed. The outcome is anything but certain, and the stakes -- for the entire country -- are enormous.

Now, your questions

Patrick (Oregon): Could federal criminal charges still be filed against the officers involved in the death of George Floyd?

Yes. The Justice Department reportedly has convened a grand jury to investigate Chauvin, and could bring federal charges for deprivation of civil rights under color of law -- meaning, essentially, that Chauvin, while exercising his official power, intentionally and knowingly deprived Floyd of life and liberty. In 2019, the US Supreme Court upheld the ""separate sovereigns"" doctrine, which established that there is no legal bar to both federal and state prosecutors charging the same person for the same conduct.

So the Justice Department can charge Chauvin if it sees fit, even though Chauvin already faces charges from Minnesota state prosecutors. As a practical matter, the Justice Department likely will wait to see the state jury's verdict in the Chauvin trial before deciding whether to bring separate federal charges.

Hilda (Nevada): Could prosecutors have charged Chauvin with first-degree murder?

As discussed above, Minnesota prosecutors have charged Chauvin with various second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. A first-degree murder charge would have been difficult, though not impossible, for prosecutors to sustain.

Under Minnesota law, first-degree murder must be both intentional and premeditated. Regarding intentionality, Minnesota prosecutors have not alleged in the current second-degree murder charge that Chauvin intentionally killed Floyd, but rather that he intentionally assaulted Floyd, resulting in Floyd's death.

Obviously, it is easier to prove intent to assault than intent to kill.

Regarding the premeditation element of first-degree murder, the law does not specify any particular time requirement. There's a common perception that premeditation requires careful planning, well in advance, like a group of mobsters might carefully plot out an orchestrated hit. While that type of plotting certainly would qualify as premeditation, the law does not require such careful or methodical premeditation.

The argument for premeditation is that, at some point during the eight-plus minutes when Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck -- during which Floyd stated ""I can't breathe"" and ""Don't kill me"" -- Chauvin had to have become fully aware that he was about to kill Floyd.

Yet Chauvin, knowing what his actions would do, made a decision to continue kneeling on Floyd's neck. But Minnesota prosecutors have taken a more conservative approach and have not charged a first-degree murder, which is arguably more difficult to prove than a second-degree charge.",2021-03-26 00:00:00

(CNN) The stretch of Grand Avenue where Onesimo Garcia works in Brooklyn is not exactly grand. It's a desolate warehouse street, in the shadow of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, where cars roar overhead. There's a monolithic self-storage place on one end of the block and a trio of empty warehouses on the other, waiting to be demolished. It's a street where film crews like to stage scenes of drug deals going down. It has that look — all grit and graffiti. But there's also a tiny garden, growing in a square of dirt carved out of the sidewalk, where sunflowers and roses bloom in the summer.

That's all Garcia.

He's the superintendent — the ""super"" — of a crumbling warehouse that dates back to the early 20th century, when it was a garment factory. Today, the place is an apartment building, housing painters, musicians and performance artists, all in industrial lofts. Garcia has been working here for decades. When he first arrived in the 1980s, the building housed a sweatshop, packed with hundreds of immigrants stitching together clothing for retailers. Back then, he told me, he worked in the shipping department, boxing up the clothes.

Over the years, he has dealt with all kinds of drama in the building. There were the tenants who set fires on the floor of their apartment to stay warm, the woman who built a warren of tiny rooms in her loft and scrawled poetry across the walls, the guy who let his dog use the roof as a toilet. ""People are crazy,"" he said to me, shaking his head.

But none of it could have prepared him for the way his life would change because of the coronavirus.

As the virus quietly seeped into New York City early last year, Garcia was doing his job as usual, handling people's trash and packages, fixing the ever-broken elevator, entering apartments to help tenants deal with faulty water heaters and clogged sinks. During this time, misinformation swirled around the virus. President Donald Trump said it would simply disappear . The Surgeon General said the flu was a bigger concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it wasn't necessary to wear masks for protection.

In March, the truth slammed into focus: The virus was rapidly spreading across New York, destined to kill tens of thousands. Suddenly, nonessential businesses had to close their doors. People needed to start working from home. Hospitals faced the fact that they could run out of lifesaving equipment. New York was on its way to becoming the epicenter of the pandemic.

And with that, the city that never sleeps experienced one of the most extraordinary moments in its history: It was told to shut down.

But not everyone had the luxury of staying home. An army of essential but unappreciated workers had to continue doing their jobs so that the city could function amid the unprecedented crisis. Bus drivers, delivery people, sanitation workers, grocery clerks, hospital janitors, doormen. They risked their lives so others could stay safe, as did essential workers across the country.

Garcia, among them. His is the story of America, and the increasingly dire plight of our workers who keep it running. It's time to listen. As Congress fights with itself over the minimum wage and how to help families in need, it's time to ask ourselves: What does America owe its essential workers? What do we owe the people who have risked their lives to keep the country alive amid this deadly crisis? And where will they be — mentally, physically, financially — when the pandemic is over?

When the city closed down last March, Garcia knew he would have to keep going to work. He needed to support his family — his wife and two sons at home in Brooklyn, as well as his father, sister, and two nephews in Mexico. But he feared for his safety every time he walked into the building. ""For me to come to work every morning, I feel so afraid something will happen to me,"" he told me, noting that the virus has been especially deadly for Latino people like him

His first move was to pull out a clump of N95 masks he had once bought for construction work. Even though health experts at this point were saying masks weren't necessary, he thought it would be a good idea to wear one. After all, there was a highly contagious virus in the air. Why not wear a mask? Then he ordered a bunch of paper masks online from China. While awaiting the shipment, he said, ""I started wearing one N95 mask a week. You're not really supposed to wear them more than once, but I only had eight of them, so I cleaned them off with alcohol and let them sit in the sun.""

At work, he tried to limit his direct exposure to people as much as possible, for everyone's safety. ""I told people, whatever's happening in your apartment, if it's not an emergency, I can't go in. Most people understood."" He worried about bringing the virus home to his wife and two sons. He established a routine to try to keep everyone safe at home, promptly shedding his clothes each day after work and tossing them into a black plastic bag, then taking a shower and putting on clean clothes before greeting his family.

And then, one day in April, his wife, Matilde, felt sick after coming home from work at a corporate cafeteria. ""She had a bad fever and cough, but she didn't want to go to the hospital because she knew people were dying there,"" Garcia recalled. Indeed, thousands of people had died across New York at this point, with new infections skyrocketing. Doctors and nurses were rapidly using up stocks of protective gear.

As Matilde's symptoms worsened over the next two days, Garcia convinced her to go to an urgent care clinic in Manhattan to get tested. He went with her and waited outside the clinic, as instructed. Back home, while the couple awaited the test results, their 26-year-old son, Christian, fell sick as well. So Garcia took him to the clinic for a test too.

A few days later, the results came in: Both Matilde and Christian had the virus.

The warehouse on Grand Avenue hasn't changed much since its factory days, despite the changing face of its tenants. Its windows are so old, it's hard to see through them, thanks to the cloudy bubbled glass and chicken wire. Garcia has done his best to take care of the place, and its residents, for decades. He tends to his little garden out front, despite the fact that someone stole a pot of roses as soon as he planted them. He puts pumpkins out on the stoop at Halloween, and hangs a wreath on the front door at Christmas. He fields complaints about the overworked washing machines and the clanking, lurching elevator, which likes to leave people trapped between floors.

I know the elevator well because I lived in the building for a time with my brother, Jesse, who still lives there. Over the years, Garcia told us his story. I remember laughing with him one day when he helped me attach an absurd metal pan to the ceiling to catch drips, so rain wouldn't plop on my head in the kitchen. He began telling me about his journey to America.

Garcia first arrived at the warehouse when he was a teen. The eighth of nine siblings, he had grown up in a poor family in Puebla, Mexico, where his parents served as cooks for a French family. He came to America as an ambitious 18-year-old, with hopes of earning some money to go to college back home in Mexico.

He thought he might work in construction in New York City, as an uncle and older brother did. But getting there wasn't easy. In February 1985, he boarded a bus in Mexico City, along with a brother and sister, and headed to Tijuana, traveling ""two days and two nights,"" he recalled, on the dusty, rusting bus. His older brother had arranged for a man in Tijuana to help the three siblings get across the border, making a down payment to secure the man's help. The plan was for Garcia and his siblings to pay the rest after getting jobs in America.

The three siblings were told where to meet the man on the street one afternoon in Tijuana, with instructions not to get close to him or talk to him, but to follow him from a distance. They did so, hiking out of the city and up a steep hill late into the evening. Then, they waited. ""It was dark out, nine or ten at night,"" Garcia remembered. ""He told us to run when the patrols disappeared."" Indeed, the border agents eventually left, and everyone ran like mad, scrambling for the border. ""We ran for thirty, forty minutes,"" he said. They made it across the border into California, where they were hustled into a car. A driver spirited them away to San Diego.

There, they boarded a plane bound for New York City, increasing their debt to the man. Airports were a new experience for the family. ""We didn't speak English,"" Garcia said. ""They just told us to look for an 'Exit' sign when we landed in New York.""

In New York, they found a yellow cab and headed to their uncle's apartment in Brooklyn. ""It was snowing so bad,"" Garcia told me. ""We had no proper clothing for the snow.""

When they arrived at their uncle's place, they stood out front, shivering for hours as they waited for him to return from work.

It was the beginning of a rude new reality of life in America.

Garcia got a job in the garment factory and began working there 13 hours a day, boxing up the clothes in the shipping department. He worked seven days a week — Sundays to Fridays at the factory, then Saturdays in a restaurant in midtown Manhattan, washing dishes. He earned around $120 a week, he said, and he had a huge debt to pay to the man who helped him get from Mexico to New York. He had other expenses too: he lived with his uncle, so he needed to help pay the rent, in addition to sending money back home to Mexico for his mother, who had recently fallen ill. Suddenly his college dreams seemed further away than ever.

""Back in Mexico, when people used to talk about New York, it sounded like a fantasy to me,"" he said. ""When I came here, I saw things differently. But I had no choice; I had to stay and finish paying the people I owed. I couldn't return home.""

And so he slaved away in the factory on Grand Avenue, which was teeth-chatteringly cold in the winter, with frigid air seeping in through cracks in the windows. Summers weren't much better, when the sun beat down on the black tar roof, roasting the un-air-conditioned building and everyone in it.

When he was 19, Garcia met his wife, Matilde, at the factory, where her job was to put labels on sweaters. They fell in love and later married. She was a US citizen, thanks to an immigration-reform bill that President Ronald Reagan had signed into law in 1986. The law, which imposed penalties on employers who hired undocumented workers, also made immigrants who had entered the country before 1982 eligible for amnesty. Matilde sought amnesty and became a citizen. After the couple married, Garcia became a citizen too.

He kept working away on Grand Avenue, even though the job provided low wages, no benefits, no sick leave, no savings plan and no paid vacation. But Garcia had no choice but to keep working. He needed the job, especially when his wife gave birth to two boys, Christian and Juan.

Eventually the factory shut down, the building got divided into apartments and he became the super. In typical Garcia style, he added creative touches to the lofts when he could, like hanging a vintage chandelier with fringe lampshades he had found abandoned in a corner of the factory. The building got sold, then sold again. He kept taking care of the place.

He set a goal of helping his sons get to college one day, hoping they could achieve the dream that he had not.

When Matilde and Christian tested positive for the virus, they hunkered down in separate bedrooms to quarantine for two weeks, as directed by the health care workers at the clinic. ""They were told to stay home, and if they couldn't breathe, to go to the emergency room,"" Onesimo said. ""Everyone was wearing a mask inside the apartment. It was so scary."" Indeed, bodies were piling up across the city, with refrigerated trucks parked outside the hospitals to handle the overflow. Ambulance sirens wailed around the clock.

Amid the spiraling tragedy, mixed messages from officials continued, with the President continuing to claim the virus would disappear. The CDC reversed course on its earlier advice, now recommending that people wear masks. For many essential workers, that advice came too late, with bus drivers among the hardest hit.

Garcia and his 22-year-old son, Juan, became caretakers, delivering Tylenol and soup to Matilde and Christian, while trying to keep their distance from their loved ones in their own home. Matilde was harder hit than Christian, suffering a dangerously high fever and cough. There were times she became so delirious from fever, Garcia said, ""she was talking to herself."" The family wondered if she should go to the hospital, but she remained reluctant. Going to the hospital, where she would be surrounded by dying people, felt terrifying, and she wouldn't be able to see her family, as visitors weren't allowed. People were dying alone, without a chance to say goodbye to their spouses, parents or children. Since Matilde was still able to breathe, she stayed home.

As for Garcia, he couldn't afford to stop working, despite the crisis at home. He soldiered on, wearing a mask and gloves as he tried his best to stay away from everyone, both at work and at home. His wife received pay for sick leave and the family had health insurance through her work, so for the time being, they felt they could survive.

Around a week later, Matilde's fever broke. ""One day I saw her and she had no more fever; I was so relieved,"" Garcia recalled. ""She was looking better and I said, 'Oh my god, thank god.' I know people who had died from it."" Christian also cleared the virus and Garcia tested negative, twice. They thought they could move forward.

But then, another blow: Matilde got laid off. The corporate cafeteria where she worked no longer needed her services because the employees of the company were working from home. With the loss of that job, the family lost its health insurance. Garcia kept working and scrambled to find a family health insurance plan he could afford.

He and his family now have hardly any savings, due to decades of low pay. ""I was never able to save much for retirement,"" he told me. ""I've worked 35 years in this building, with no 401(k), no nothing.""

The pandemic has exposed the complete lack of a safety net for workers like Garcia — and the glaring inequity that America will be struggling with socially and politically for years to come. Long after the virus, the inequality hangover will remain. More than ever, these workers will be at the mercy of their employers, if they don't lose their jobs altogether. Many will experience a singular kind of post-traumatic stress from serving on the front lines.

Despite it all, Garcia has managed to achieve one dream: getting his boys educated. It's a testament to his resilience, and his strength. With the help of financial aid, Christian graduated from college with honors; Juan attended college for a year and plans to finish up at a trade school while he saves money from working at a gym. Garcia hopes they will have a better future than the one he sees for himself in America.

He, like so many essential workers across America, lives on a knife edge.",2021-03-06 00:00:00
Opinion: Harry and Meghan expose palace hypocrisy,"Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She tweets @HolstaT . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news

(CNN) If you've ever pondered the merits of going into business with your husband's grandmother, the events of the last week may have given you pause.

On Wednesday, Buckingham Palace announced that it was launching an investigation into accusations that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, bullied three employees within the royal household. The move came after The Times in the UK published a report citing sources that said Meghan drove two assistants out of her Kensington Palace household and undermined the confidence of a third staff member. Buckingham Palace said it was ""very concerned"" about the claims, made public just a few days ahead of the broadcast of Meghan and Prince Harry's much-anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey on Sunday -- and just after a clip was released of Meghan telling Oprah that ""The Firm"" was ""perpetuating falsehoods"" against her.

After the investigation was announced, Meghan's spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened by this latest attack on her character,"" and a spokesperson for the Sussexes dismissed the Times report as ""a calculated smear campaign.""

Though full details of the allegations against Meghan are as yet unknown, the palace's eagerness to respond to them stands in stark contrast to its previous reactions to other controversies, most notably the substantially more serious complaints against the Queen's third child, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. These statements have been minimal, and resolutely supportive of the prince -- not to mention an illuminating insight into the values the family seems to hold most dear.

Andrew stepped down from royal duties in November 2019, after his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein became a national embarrassment. Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, has said she was forced to have sex with the prince three times , including one occasion when she was underage (Andrew denies having any kind of relationship). His retreat as a working royal followed a disastrous BBC interview the same month, during which Prince Andrew described his friendship with Epstein, including the prince's inviting Epstein with his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell to Sandringham and Windsor, and staying with him at his house in New York after Epstein's release from prison in 2009 (and after Epstein had pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution with a minor). Andrew said in the interview that he still didn't regret his friendship with Epstein, even in light of the deluge of new allegations and evidence.

After a video of the prince inside Epstein's New York house in 2010 was published by the Daily Mail in 2019, the palace gave a short response , saying that ""the Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes.""

The prince was also for many years friends with Maxwell , who is currently in jail and awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges (to which she has pleaded not guilty) in New York. In July 2020, it was reported by the UK-based Daily Telegraph that in 2002, Maxwell had apparently sat on the Queen's throne during a private tour of Buckingham Palace organized by the Duke of York. As CNN reported at the time, Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the photograph, as did a spokesperson for Prince Andrew. Asked by the BBC whether Maxwell would speak about the duke as part of the ongoing investigation into Epstein, former investment banker Laura Goldman, a friend of Maxwell's, said: ""She has always told me she would never, ever say anything about him.""

Andrew's connection with alleged sex traffickers and allegations that he was involved in their crimes are far from the only marks against his name. At the end of November 2019, the Mail On Sunday reported that while the Duke of York was serving as Britain's trade envoy, a taxpayer-funded position, he allegedly used official trips to promote a private bank. The palace's vague response outlined the prince's duties in the role, concluding that it ""was to promote Britain and British interests overseas, not the interests of individuals."" The Prince stood back from the position in 2010, after his friendship with Epstein came to light -- but did not step back from his broader royal duties until 2019, after his dire BBC interview

There was no public indication that the prince had been forced out -- he was allowed to retire in what was described as ""a personal decision,"" taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles.

Though the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew has been incredibly serious, the palace has yet to release any statement which undermines his position as a supported member of the family. Everything is calculated to minimize embarrassment -- famously a priority for his mother, the Queen.

A consistent theme of royal faux pas, until the recent rift with the Sussexes, is that of a muted response from both the head of the family, and the royal households -- always brief, and calculated to diminish the story. When Prince Harry was snapped dressed as a Nazi at a party in 2005, Clarence House, the London home of his father the Prince of Wales, issued a swift apology on his behalf.

Now, apparently no longer enjoying the stalwart support of his family, and perhaps feeling the effects amidst the current media storm, Harry drew a comparison with the past experience of his mother, Princess Diana, in a clip from the Oprah interview released last week . ""I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here ... with my wife by my side,"" he says. ""Because I can't believe what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself, all those years ago."" It's not the first time the prince has made a connection between the treatment of Meghan and Diana -- particularly in terms of the media's hounding of his mother prior to her death.

Queen Elizabeth herself, still a popular public figure , has likely remained so in part due to her taciturn approach to public relations over the years -- which, with the notable exception of her much-disparaged silence following Princess Diana's death, has rarely steered her awry. Though a public servant, and an annual recipient of the taxpayer-funded sovereign grant -- valued at $107.1 million (£82.2 million) in 2019, she has only ever given one sit-down interview in her 69-year reign.

The values considered most dear by the Queen and the palace consistently appear to be loyalty, and a willingness to toe the royal line. In an uncomfortable exchange in late February after the palace stripped Prince Harry of his military titles, the palace said it was ""not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service."" Harry served in the armed forces for 10 years, including two tours to Afghanistan -- credits apparently less valuable than that of ""senior royal."" The Sussexes responded swiftly to the palace, with their own statement saying: ""We can all live a life of service.""

The sense that unwavering dedication to the crown is the only proper course for anyone connected to the royal family is amplified by the British media, which tends to over-egg the population's fervor for the royals. When Meghan released a photograph announcing her second pregnancy, there was a broadly positive response, but she was also greeted with some cruel backlash in light of her recent abscondence. The gibes apparently disregarded the need of a woman irrevocably in the public eye, who had recently suffered a miscarriage, to control the narrative around her own pregnancy.

On Sunday, the Sussexes' full interview with Oprah aired and generated many more headlines -- and questions -- on the theme of their credibility or otherwise. While many of these may be valid, they should be substantially less interesting to the institution the couple has left behind than the questions surrounding the senior royal still nestled in its bosom. As long as Prince Andrew enjoys the unwavering protection of the palace, its forays into the alleged past behavior of Meghan Markle will continue to ring hollow.",2021-03-06 00:00:00
Opinion: Americans are hitting the road. 'Nomadland' goes along for the ride,"Sara Stewart is a film and culture writer who lives in western Pennsylvania. The views expressed here are solely the author's own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Millions of American jobs have been lost due to the pandemic - and a lot of those positions likely aren't coming back. People are losing their homes. What happens next?

The highly anticipated film "" Nomadland ,"" out Friday in theaters and on demand, offers a powerful example of one possible scenario: life on the road, permanently.

The film, from director Chloé Zhao (""The Rider""), is a travelogue centered on Fern (Frances McDormand), a widowed and unemployed Nevadan who puts most of her belongings into storage and hits the road in her van, retrofitted to be a home on wheels. She drives around the US from work gig to work gig. One job is holiday-season packing at a gargantuan Amazon warehouse in Virginia, another harvesting sugar beets in North Dakota.

Along the way, she connects and reconnects with like-minded travelers, older Americans who, for one reason or another, are living out of their vans and RVs, doing seasonal work and occasionally coming together to trade tips and celebrate nomad life. None of the characters we meet are in truly desperate circumstances, but most seem one serious bout of bad luck away from oblivion. Their vehicles range from minivans to tricked-out trailers. Most of the people in Zhao's film are playing themselves, other than McDormand and a couple of others (a craggy David Strathairn appears as one of her road buddies).

""Nomadland,"" based on the 2017 nonfiction book of the same name by Jessica Bruder, is a masterpiece of natural beauty; its cinematography of the sprawling American west puts it into the company of the classics (""Badlands,"" ""Easy Rider,"" ""Thelma and Louise""). Don't just take my word for it: Zhao is now ""the most awarded filmmaker in a single awards season"" in modern film history, Variety reports

Frances McDormand and Director/Writer Chloé Zhao on the set of ""Nomadland.""

""Nomadland"" is important for many reasons, not least the triumph of a female filmmaker and star (I would not be surprised to see McDormand scoop up more awards herself this year). As cultural commentary, the film is both an invitation to see America through the eyes of its nomads, and a haunting tale about the many reasons one might end up living that life.

Zhao shot the movie in 2018, and couldn't have known that two years later Covid lockdowns would send sales of RVs and camper vans skyrocketing . Suddenly, everyone wanted to hit the road in their own home on wheels -- because that felt like one of the only safe places to be.

I count myself among the camper-aspirational, though the current demand for models my husband and I covet, styled like the vans that are popular across Europe, are so in-demand it's hard to find a used one, and shockingly expensive to buy a new one. My parents, meanwhile, have long been recreational RV'ers. They send us stunning photos of the vistas from their campsites, and stories about where the best places to stay are (Good: Includes dog park. Less good: Near racetrack).

There's a stark divide, of course, between traveling in a camper for recreation and taking to the road because of your financial situation. But that gap may not be as wide as it seems. For many, the pandemic year has been a time of social and economic instability, for reassessing priorities and plans for the future.

Long before Covid hit, the economy wasn't working for non-wealthy Americans, for whom belt-tightening has become all but inevitable. In her review of Bruder's book, sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild speculated that ""the powerful force of automation and the destruction of any safety net may silently push more and more of us onto the open road.""

The pandemic may end up being the tipping point for countless more nomads, particularly older workers forced into early retirement by Covid downsizing. Working women of all ages have been disproportionately hit : last December, women accounted for all of the 140,000 net job losses reported, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Linda May, ""Nomadland,"" 2020

Even when the country fully emerges from lockdown, experts expect the gig economy will continue to replace many former full-time positions. It seems reasonable to expect that more people, many older single women like Fern among them, may decide to do away with exorbitant rent or mortgage costs and embrace life on the road. ""Nomadland"" suggests there are upsides to that decision, alongside the very real risks.

In one chapter of ""Nomadland,"" Fern joins her friend Linda May for a gathering in Quartzsite, Arizona, called Rubber Tramp Rendezvous -- a real annual event founded by ""vandweller"" Bob Wells, known for his YouTube channel CheapRVliving (a ""rubber tramp"" is someone who lives out of their van or RV). In the movie, he talks to the group about the mindset behind the lifestyle, the idea that there's more to life than working yourself to death to acquire more possessions and debt. Nomads tell their own stories around a campfire, including one woman whose dying friend advised her not to wait any longer to see the world, inspiring her to take an earlier retirement and hit the road.

It's hard to watch Zhao's film without worrying for the fates of older nomads working hard physical labor and operating without, it seems likely, health insurance. But her portrayal never invites our pity. To claim control of your own destiny, it suggests, is courageous -- ""part of the American tradition,"" as Fern's more settled sister says (whether or not she means it). At the same time, Zhao points at the cruel lack of safety net: Linda May, who is one of Bruder's central subjects, talks about working her whole life only to find she had minimal Social Security funds.

Opinion: Amanda Gorman reminded America what poetry can do,"(CNN) It is no secret what poetry can do. What Black poetry can do.

Ashley M. Jones

Audre Lorde told us this in 1977. Although she spoke specifically to women, I hope she won't mind me saying that her words can apply to other folks, too. She wrote : ""poetry is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity of our existence. It forms the quality of the light within which we predicate our hopes and dreams toward survival and change, first made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible action.""

And it's true -- as I watched 22-year-old National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman read her piece , ""The Hill We Climb,"" at President Joe Biden's inauguration Wednesday, I felt affirmed in my belief that art is the thing that has and will keep saving us. Poetry, by which I mean the words on a page and the life-force Lorde spoke of, is part of what will help us understand, as Gorman told us, that we must reckon with ""the past we step into,"" that the work is in ""how we repair it.""

What is so important to me, a Black Southern woman who writes her authentic truth in verse, is the incredible door Gorman is opening and will keep opening for us in poetry. As I watched her, gorgeous as she is, walking up to that inaugural podium wearing her red Prada headband like a crown, in her striking yellow coat -- a sun only mirrored by the light emanating from her -- I was so proud of Amanda Gorman.

I was proud to know that she would stand there, not as a mouthpiece for an administration but with her own voice against White patriarchy and oppression. I was proud that she offered celebration for the end of the last four horrific years. I was proud because she accepted the challenge of writing for this very dizzying occasion, because she spoke to the pain of living in a country which has not always been kind to us, and because she was there, visible and glowing, a young Black woman letting us know that her words matter.

Should we give a damn about the Oxford comma? (opinion),"Story highlights A judge recently ruled in favor of Maine truckers because of a missing Oxford comma John McWhorter: Oxford commas ward off ambiguity, but need not be used all the time

Editor’s Note: John McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of “Words on the Move.” The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) —

A recent court case seems like a victory for fans of the grand old Oxford comma. To many, it feels natural to write “Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cleveland.” But just as one may feel lazy saying “My brother and me went home” rather than “My brother and I,” there is a sense that it is more proper to write “Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland,” inserting a comma after the item before the last one.

And people advocating for the Oxford comma have a point now and then. If you were a trucker reading that union rules deny you overtime pay for “the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of agricultural produce,” would you consider yourself due overtime payment nevertheless for distribution? That is, as opposed to packing things for shipping and distribution?

Jeremy Freeman John McWhorter

Truckers for Oakhurst Dairy in Maine have been granted back overtime pay for having distributed product as opposed to packing it, because though the writers of the contract meant that overtime would not be granted for distribution either, this is not clear when there is no comma after shipment. The drivers’ lawyer has successfully argued that the contract appears to stipulate that overtime won’t be granted for, only, the packing of things for future shipping and distribution.

But it’s premature to read this as demonstrating that everybody should always use the Oxford comma. What happened here shows, just as defensibly, that the Oxford comma should be used in cases of potential ambiguity. The people who wrote the union contract made a mistake, but not in way that means all of us should feel bad about writing “hamburgers, hot dogs and French fries.”

We might feel slovenly, however, for writing “I had toast, bacon and eggs and coffee” where one could argue that it’s unclear whether the bacon and eggs went together or eggs and coffee did, or “My parents, Mother Teresa and the Pope,” which implies a rather stunning parental history in casting those two people as your parents, as opposed to persons in sequence with your parents.

I know the objection: Shouldn’t we just use the Oxford comma all the time in the same way that we train teenagers to use turn signals at all times even if no other drivers happen to be present? “It’s good to just get into the habit,” we figure. After all, it means learning just one mechanical gesture to use across the board instead of grappling with the vagaries of judgment calls.

However, this solution runs up against the simple factor of experience. The idea that the Oxford comma is as advisable as storm windows has been a standard meme among literate Americans since, especially, the publication of William Strunk and E.B. White’s Elements of Style in 1959. That’s now almost 70 years ago, and yet the matter remains controversial, not to mention counter-intuitive to many.

Since that time, we have developed a radically new relationship to seatbelts, littering and drunk driving, but writing “Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cleveland” remains comfortable to a great many – including Vampire Weekend and myself – regardless of periodical dunnings from those to whom it is a matter of concern.

This is not a matter of random slobbery. The reason the Oxford comma feels forced so often is because there is already a built-in separation between the final and second element in those phrases: the word “and.” The Oxford comma seems, most of the time, redundant and even clumsy. To me, for example, it has always felt like adding an extra separation or pause – except in cases where that infelicity is worth it to disambiguate, as it certainly was in that truck drivers’ union contract.

Let’s not even get into the fact that sometimes the Oxford comma can, itself, make a mess. Try out “To my mother, Mother Teresa, and the Pope.” Only the Oxford comma makes it sound like Mother Teresa is your mom.

In the grand scheme of things, punctuation is already a historically fluid business, rife with ambiguities that require tutelage and experience to master. Signs advertising “Fresh Fish” rather than Fresh Fish make it clear how easy it is for less educated or immigrant writers to mistake quotation marks as substitutes for underlining – my favorite example of this was a store in New York advertising that one could Make “A” Salad! Meanwhile, people have conversations of Seinfeldian outrage over the use of the em-dash. And the accepted use of the semicolon is alien to a great many.

Written conventions are nasty enough and aren’t going away. Must we foist yet another one on innocent persons by requiring an unnecessary comma as a universal traffic rule? What, precisely, is the argument against treating the Oxford comma as a tool for clarity?

Of course, to treat the failure to use the Oxford comma as a mark of mental messiness is a handy way to look down on what will perhaps always be a majority of people attempting to write English. However, the last time I checked, we cherished tamping down our tribalist and elitist tendencies as much as possible, which strikes me as combining generosity, rigor and goodwill. Pardon me, incidentally, if that list of qualities occasioned any ambiguity with its lack of an Oxford comma.",2017-03-19 00:00:00
Opinion: What happened when my dad met a bully,"Greg Bardsley is the author of the novels ""Cash Out"" (2012) and ""The Bob Watson"" (2016) from HarperCollins Publishers.

(CNN) As a child, my dad was so small that people called him Minnow.

Greg Bardsley

His size often invited teasing, ridicule and bullying. One day in grade school, it culminated with an older (and much larger) bully challenging my dad to a fight in front of everyone after school.

As my dad would tell me, his stomach was tied in knots for the rest of the day. He didn't want to fight, and he knew that if he did fight, he almost certainly would get beat up. Hounded by giddy classmates all day — ""Minnow, what are you gonna do?"" — my dad told them that he would show up for the fight. He knew that if he cowed, the bully would be emboldened and things for everyone would only get worse.

Frothy excitement engulfed the school as news spread that Minnow would fight the bully. Finally, the school bell rang, and my dad walked to the specified location, followed by a throng of curious classmates. Fear gripped him.

When my dad finally arrived, the bully wasn't there.

Welcome to the Fractured States of America,"Christine M. says that her stepfather canceled his plane ticket to her wedding in Utah because of their political differences (she’s anti-President Donald Trump, he’s pro). Justin M. won’t wear his MAGA hat in his hometown of Boston for fear he’ll be humiliated. Richard G., an independent who lives in the Tampa area, put a “No Politics Zone” sign on his door after several Trump-supporting coworkers challenged him over the latest political headlines.

Mario Benavente, a North Carolina Republican, puts it simply: “Political debate right now is a blood sport.”

These folks are only a snapshot of the reality facing Americans today. Many parents no longer want their children marrying people from a different political party — 35% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats, to be precise. Workers, like Richard, feel politics simply has no place in the office. And Americans at large dread the idea of Thanksgiving dinners with family members who might bring up President Donald Trump. Some on the right are even concerned we are on the verge of a new Civil War.

“Political debate right now is a blood sport.” – Mario Benavente, a North Carolina Republican

In 2019, there’s only one thing that unites us: just how divided we think we are. In fact, according to the Public Religion Research Institute, 91% of Americans feel we are polarized — and 74% feel we are extremely polarized.

Welcome to the Fractured States of America. In this series, over the next three weeks, we’ll explore the new landscape of a polarized America and examine ways to get beyond it, with the help of frequent CNN Opinion contributors and many new voices, including those of our readers.

The harm it’s causing

Politics is now a major source of stress for Americans. According to Pew Research Center, almost 50% of Republicans and nearly 60% of Democrats say discussing partisan issues — be they abortion, immigration or gun control — can be “stressful and frustrating.” And increased levels of stress are often linked to increased risks of chest pain, headache and sleeping problems. Not surprisingly, then, many Americans have also reported losing sleep and experiencing bouts of depression because of political tensions.

But it gets worse. Political division increases the risk of violence. As people begin to identify with one party or another, they isolate themselves and can become more extreme in their views. According to data from two national surveys, 15% of self-identifying Republicans and 20% of self-identifying Democrats think the country would be better if members of the opposing party “just died.” And almost 10% of people who identify as members of both major parties think violence would be acceptable if the opposing party’s candidate won the next presidential election. While these individuals represent a minority of surveyed participants, the fact that any voters are thinking in these terms is cause for alarm.

We’ve been here before

Of course, this is not the first time this country has experienced political division. At the founding of the United States, America’s first president, George Washington, warned of the dangers of partisanship — stating in his Farewell Address, “It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and … foments occasionally riot and insurrection.”

Watch: John Avlon on the problem with polarization

And his fears came to a frightening reality less than 100 years later when the issue of slavery led to the outbreak of the Civil War. The US lost 750,000 lives in that war, or approximately 2% of its population. But the end of the war in 1865 did not spell a unified vision for the future.

From the Great Depression to the Vietnam War, the 20th century was marked by periods of division over economic inequality, political ideology and the use of military force. However, as documentary filmmaker Ken Burns explains to CNN, “the essential thing about history, though it catalogs so many injustices and indignities, is that it always shows us that particularly the American example moves back to the center.”

For now, though, the pendulum appears to have swung toward the extremes.

How we got here

Just pause for a moment and think about the town or city you call home. How many of your neighbors voted the same way you did in the last presidential election cycle? Probably most of them. And if they didn’t, research indicates you may be considering relocating sometime soon.

Just 40 years ago, most districts in the US were swing districts. Today, less than half of them are. And this is unlikely to change anytime soon, as more and more people move to neighborhoods where they likely won’t encounter anyone who holds an opposing political view.

So, what happened over the last four decades? Journalist Bill Bishop explains we’ve been self-sorting ourselves since the 1970s, when geographic inequality in education grew. That meant Americans with college degrees began clustering in big cities, while less-educated people remained in more rural areas. And jobs migrated accordingly, with technology and production following the new city dwellers.

This clustering was followed by the rise of partisan media, social media networks and a market that was built quite literally on catering to those divisions. In other words, entire identities — defined by diet, media patterns and size of home — have been created around party affiliation. And, as sociological research explains, place, and even consumption habits, have become a way of creating identity and broadcasting it to the world — or, at least, our closest neighbor.

The dangers of self-sorting

There is an inherent danger in this form of identity politicking — it’s isolating and pushes people into their respective political tribes. In these tribes, they are not forced to rigorously interrogate their belief systems.

Identifying with our tribes isn’t inherently bad, notes SE Cupp. “Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA. The need to identify with a group, to belong and commune with like-minded people is not only biological, it’s what has helped motivate our desire for and devotion to all kinds of important cultural institutions, from organized religion to sports fandom.”

What isn’t natural, she says, is the increased importance we attach to politics, or the rigid allegiance to a specific political tribe — and the misperceptions of the other side that accompany it.

“Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA.” – SE Cupp, host of “SE Cupp Unfiltered”

So much of our division, or our perceived level of discomfort with the opposing party, is imagined. For many liberals, listening to a Ted Cruz speech is seen as nails on a chalkboard, or slightly less painful than a root canal. And for conservatives, the same might be said about Bernie Sanders. Yet Harvard researchers found that the negative anticipation both sides had about these experiences far exceeded the result. When forced to listen to Cruz and Sanders, both groups said it was much more tolerable than they expected.

But it’s hard for liberals, conservatives and even independents — who research suggests usually have partisan leanings — to realize this because they live in their echo chambers, which often reinforce their existing beliefs and make them even more polarized. All of this comes at a cost — creating a massive perception gap between what Americans suspect their political opponents think and what the reality is.

The other cost? Awkward family gatherings — be it for the holidays, weddings or funerals. People feel increasingly uncomfortable around their Fox News-loving grandfather or their New York Times-subscribing granddaughter. And research indicates the solution to this is simply to not engage in political debate. Stick to sports or the weather. But do not mention the White House or its current inhabitant.

But there is some good news

Most Americans are not hyper-partisans. They comprise the “exhausted majority,” writes scholar Daniel Yudkin. They are flexible in their politics and open to compromise — especially if that means advancing legislation on issues like gun reform.

And there may be a way to re-engage them in the political process. Deborah Fallows recommends starting on the local level. While our national government may seem paralyzed most days, towns — big and small — “are often and strongly acting in a united way, facing their problems, negotiating their solutions and taking action for the greater good of their communities,” she says.

The reason is pretty simple. At the local level, people recognize the bucks stop with them — and they cannot wait for someone else to “save” them. If a school is failing, if a bridge is breaking, they are the ones who can move quickest to address the situation.

Ken Burns has another idea — share stories. “We all have stories. And sometimes they lead us back to emotions and feelings we have in common,” he explains. That may require breaking out of our red and blue silos and actually grabbing beers (Coors is the preferred drink of both parties!) with someone of a different political persuasion.

But it also involves having a frank discussion of what our core American values are.

“We all have stories. And sometimes they lead us back to emotions and feelings we have in common.” – Ken Burns, American filmmaker

What are our core values

At the “Looking For America” dinner organized by New American Economy, American University School of Public Affairs and Curiosity Connects at the El Paso Museum of History, guests were asked to bring an item that illustrates their connection to their community.

Andrea Beltran, a liberal leaning writer and poet, shared her great-grandmother's 1920 nonresident alien border crossing card, containing the only photo Beltran has of the family matriarch. She explained that the card represents the idea of identity “being something hard to locate and even harder to define.” In this climate of what she calls “heavy patriotism and nationalism,” her great-grandmother reminds her just how complicated, and perhaps even dangerous, it can be to define who is and who is not American simply on the basis of birth.

John Moye, a moderate Republican and development manager for the Housing Authority, brought a 1944 El Paso Times newspaper article, which recounted his father’s experience as a prisoner of war in then-Nazi Germany. His father, who enlisted in the military the day after Pearl Harbor, survived 10 months as a POW before eventually returning to Texas. Moye emphasized that the article shows how much people at the height of World War II ""truly gave of themselves and asked for little in return,"" a kind of patriotism he worries Americans are now losing.

Though Beltran and Moye are lifelong El Pasoans with strong connections to the city they call home, their items of choice reflect their different perspectives on this country’s fundamental values. Beltran chose the nonresident card to emphasize the complexity, but also beauty of American identity. It’s not singular — it’s messy, multilingual and built on the backs of immigrants. And trying to narrowly define it hurts us as a nation.

Moye used the newspaper clipping to showcase the importance of having a clear national identity and parlaying that into sacrifice for one’s country. His choice reflects a nostalgia for a different time, and perhaps even generation, when duty to country came first. Back then, Americans were united around a common cause — and had a strong sense of community. These days, for so many, both cause and community hang in the balance, he says.

Beltran and Moye’s differences on what American national identity should or could be is just one example of the fractured state of America. But their ability to break bread together also offers a ray of hope — one that is premised on the notion that the US is stronger because of its diversity of views, rather than its uniform acceptance of any one ideology.

As Beltran phrased it, “the best thing about this dinner was it reminded me of the human connection.” Moye seconded her, noting that though he disagreed with some of Beltran’s views, he was so grateful “that a space was finally created for these kinds of tough conversations. This country needs more of them.”",
Asheville's woes are the story of America,"David Daley is the author of "" Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn't Count ."" His work has appeared in the New Yorker, Atlantic and Washington Post, among other publications. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) If you want to understand how American politics has become more polarized and extreme over the last decade, look no farther than Asheville, North Carolina -- now split between two of the most gerrymandered districts in the country.

Artists, independent spirits and environmentalists have traditionally flocked to this hippie enclave, surrounded by conservative hill towns, for the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, thriving local brewpubs, vegan cafes and independent bookstores.

And, a decade ago, North Carolina's 11th congressional district, with Asheville at its heart, was among the nation's most competitive, see-sawing with shifting political winds. It favored Republicans during the two elections that followed the September 11 attacks, then veered toward Democrats beginning in 2006 as the Iraq war stagnated and stock market tumbled.

This district does not swing any longer. Asheville is now represented by two of the most conservative members of Congress , including the outgoing chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who have won their races since 2012 by double-digit averages

Why? Because while the old map preserved Asheville in one competitive district, the new one sliced the city in half, scattering its voters across two districts in a way that ensured a Republican captured both seats.

But when the 11th district switched from a toss-up to safely Republican, the entire political dynamic changed. Without a competitive general election, the real action moved to the GOP primary, where turnout tends to be lower, and limited to the activist base. Only the most ideological extreme candidates stood a chance.

Not surprisingly, many locals are unhappy with this reality. ""The majority of the electorate in Asheville feels that their views are not represented in Congress,"" Mayor Esther Manheimer said in March . The matter is not settled; judges recently blocked the congressional map from being used in 2020 elections.

Of course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains.

And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy -- and many politicians -- beyond the reach of the ballot box.

But which came first: the extreme gerrymanders or the heightened polarization? The reality is that each acts as an accelerant on the other, exacerbating a situation these politicians candidly describe in amicus briefs before the US Supreme Court as a Montague vs. Capulet-styled Shakespearean bloodbath.

Gerrymandered districts have also helped create an epidemic of minority rule nationwide, driving state politics to extremes not supported by voters who find themselves unable to do anything about it.

Almost 60 million Americans live in a state where one or both chambers of legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer statewide votes in the 2018 election. A new study finds that with fair lines, 59 congressional seats would have changed hands in 2012, 2014 and 2016. (Republicans gained 39 seats they would not have won; Democrats secured 20.)

Of course, gerrymandering has been part of our politics from the start . The bad news for democracy is that we're better at gerrymandering than ever before. Powerful computers , sophisticated mapping software and terabytes of voter, census and consumer data -- alongside growing polarization -- make it possible to draw surgical district lines that provide sturdy bulwarks against electoral waves and maximize partisan advantage across an entire state.

It's more than geography: Multiple academic studies, involving tens of thousands of neutral maps, consistently show that the partisan-drawn maps in the most gerrymandered states are radical outliers.

Neither political party has more historical virtue when it comes to gerrymandering, but GOP strategists outplayed their DNC counterparts ahead of the 2010 election, recognizing that redistricting provided a path back to power after the party's 2008 walloping at the hands of President Barack Obama.

In fact, the GOP invested $30 million into state legislative races in closely divided states like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina, seeking to win full control of congressional and state legislative maps. The lines Republicans drew the following year stuck.

It was a political masterstroke: Every 10 years, following the census, congressional lines are redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the state legislature takes the lead, so the GOP's modest investment paid handsome dividends. (As a result, Democrats controlled the process in fewer states than Republicans, so they lacked the same opportunities to gerrymander in 2010. They did take full advantage of their biggest opportunity, drawing a map that pushed their advantage in Maryland all the way to 7-1.)

But most Americans vote in uncompetitive districts, where the outcome is pre-ordained and reflective of only the most partisan extremes. Uncompetitive districts elect a different kind of politician, who is then incentivized to cater only to their base.

Missouri, It doesn't have to be this way. Americans hate gerrymandering and believe in fair elections, evident by the various initiatives and constitutional amendments that passed in 2018, including successful efforts to stop politicians from drawing their own districts and choosing their own voters in Michigan Colorado, Ohio and Utah

Many of our national divisions are real and difficult to bridge. Gerrymandering, however, is self-inflicted. We've done this to ourselves -- but we can undo it, too.",2019-11-23 00:00:00

And it could point the way for more,"Van Jones is CEO of REFORM Alliance and co-founder of #cut50, a bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) In this era of extreme political division, one issue is bringing people together: the need to invest in public safety solutions that reduce crime and make the criminal justice system fairer.

For the first time in my life, it appears every presidential candidate is running as a champion of criminal justice reform -- including (to the shock of many) Donald J. Trump . It is an astonishing reversal in both political parties. For decades, ambitious politicians tried to outdo each other with ""lock 'em up"" policies and ""tough-on-crime"" rhetoric.

This dynamic accelerated after George H.W. Bush crushed Massachusetts Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race. Popular wisdom attributed the win to television ads spotlighting a prisoner named Willie Horton , who committed heinous crimes while part of Dukakis' prison furlough program. Afterward, generations of politicians were afraid to champion prison reform.

So, how did justice reform emerge as the one cause that brings people together? The answers are complicated -- and surprising.

I have a special perspective on the topic. In California, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights , which I co-founded in 1996, helped to close five abusive youth prisons; we also blocked construction of a draconian ""super jail for youth"" near Oakland. Five years ago, I co-founded the Dream Corps' #cut50 campaign with Jessica Jackson and Matt Haney, through which we passed more than a dozen bipartisan criminal justice bills at the state level, plus last year's federal First Step Act . This year, I helped launch the REFORM Alliance , which aims to shrink and transform the probation and parole systems.

I have dedicated my life to this cause. But I have never seen anything like 2019 -- a year in which all presidential candidates and both parties are fighting over who can be trusted to put fewer people behind bars while reducing crime.

The magic moment

Any shift of this magnitude has many causes. Let's explore the top five:

1. The trifecta

Finally, lawmakers eventually got frustrated investing billions into a system that was failing to rehabilitate a majority of people who came into contact with it. Incarceration fatigue opened the door to new ways of thinking about crime prevention that address underlying causes -- like mental health, drugs, trauma, etc. And so leaders began shifting resources to create specialty courts -- veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts -- across the country.

2. Culture shift

The television series, ""Orange is the New Black,"" brought binge-watching Americans inside the lives of women living behind bars. Ava DuVernay's explosive documentary, ""The 13th,"" and Netflix series, ""When They See Us,"" broke hearts. Other documentaries and podcasts, from ""Time: The Kalief Browder Story"" to ""Serial,"" opened the public's eyes

Authors like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson shook the consciences of those who read their works. Shaka Senghor's bestselling book, ""Writing My Wrongs,"" won the admiration of Oprah Winfrey and helped to open the floodgates for formerly incarcerated authors. And in recent years, household names like Common, John Legend, Alicia Keys and Kim Kardashian have become outspoken advocates.

This wave of popular media pushed into mainstream living rooms and reached beyond the pool of those who once paid attention to the incarceration system. It is now common knowledge that the United States, shamefully, has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

3. Democratic value: Justice

Many people assume that Democrats always opposed mass incarceration. That is a myth. Democrats overwhelmingly backed President Bill Clinton's disastrous 1994 crime bill. The deep blue state of California just recently began to dig itself out of an incarceration crisis that resulted in the construction of more than 20 prisons but only one university in the past generation. And the national Democratic Party's platform carefully excluded any reference to criminal justice reform until 2016

So, what changed? Many things -- from #BlackLivesMatter to the opioid crisis

Seeing African American communities devastated by decades of overpolicing and excessive incarceration, a new generation of black activists rebelled. Starting in 2013, they demanded that Democrats address head-on the issues of racist police abuse and racial bias in the justice system. Their passion gave more political room for traditional civil rights and civil liberties organizations to accelerate their own longstanding reform efforts.

Pushed past the breaking point, the incarceration generation rose up and insisted that Democrats speak out boldly against the racial injustice in the system. Today, all Democrats echo their call. The protests that started in 2013 have yielded a Democratic Party today that is more firmly grounded in its core ideals of racial, gender and social justice.

But Democrats also know the Republicans aren't going to ""Willie Horton"" them, since so many conservatives are also embracing the cause.

4. Republican value: Liberty

their own Many on the left doubt the sincerity of criminal justice reformers on the right. They can't believe that Republicans would truly care about a ""racial justice"" issue. But the truth is that Republicans have reasons to oppose the incarceration industry.

Republicans care a lot about public safety. But the ""tough on crime"" system made many communities less safe . Today, many conservatives want an evidence-based system that focuses on reducing crime. They've returned to principles that resonate deeply on the right as they joined the fight for reform.

Another conservative principle is the desire for transparency, accountability and limits on government overreach. Libertarians especially don't want the government to have too much power over individual lives. The Koch brothers fall into this category. So do US Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul and advocacy groups like FreedomWorks.

Yet another conservative value is the faith-based belief in human dignity. Religious conservatives, including Newt Gingrich, worry the present system leaves no real opportunity for second chances or personal redemption. When he was the Republican governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant explicitly cited his Christian faith as the source of his passion for prison reform

Black pro-Trump conservatives like Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson are working to return a pro-Lincoln, pro-freedom ethic inside the GOP on this issue.

5. The Trump factor

Then there is the most surprising plot twist of all: Trump's decision to release Alice Johnson . The world watched as Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who had been sentenced to die in prison, ran across the road into her family's arms. We began to hear the President shift from describing himself as ""tough on crime"" to expressing that he's tough but fair and recognizing the disproportionate sentencing in the justice system. Surrounded by law enforcement, faith leaders, Republican members and even several Democrats, Trump then endorsed adding sentencing reform to the First Step Act, which he signed into law later that year.

Because many red state governors took the lead , this Republican President could engage on criminal justice reform without risking his base. More importantly, key people in Trump's inner circle -- including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- were strong allies. This opened the door for formerly incarcerated people (on the left and right) to make repeated visits to the White House, sharing their experiences with senior officials of how the existing system failed them.

People on both sides of the aisle should be glad that Trump decided to adopt the cause -- and not crush it. Criminal justice reform could have fallen into a divisive stalemate like guns, climate or immigration. Instead, Trump's decision to embrace criminal justice reform has set Republicans free to work with Democrats. That's a good thing for both parties -- and a very good thing for the people suffering behind bars.

Lessons beyond criminal justice

I've spent time in red states, blue states, Appalachia and urban neighborhoods. I see the same problems everywhere: generational poverty, addiction, underperforming schools, lack of access to mental health services and a broken criminal justice system. Neither party has been able to make a real dent in these problems facing low-income communities.

The sad truth is that Republicans get a lot of votes from poor, rural communities -- but have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. Democrats get a lot of votes from poor, urban communities -- but we have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. That's why I came to believe in bottom-up bipartisanship -- centered on addressing the pain of the people at the bottom in both parties.

However, here is what I know: Change is possible -- and criminal justice reform is evidence of that. As recently as 2014, the idea of ""bipartisan criminal justice reform"" was an oxymoron. Now it is almost a cliché. And, symbolically, Alice Johnson has replaced Willie Horton as the iconic image of a formerly incarcerated person.

When I started 25 years ago, politicians in both parties promised to lock up more people, treat them more harshly and keep them behind bars longer. Today, leaders in both parties say we should lock up fewer people, help them transform their lives and send them home better, not bitter.

Criminal justice reform is renewing the right's dedication to individual ""liberty"" and deepening the left's commitment to social ""justice."" As a result, we still have a chance to build a country with ""liberty"" and ""justice"" for all.",2019-12-05 00:00:00
Conservative: She was not a faceless liberal,"Julia Song is a Brazilian-American political activist and commentator, who has been featured on OANN, Rebel Media and elsewhere. Follow her on Twitter @realjuliasong. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) I am a political activist by nature. In my home country of Brazil, I helped organize peaceful protests against government corruption and abuses of power. At the time -- way back in 2013 -- Brazil was plagued by scandal, with much of the population living in poverty. And yet the country's politicians, the source of so much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and few others.

But with excessive spending on the World Cup draining the country's already depleted resources, I was able to find a path forward with Brazilians from across the political spectrum. Our collective protests helped lead to a government investigation into corruption. Ultimately, many politicians went to prison , and the country's president -- Dilma Rousseff -- was impeached

Shortly after the protests, I moved to the United States on a family visa, where I was granted temporary residency, allowing me the right to work. I then began a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and the financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy.

Arriving to this new country, I thought that my activism days were behind me. But then I noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans just trying to get by. Sensing the disconnect -- and the growing power of the political elite -- I began using the power of social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram, and then on Twitter.

I advocated for my belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms -- and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. If you haven't guessed yet, I'm a Republican, and I support President Donald Trump's emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans.

SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of "" SE Cupp Unfiltered ."" The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.

This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.

And a third party that makes it its raison d'etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.

Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up -- and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we're usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren't good enough.

The immigration disconnect

Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders --that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.

As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.

Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted : ""Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it's time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.""

What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters -- or who had read recent polls -- was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.

According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.

But this was a Democratic primary -- the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?

No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn't. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.

Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.

What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?

The politics of extremes

This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.

On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day.

Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in ""the Squad"" -- Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley -- get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.

A so-called "" alterna-squad ,"" a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I've heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, ""Well I can't vote for Trump, but I'm not with those guys, either.""

In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that ""finding common ground"" is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence ""a decent guy."")

Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most ""divisive.""

The silent middle majority

Take abortion. ""[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,"" according to Pew . Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us -- the majority -- agree it should be legal but with restrictions.

Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.

A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn't those voters feel betrayed by that?

Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties' willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.

While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don't , what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.

Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally -- a path to legal status -- if they meet some requirements over time.

And as it turns out, that's what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we're to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.

So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?

Legislative solutions aren't profitable

Here's the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn't as politically profitable as keeping them broken.

Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.

Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.

As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to ""own the Libs,"" and Democratic voters are happy being ""the resistance,"" it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.

Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.

Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.

All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That's likely only going to get worse.

A party by the middle and for the middle

A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn't be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn't take this position or that one, and it wouldn't have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.

For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican -- a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew , a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.

That third party would also lean pro-abortion -- keeping Roe v. Wade in place -- but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.

It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn't, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.

It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.

In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn't on either extreme. There wouldn't be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn't have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.

One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can't, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.

Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.

There's also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.

So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.

Finally, whether an alternative party in today's age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn't swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn't designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one's blood pressure almost instantly.

Because let's face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America's future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we'll all be politically homeless eventually.",2019-12-04 00:00:00
Confronting the cult of partisan media,"John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) America is self-segregating into separate political realities. And partisan media is driving much of this division across new platforms, polarizing for profit while amplifying extreme voices and achieving unprecedented reach -- including the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump is a creature of partisan media, having kicked off his political career with regular appearances on Fox News. His obsessive consumption causes him to echo its talking points , often overriding information from US intelligence agencies. This leaves him susceptible to conspiracy theories that have now led to the fourth impeachment inquiry in our history.

We've always had partisan media in America, with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson slashing each other in the pages of competing broadsheets on the same street in Philadelphia.

What we're dealing with today is different because of the pervasive scale of partisan media and its dissemination alongside disinformation. Its proliferation has been hastened by the rise of a partisan economy amid a fragmented media market, aiming to keep a narrow but intense niche audience addicted to anger, anxiety and resentment. But this is a Faustian bargain, because it requires going to ever-increasing extremes to keep the audience engaged while constantly attacking the credibility of nonpartisan news organizations.

The rise of social media has balkanized us further , amplifying the loudest voices, often manipulating perceptions of public opinion via anonymous bots and trolls, while driving many reasonable people from the public square of civic debate. These disinformation deployments often shape the tone of partisan media while exploiting the lack of trust it has helped create.

JUST WATCHED Avlon: Our enemies know America is polarized Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Avlon: Our enemies know America is polarized 03:34

The result is real: A new Pew Survey shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That's a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems.

This is also an unhealthy departure from our best traditions. We had partisan newspapers in the past that, for example, excoriated and defended the New Deal, but there was still a general baseline commitment to facts and a clear delineation between news and editorial opinion. On the broadcast side, the fairness doctrine, introduced in 1949, was a condition of leasing federal airwaves that aimed to ensure balance by requiring time for opposing political views.

That doesn't mean there were not deep disagreements and bitter debate.

The Joe McCarthy test

America was tested by the rise of Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, a conservative, populist anti-communist with a demagogue's disregard for facts. While accusing Democrats of treason, McCarthy often tried to play the victim of the liberal elite media , equating The Washington Post with the communist Daily Worker -- while in fact old-line Republican papers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Herald Tribune were also warning about McCarthy's tactics.

McCarthy's rise on the back of wild accusations caused some editors to question whether the traditional approach of simply reporting what a public official said was consistent with the larger responsibility of telling the truth. But McCarthy met his match in Edward R. Murrow, the legendary CBS broadcast news pioneer, who took on McCarthy by fact-checking his public statements, closing his show in March 1954 by saying , ""We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. ... We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason.""

But Murrow vs. McCarthy was a notable exception in a post-war period. Despite the stickiness of who was determining what was fair and balanced, the fairness doctrine proved surprisingly popular among conservatives and liberals who believed it ensured a degree of ""public interest"" programming. When it was overturned by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987, the Senate voted 59-31 to reinstate it on bipartisan lines -- but it was vetoed by former President Ronald Reagan.

This is when partisan media as we know it began to proliferate.

From the fairness doctrine to Fox News

One study by former chief economist at the FCC Thomas Winslow Hazlett, recounted in his book "" The Political Spectrum ,"" found that talk radio took off after the fairness doctrine was dismantled, displacing what had been the most popular radio format: music. Our country got more polarized as partisan opinion became big business, untethered from any obligation to be fair and balanced.

This was the moment Roger Ailes had been waiting for. A one-time talk show producer-turned-political consultant, Ailes pushed a political strategy called ""positive polarization"" in Richard Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. While Nixon repeated ""the press is the enemy"" like a mantra, Ailes envisioned the creation of a conservative news network that could counteract major newspapers and the big three networks.

Ailes had the opportunity to operationalize his partisan dream with the launch of Fox News in 1996. Extending the popularity of right-wing talk radio into cable news, the idea was simple and sinister: Only explicit bias could balance the implicit bias of the mainstream media. But in a breathtaking bit of cynicism, this partisan project would be sold as "" fair and balanced .""

Later that same year, MSNBC launched and evolved into a liberal counterweight. The partisan media arms race was on. But what is good for ratings can be bad for the country.

Partisan media and the decline of trust

The impact was clear: Just over a decade later, a Pew Survey on media credibility found that ""virtually every news organization or program has seen its credibility marks decline."" Even C-SPAN, which offers unedited coverage of public events, experienced a steep decline in believability. In this hyper-partisan environment, people literally weren't trusting what they see with their own eyes.

Instead of creating more informed citizens, partisan media compounded tribalism through an echo chamber -- a loose network of blogs, talk radio and partisan cable news that mainstreamed conspiracy theories and increasingly gave talking points to party leaders rather than vice versa.

Then came social media. It promised to break down barriers, but instead of simply being a great leveler, it was quickly hijacked by operatives who realized that it was also the greatest vehicle for disinformation ever devised.

The Trump effect

All these dynamics contributed to the rise of Donald Trump to the presidency. He took his reality television celebrity and morphed it into political influence with weekly segments on ""Fox and Friends,"" where he started peddling the birther conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was ineligible to be president.

But it was his use of Twitter to hijack news cycles with outrageous statements that really boosted his presidential campaign. What Trump understood better than most is that news doesn't have a liberal or a conservative bias as much as a conflict bias -- and he supplied constant conflict in ways that fired up his base while dominating news cycles on stations and sites across the political spectrum.

The Republican establishment couldn't stop his rise, because the conservative base had become radicalized by hyper-partisan media while many on the center-right had opted out of the party.

It was a joint effort. During the 2016 campaign, Trump relied on regular strategic conversations with Ailes and Sean Hannity, while bringing on the former head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, to run his campaign. Put simply, Trump promoted hyper-partisan media, and they promoted him in return.

On the most extreme edge, we even learned that the campaign's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, was back-channeling with Breitbart to influence their immigration coverage with white nationalist sites. On a far more prominent and less fringe scale, The Washington Post's Erik Wemple chronicled Hannity's many mentions in campaign emails and called him their ""chief propagandist ... looped in on all their talking points, their deflections and their innumerable attacks.""

During the final weeks of the campaign, when few even inside Trump's orbit believed he could win, Trump was musing about starting his own right-wing television station -- Trump TV -- to be led by none other than Ailes. It would allow him to monetize the movement he'd begun while continuing its momentum based on the idea that the election had been stolen.

But trolls and bots on social media -- many of them connected to Russia -- were engaging in an all-out final push to try to elect Trump, exploiting the environment of extremism and distrust that partisan media created, posting intentionally fake stories at an accelerated rate. In the final three months of the campaign, the top performing intentionally false stories on Facebook -- designed to benefit Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton -- out-performed the top news stories from actual publications, according to the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.

The top two fake news stories were Pope Francis' (non-existent) endorsement of Trump and Wikileaks' ""confirmation"" of Hillary Clinton's weapons sales to ISIS -- which reached more than 1.7 million people. One analyst explained that ""it seems pretty clear that false information outperforms true information.""

President-elect Trump quickly tried to twist the term ""fake news"" -- which helped him win the election -- to refer to any independent journalism that displeased him in any way. He has used the term more than 1,100 times since inauguration, according to Factba.se, while autocrats around the world approvingly picked up the term.

Partisan media was in the White House, and Trump's relationship with Fox News became something unseen in American history -- with the President constantly watching and tweeting out promos to friendly shows while hiring more than 20 administration aides from the extended Fox talent pool.

When his staffers burnt out or were forced out, they often found jobs at Fox -- while a few lonely correspondents and anchors such as Shepard Smith committed to facts found themselves under fire from viewers as well as the President.

""I've never seen anything like it before,"" Fox News president-turned-NYU journalism professor Joe Peyronnin told The New Yorker's Jane Mayer . ""It's as if the President had his own press organization. It's not healthy.""

Partisan media takes over the White House

We see that partisan media has completed its takeover of the White House -- electing and bolstering an unpopular President while perpetuating a separate political reality for his supporters. But there is a cost to living in that closed environment.

The fourth impeachment inquiry in American history was launched because Trump bought into discredited conspiracy theories that Ukraine -- not Russia -- had hacked the Democratic National Committee while pushing that country's new President to investigate the family of his chief political rival. These ideas were allegedly spread from interested parties and fringe sites to being investigated by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani -- who fed information to The Hill's John Solomon -- whose articles created ""evidence"" used to justify the investigation. Solomon would in turn promote his stories on Hannity's show on Fox News -- creating a confirmation bias feedback loop built on falsehoods, or what the President's supporters might call ""alternative facts.""

The media coverage of the subsequent impeachment inquiry hearings was also polarized, with one side focused on testimony and facts, while the other side attacked the State Department and White House witnesses as ""Never Trumpers,"" "" nerdy guys ,"" ""radicals,"" ""partisan bureaucrats"" and even a "" self-important, very narcissistic diplomatic snowflake ."" There's an inability to agree on basic facts, and instead the politics of personal attacks seem to have aligned with the President's talking points.

Confronting an age of unreason

There's no question that partisan media has driven the polarization that's afflicting our nation. It is driving the agenda in the White House. And proximity to power creates a gravitational pull toward normalization.

But the partisan echo chamber is a route to radicalization. As Cass Sunstein explains in his book ""Going to Extremes,"" ""A good way to create an extremist group, or a cult of any kind, is to separate members from the rest of society. The separation can occur physically or psychologically, by creating a sense of suspicion about non-members. With such separation, the information and views of those outside the group can be discredited, and hence nothing will disturb the process of polarization as group members continue to talk.""

Partisan media has gone from advancing an ideological agenda to something uglier, something like a cult that is peddling special knowledge -- undermining our ability to reason together as Americans, while sharpening tribal divides.",2019-11-22 00:00:00
26 voices on why the free press matters,"Programming note: Watch CNN Special Report “Battle in the Briefing Room: The President vs. the Press” Thursday at 9 p.m. ET.

(CNN) —

2017 was a year when discussions of press freedom and the media’s choices reached a new level of intensity.

White House briefings, presidential tweets and rallies critiqued the media.

Journalists pushed back, while engaging in lively debate about the ways they approach their work.

And, perhaps fittingly, the year is about to end with the release of “The Post,” a Steven Spielberg film, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, that retells the story of how an administration tried, and ultimately failed, to stop newspapers from printing a damning government report about the Vietnam War.

Despite the news coverage, the Hollywood treatment and the millions of words of commentary about these issues, just how much do most of us truly understand about why journalists do what they do and why the Constitution affords protection for free expression?

Allie Schmitz/CNN

In response to that question, CNN Opinion published articles by 26 leading thinkers and writers on the history of press freedom and the challenges the media face today in America and around the world.

In these essays, authors explore how press freedom protects everyone who is active on social media and empowers people to question and ultimately strengthen the institutions that deeply affect our lives.

They show how dictatorship flourishes when the press is silenced. They explain why America’s free press is a model for the world. They describe what happened when a US president stopped the publication of articles about a study that delved into the government’s role in conducting an unpopular war. They demonstrate how past administrations have worked to moderate the natural conflict between the White House and the press.

They examine how to combat false information on social platforms and why the term “fake news” obscures more than it reveals. They recount why conservatives lost faith in the mainstream media and what happens when the press gets it wrong. They delve into the challenges facing the media today, from information overload to rebuilding trust with skeptical audiences.

We believe these views offer a good foundation for framing the debates that will no doubt endure into 2018 – and beyond.

Democracy's immune system is in trouble. Here's what we can do,"Craig Newmark is the founder of Craigslist and the Craig Newmark Philanthropies, which supports and connects nonprofit communities and drives civic engagement. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. This is the next installment in CNN Opinion's series on the challenges facing the media as it is under attack from critics, governments and changing technology.

(CNN) Throughout history, the media has been used to manipulate and influence political outcomes. Julius Caesar used war journaling, or a written firsthand account of war and its rationale, to justify the invasion and destruction of the Gallic tribes two millennia ago. His heir, Octavian, used a disinformation campaign to convince the Senate to declare war against Mark Antony.

In later years, new communications tools, such as the printing press and moveable type, made it easier for philosophers including John Locke and Thomas Paine to influence new forms of democracy, which, while imperfect, have been more successful than other forms of government.

What these historic figures didn't have access to is digital technology, which democratizes media but also eases the spread of disinformation. The internet allows all who have access to participate, but it also amplifies the effectiveness of media manipulation via automation. Botnets (which are made up of networks of individual, social media and bot accounts that appear to be owned by real people) act as a force multiplier, distributing disinformation in the form of ""fake news"" on a massive scale. We saw this in the 2016 US presidential election, as Russian propaganda flooded social media platforms to divide the nation.

However, a broad community of good actors, including foundations and nonprofits committed to journalistic integrity, are emerging to promote media literacy and good-faith reporting. As a news consumer and a philanthropist (not an expert), I'm invested in supporting these knowledgeable institutions and initiatives to ensure that we have access to fair and accurate reporting. I care about this issue because I believe a strong, vigorous and trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy.

Last year that immune system failed, which is why we need to focus on rebuilding and sustaining a trustworthy press now more than ever. While a complex task, given the evolving uses of technology in spreading disinformation, in order to remedy this issue we must create a more formalized journalistic code of ethics for the digital age.

(CNN) The hilariously inept attack on the Washington Post by an organization run by right-wing prankster James O'Keefe -- his latest in a catalog of failures, falsehoods and fraud -- is a ""worst practices"" list of things a true news organization should never, ever do.

O'Keefe has spent years attempting to expose alleged liberal bias in mainstream media organizations, which, in and of itself, is a worthy goal. Every member of a quality news organization -- editors, reporters, producers and executives -- should be prepared to explain and defend their work and methods: what stories we cover, how we do it and what assumptions or hidden biases might lie behind our choices.

But serious media critics have a responsibility, too, one that is equal to, if not greater than, the organizations they wish to expose. That means operating with honesty, fairness and good faith, taking care to back up accusations with concrete evidence.

But O'Keefe, whose website describes him as ""an award-winning journalist,"" is more partisan prankster than honest critic. Despite naming his organization Project Veritas (Latin for ""truth""), O'Keefe has frequently resorted to deceptive and occasionally illegal tactics, including the use of false identities , trespassing and selectively edited videos that have frequently been debunked",2017-11-30 00:00:00

(CNN) For years, newsrooms across America have had a problem with a lack of diversity and inclusion. People of color are underrepresented among news organizations, which do not reflect the makeup of the general population and have made little progress in the past decade.

Although non-whites make up about 40% of the US population, journalists of color comprise only 16.55% of newsrooms' staff in 2017, according to the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE) Newsroom Employment Diversity Survey.

Larger newsrooms and digital news organizations are a little better — 23.4% and 24.3%, respectively — but not much. People of color are only 13.4% of newsroom leaders.

This comes at a time when society needs and demands more inclusive news . It's been 190 years since the creation of the black press, and it's as relevant as ever.

In the absence of an inclusive environment, the quality of journalism suffers. Certain stories are simply not reported, or are told without the nuance or perspective the circumstances require. The black press has filled that void for generations. And with the advent of digital platforms, a baton has been passed to black millennial writers to continue presenting narratives, with underrepresented points of views, that would otherwise go missing -- and do not necessarily reflect the white men who dominate the industry.

Far beyond using social media for entertainment, shopping or communication, African-American millennials have elevated Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other platforms to raise public consciousness about the issues impacting black people. The hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #OscarsSoWhite are prime examples of this phenomenon.

According to Nielsen, 55% of black consumers between 18 and 34 spend at least an hour on social media each day, 6% higher than all millennials. In addition, 29% of black millennials spend three or more hours daily on social media sites, 9% higher than that of all millennials.

While black millennials fall below their counterparts in the percentage of leisure time spent on social media, they exceed the general millennial population in their overall presence on Twitter, Tumblr, Google+ and Whatsapp. That online presence has translated into the creation of a network of black news outlets specifically creating content that will meet readers and viewers where they are.

Additionally, when the mainstream media covers a particular issue, the black press may cover it with a completely different angle -- if not a different issue altogether. For example, the black press rejected the mainstream media narrative that white ""working class"" support for Trump was primarily economic in nature, reporting instead on the presidential candidate's appeal to white solidarity, raw racism and the scapegoating of minority groups.

After all, white economic angst by itself does not reconcile the fact that whites always have fared better than their African- and Latino-Americans. And while the mainstream news organizations have framed the NFL protests through the prism of patriotism and support for the military, the black press has focused on the crisis of police brutality and racial violence that underlie the athletes' decision to take a knee during the national anthem.

Fifty years ago, when unrest rocked cities across the nation as a result of police brutality and systemic racism, the Kerner Commission -- an 11-member commission appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson that highlighted racism for its role in a surge in urban riots -- took the news media to task.

""We have found a significant imbalance between what actually happened in our cities and what the newspaper, radio and television coverage of the riots told us happened,"" the Kerner report said

""Our second and fundamental criticism is that the news media have failed to analyze and report adequately on racial problems in the United States and, as a related matter, to meet the Negro's legitimate expectations in journalism. By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to both their black and white audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the sources of potential solutions.""

The Commission made a number of recommendations, including that news organizations employ black people beyond mere tokenism and in positions of real responsibility, and that they publish newspapers and produce programs that acknowledge black people, who they are and what they do.

Although newsrooms have made some progress, it's not where it should or needs to be. But by empowering themselves and their followers — without gatekeepers and intermediaries in the traditional media sense — young, black journalists have reached a broad audience. They can educate and mobilize others to act on a given issue, and connect with local, national and global social justice movements.

A videographer or documentarian can broadcast a crime in progress — such as a police beating of an unarmed motorist -- live and in real time, before an audience of thousands if not millions. In that regard, technology is the great equalizer, a check on the abuse of official power and a call to reform harmful patterns and discriminatory practices.

From its inception, the black press has been a change agent by shining a light on the plight of blacks and giving them the power to write and report on their own narratives. In New York in 1827, Rev. Samuel Cornish and John B. Russwurm began publication of Freedom's Journal, the first black-owned newspaper in America. Excluded from white venues and often insulted in their absence, black voices found the need to tell their own stories.

""We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us. Too long has the public been deceived by representations, in things which concern us dearly,"" wrote the editors in their first edition

Throughout the Civil War , black newspapers were centers for political debate on the war and emancipation, and advocacy for black soldiers. During Jim Crow and the reign of Klan terror, the black press fought against segregation, demanded equal rights for African Americans and helped elect politicians to office.

The Chicago Defender , which had demanded federal intervention from President Woodrow Wilson to stop lynchings, played a role in the Great Migration by urging a mass exodus of black people from the South.

In the 1890s, journalist Ida B. Wells led a campaign against lynching at considerable personal risk. Born a slave, she wrote about the injustices of racial segregation in the South. A mob descended upon her Memphis news office, destroyed her equipment and threatened her with death.

Over the years, many black publications disappeared. Others learned to navigate the new landscape, and a plethora of new black media emerged with a strictly online presence, impacting the manner that black people digest and make sense of the news.

The days of ""reading the paper"" are long gone for many, but what remains the same is that the black press doesn't look like the theoretical textbook case of objective journalism -- and it was never meant to be -- whatever that means to you.

When narratives are told from the perspective of a black lens, perhaps there are no two sides to a story. Perhaps there is only one side, or numerous sides with various textures and shades. What is certain is there is a sense of responsibility to the community, advocating for that community and telling their stories from their perspective.

A digital environment arms African-American millennial writers with tools that enable them to carve out their own territory in their unique and innovative way -- exercising free speech and contributing to a healthy democracy, and staying true to the proud history of the black press.",2017-11-30 00:00:00
Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,"Suzanne Nossel is executive director of PEN America. She was formerly executive director of Amnesty International USA and deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations at the State Department. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) RT -- the Kremlin-funded news channel formerly known as ""Russia Today,"" frequently cited as a central gear in Russia's propaganda machine -- is nothing if not colorful. The network is known for declaring the Boston Marathon bombings a government plot , publicly shaming its own journalists if they dare defy the Kremlin line and for featuring American commentators known for conspiracy-mongering.

Following years of hue and cry over the network's overt pro-Kremlin bias, earlier this month the Department of Justice forced the channel to file under the ""Foreign Agents Registration Act,"" or FARA , a 1938 law that was initially passed to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and subsequently retooled in the 1960s to publicly pinpoint those lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.

Forcing RT to register as a foreign agent is justified, but isn't the best way to counter the propaganda the channel -- or any other source of disinformation for that matter -- puts out. While RT has howled its objections, the network may protest too much. Absent a far wider effort to incentivize and enable news consumers to distinguish serious news and analysis from agitprop, FARA registration or not, the influence of RT and other shady news sources may survive intact.

The problem is that while RT's FARA registration may make members of Congress and administration officials feel as though they've landed a blow in the fight against Russian propaganda, RT's filing with the Justice Department may well never register with most news consumers. From the looks of things there is no easy way for a consumer of RT to learn that it has filed as a foreign agent. It is not mentioned in the ""About Us"" section of RT nor flagged on RT stories that appear in Google searches. The same is true of the China Daily News, a media outlet long registered under FARA as an agent of the Chinese government.

News cognoscenti are already well aware of RT's lineage, but to get through to those who read and believe the network will require more than the fine print in a government filing.

Former FBI Director James Comey put it bluntly in testimony last March before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying, ""The Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda.""

In late October Twitter announced that it would ""off-board"" all advertising from RT and Sputnik, another Russian-controlled platform, based on its own investigation and on US intelligence agencies' conclusion that the networks had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election at Putin's behest.

Whereas FARA contains an exception for bona fide media organizations, those state-owned entities that have qualified for it -- including the BBC and Germany's Deutsche Welle -- have strong layers of publicly visible and reputable independent governance that shield editorial decision-making from government interference.

While critics have been hard-pressed to argue that RT does not meet the criteria for registration under the act, they have rightly pointed out that by enforcing its provisions against the network, the US will likely trigger a wave of retaliatory and copycat measures designed by governments to clamp down on media outlets considered unfriendly. Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week. Russia's Ministry of Justice has let US government-backed networks, including Voice of American and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) know that they may be required to register under the new act. Russia is also reportedly considering more sweeping bans on the availability of foreign print media.

In some ways, these new measures are old news: US government-backed VOA and RFE/RL have been blocked from broadcasting in Russia for years. The more worrying prospect is that repressive regimes elsewhere in the world -- think the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte or Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov -- are emboldened in acting to foster local distrust of credible international media outlets.

With consumers accessing the vast majority of their news via Facebook and other social media feeds, the likelihood that news of RT's filing will color the reception of its stories among those who currently tune in seems dim. Tangible indicators of likely veracity -- including information about the news source, its track record, ethical guidelines and reporting methods -- can be ferreted out only through time-consuming research, if at all. A study earlier this year by the Media Insight Project revealed that consumers are far more likely to evaluate the veracity of a news article based on who shared it than what the source is.

If anything, worries about RT's influence point to the fact that transparency in American news media consumption cannot come solely, or even primarily, through force of law. Rather, we need Americans to be trained and educated to expect and demand transparency about ownership, editorial control, potential conflicts of interest and internal checks and processes to preserve objectivity and accuracy from the news that we consume. And, if outlets insist on remaining opaque on these fronts, as has RT, we should know to reject those outlets as unreliable.

We should prize voluntary transparency by news outlets, and should refuse to pay for, devote our attention to, do business with and share information from outlets unwilling to be transparent. As primary conduits for news, social media platforms have an essential role to play in equipping and empowering users to get the information they need to make sound judgments about what they're reading and sharing.

In an open media ecosystem, especially as one as large and freewheeling as the internet, government regulation is never going to be a satisfactory answer for the scourge of fraudulent news or propaganda.

Ultimately, the best defense against fake news and foreign propaganda lies in comprehensive public education on the uses and misuses of media. News literacy curricula in schools and workplaces, easier-to-use reference material tied to news shared online, transparent newsroom policies on subjects like conflicts of interest and corrections and rigorous methods of sourcing and crediting are all essential to enabling news consumers to navigate the information ocean in which many now drown.

It is true that Americans are fiercely independent in choosing what media to consume and credit. But no one wants to be fooled. Rather than consoling ourselves that RT's motives and loyalties will now be laid bare, the network's belated registration under FARA is just one more reminder that absent more far-reaching action, purveyors of propaganda and fraudulent news will likely continue to work their will on a populace that is ill-equipped to defend itself.",2017-11-30 00:00:00
Student journalists deserve a free press too,"Attorney Frank D. LoMonte is a professor of media law at the University of Florida, where he runs the Brechner Center for Freedom of Information . As the executive director of the Student Press Law Center from 2008 until August 2017, he launched the ""New Voices"" initiative to enact laws protecting student journalism. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his. This is the latest installment in CNN Opinion's series on the challenges facing the media as it is under attack from critics, governments and changing technology.

(CNN) When a California judge entered an unlawful order sealing an entire lawsuit file -- including, bizarrely, even the court order imposing the seal -- outraged journalists took action to defend the public's right to know.

With the help of volunteer legal counsel, reporters Anumita Jain and Armaan Rashid filed a petition in a Contra Costa County court to unseal the case file, which involves a school district's decision to discipline a Danville student over a homemade social-media video said to depict Arabs as terrorists. The school district's decision to remove the student as president of the student government association as punishment for the video -- and then restore him to the position after a public outcry -- dominated two local school board meetings, but without access to the court file, the details of the case (including the contents of the video) remain a puzzle to the community.

There's nothing especially novel about the case -- except that the journalists are themselves in high school , staff members of the Wildcat Tribune newspaper that has provided the community's most thorough and reliable coverage of the lawsuit and the controversy behind it.

""As journalists, Rashid and Jani are attempting to discharge their duties in the highest and best ethical tradition by obtaining direct access to first-hand documentation about a news event,"" says their motion to unseal the file, which is awaiting a ruling in Contra Costa County Superior Court.

That high school journalists are capable of work rivaling that of professionals, and that they have taken the lead in battling a lack of government transparency, should come as no surprise to anyone. Some of the best journalism in America today is coming out of student-run outlets, as demonstrated by the acclaimed investigative reporting of a team at Kansas' Pittsburg High School, who so painstakingly discredited their newly hired principal's inflated resumé that she was forced to resign.

It may come as more of a surprise to learn that in many ways, this dedication is more the rule than the exception. Student journalists are, increasingly, the information lifeline for their communities. With employment in traditional newsrooms hitting historic lows , down 42% since 1990, the public is more reliant than ever on students to sound the alarm if schools are unsafe or ineffective -- or if there's any story unfolding on their campus that could affect their community. Education news now accounts for just 1.4% of the time and space in mainstream media outlets, according to a 2009 study by the Brookings Institution. It's up to students to fill that information void -- if their schools will let them.

High schools often nurture the mentality that students have a ""civic duty"" to say only favorable things about the education they're receiving. ""Be true to your school"" is a nice enough idea -- but you won't find it in the Constitution. ""Citizens will be punished if they question or criticize the government"" isn't a sentiment that belongs in any American educational institution. As a lawyer assisting students in censorship cases, I once had a school superintendent in Tennessee tell me that a student's political column was rejected because it ""might cause passionate conversations"" -- as if passionate conversations about politics were a distraction from learning and not central to it.

Regrettably, for every student in a well-supported journalism program at a secondary school empowered to use media to right wrongs, there is another student who's been bullied and silenced by image-obsessed school authorities whose highest priority is avoiding controversy, not providing a quality education.

In Flushing, New York, for example , a principal refused to print an entire edition of the Advocate newspaper in spring 2017 because of a column that captured students' honest assessment of the shortcomings of Flushing High School (in particular, one student's comment that ""out of my 8 classes, only 3 of my teachers really care."")

In Omaha, Nebraska, school authorities retaliated against the Pawprint student news outlet at Millard West High School for a factually accurate article questioning the propriety of some (unnamed) teachers' classroom criticisms of President Trump. First, they pulled the article offline. Then, after relenting in the face of a potential First Amendment lawsuit, they removed a well-credentialed faculty adviser from her job -- just weeks after her students won the best-in-state award for the newspaper she advised.

In the Chicago suburb of Steinmetz in 2016, a high school principal ordered the student newspaper shuttered and the journalism program canceled in mid-semester after a student reporter defied his orders not to write on her personal off-campus blog about a controversy over changing the starting time of the school day. (The school district ultimately overruled the decision after private benefactors stepped forward to volunteer to pay for printing the newspaper.)

While it seems outrageous for schools to use their power over students for purposes of public relations or image maintenance, it's not clear that it's illegal.

In a 1988 ruling, Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier , the US Supreme Court stripped students of all meaningful constitutional protection when they use a school-provided publication or platform to convey their speech. The Hazelwood decision was widely denounced by First Amendment scholars at the time, and it hasn't aged well -- imagine, in 2017, trying to prevent high school students from learning about teen pregnancy by yanking pages out of newspapers, as the principal of Hazelwood East High School did -- but it endures as a stain on the lawbooks. In the 30 years since, there is only one documented case of a high school journalist successfully challenging school censorship in court, a 2004 case in which a Michigan student was prevented from publishing a truthful article about a lawsuit against her school because the school didn't want to call public attention to the case.

Fortunately, help is on the way. Increasingly, state legislators are recognizing the unique educational value of student journalism and stepping up to protect the journalists that Hazelwood left vulnerable.

California and Kansas were among the first states to embrace press freedom in schools, and it's no coincidence that the courageous public-service journalism being done in Danville and Pittsburg isn't being seen in Flushing or in Omaha.

Thirteen states from coast-to-coast now protect student journalism against image-motivated censorship, and bills are anticipated in at least a half-dozen other states in 2018.

The case for protecting press freedom in schools isn't just about training future journalists. It's about developing inquisitive, participatory citizens willing to ask the hard questions of government authorities that involved citizenship demands.

It's also about rooting out systemic inequality. Research by University of Kansas scholars documents that censorship is a pervasive problem in high school newsrooms -- and that it disproportionately affects young women.

More than half of all female students surveyed during the 2015 school year reported that they'd ""self-censored"" from pursuing a story, anticipating an adverse reaction from school authorities -- a rate twice that of male students. And more than one-third of all students said they'd been categorically banned from talking about certain topics in student media. (The most frequently forbidden subject? Unthinkably, in the midst of an epidemic of opioid fatalities, it's substance abuse.)

Kansas journalism professor Peter Bobkowski, co-leader of the survey, has documented the civic-education benefits of working in a student newsroom where First Amendment principles are honored. After separately surveying 900 high school journalists across a variety of schools in Kansas and Missouri, Bobkowski found that students whose journalistic work is respected and valued develop greater confidence (what he calls ""civic efficacy"") in their ability to use their voices to make social and political change.

It's fashionable to point fingers at social-justice-drunk ""snowflakes"" for devaluing the First Amendment in higher education, but that misses the point. Students arriving on America's college campuses have largely spent the formative years of their educational lives watching fundamental constitutional principles devalued and their rights and voices routinely disregarded without consequence by respected authority figures.

It's no mystery why students believe it's the government's job to protect them from offensive speech: the Supreme Court told them in Hazelwood that the government's interest in avoiding political controversy is more important than freedom of the press, and they've lived that reality every day of their K-12 lives. The erosion of First Amendment values will be reversed only when schools reopen their doors to the ""passionate conversations"" that effective civic learning requires.",2017-11-29 00:00:00
Media martyrs: Among those who died while working as journalists in the past 15 years,"Daniel Pearl

Daniel Pearl was the South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, based in Mumbai, India. Pearl was reportedly on his way to an interview in Karachi, Pakistan for a story about the “shoe bomber,” Richard Reid, when he was kidnapped on January 23, 2002. Investigators say he was led into a trap, believing he was to meet with Sheikh Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani. His captors demanded better conditions for prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay and threatened to kill Pearl if the demands weren’t met. Pearl was killed sometime between the end of January and early February, though the US government only confirmed Pearl’s beheading on February 21, 2002. Four men were convicted in the case. Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-born Islamic militant, was sentenced to death, while the other three were given life terms. In 2016, the Pakistani military thwarted a plot to free Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, as suspected mastermind of the 9/11 attacks being held by the United States, has said he personally killed Pearl.",

The worst of Trump's pardons (opinion),"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) In his final full day in office, President Donald Trump refrained from the most outrageous possible abuses of the pardon power. Perhaps wary of causing political backlash, given his impending Senate impeachment trial, Trump has not pardoned himself, his children or his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

But make no mistake: With his final batch of 73 pardons and 70 sentence commutations, Trump offered up one last burst of cronyism and self-dealing. While Trump issued pardons to several recipients whose cases had been rightly advocated by criminal justice reform groups, he also doled out free passes to an unseemly lineup of criminals who apparently have been granted mercy based largely on their personal connections to Trump, their wealth and access or their status as celebrity objects of fascination.

This is, needless to say, not how pardons are supposed to work. The best way to understand Trump's abuse of the pardon power is by comparing his actions to those of his immediate predecessors. President Barack Obama issued far more pardons and commutations than Trump has. But the vast majority of Obama's grants of leniency went to nonviolent drug offenders who had received harsh prison sentences and to whom Obama had no personal or political connections -- while Trump's pardons have gone largely to his own political and personal allies and other well-connected recipients.

President George W. Bush wrote that he was taken aback by the last-minute blitz of pardon requests from well-connected individuals during his final days in office. Bush resolved not to grant any such requests but rather to consider only those pardon applications that had been vetted by the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney (who traditionally provides nonbinding guidance to the President to ensure that pardons are properly vetted and equitable). In contrast, Trump has largely ignored the pardon attorney.

Here's a rundown of the most odious of the pardons and commutations that Trump granted in his final hours, in his own version of Pardongate:

Steve Bannon. Bannon brazenly Bannon brazenly ripped off Trump's own most ardent followers who donated to a scam called ""We Build the Wall,"" federal prosecutors said. Bannon allegedly defrauded donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars they'd given to that fund and used the money for his own lavish personal lifestyle. Now, Trump has let Bannon off the hook, while hanging his own most fervent supporters out to dry.

Elliott Broidy. The former Republican Party and Trump fundraiser The former Republican Party and Trump fundraiser pleaded guilty to secretly lobbying the US government on behalf of Chinese and Malaysian interests. The Justice Department previously had declared that Broidy's conduct ""poses a serious threat to our national security and undermines the integrity of our democracy."" He, too, gets a free pass.

Kwame Kilpatrick. The infamously The infamously corrupt former mayor of Detroit had his sentence commuted by the President because, according to the White House news release, he ""has taught public speaking classes and has led Bible Study groups with his fellow inmates."" That's it. That's the entire rationale.

Paul Erickson. Convicted of wire fraud and money laundering as an offshoot of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Erickson received a pardon seemingly solely because his case had some connection to Mueller. The White House news release focuses not on Erickson's conduct (""a minor financial crime,"" it said) but solely on the specious and overwrought claim that this ""pardon helps right the wrongs of what has been revealed to be perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American History.""

The closest comparison for Trump's endgame pardon blitz happened on President Bill Clinton's last day in office in January 2001, when Clinton doled out over 130 pardons to a group that included his personal and political allies, political donors and his own half-brother. Clinton's actions became known as Pardongate and prompted a federal criminal investigation (which did not result in charges). We'll see if Trump's closing flurry of pardons will bring a similar response.

Now, your questions:

Gary (New Mexico): Can the Senate hold an impeachment trial after the president leaves office on January 20?

Yes. There is historical precedent for impeaching and trying a federal official after he has left office. On March 2, 1876, Secretary of War William Belknap resigned under political pressure. Later that day, the House impeached Belknap. Then, in August 1876, the Senate held Belknap's impeachment trial (and ultimately acquitted him).

Common sense leads to the same result. Article I of the Constitution permits Congress to disqualify an officer from holding future office. What happens, then, if a president commits an egregious act on his last full day in office, January 19? There would not be time to impeach and formally try and convict that president before he leaves office at noon the next day. So, the only practical way to effectuate the Constitution's disqualification provision is by holding impeachment proceedings after the president has left office.

Jack (Michigan): Can the President still issue pardons, even now that he has been impeached?

Yes, but the confusion here is understandable. Article II of the Constitution provides that the President ""shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment."" The language here is ambiguous. Read one way, it could appear to say that after the President is impeached by the House, he loses the power to issue pardons. But read another way, it says that the President can issue pardons for criminal offenses but not for impeachment.

The latter reading is correct. There is no provision anywhere in the Constitution, statutes or case law that strips a President of any power solely upon impeachment by the House (though, of course, if convicted in the Senate, the President loses the office and all of its powers).

It would be anomalous for the President to lose only one power -- the power to pardon -- upon impeachment alone. Indeed, all three Presidents who have been impeached -- Andrew Johnson Bill Clinton and Trump (the first time) -- issued many pardons after their impeachments.

Rather, the clause in Article II means that while a President can pardon an official (or any person) for a crime, he cannot pardon an official out of impeachment. In other words, the President does not have power to un-impeach.",2021-01-20 00:00:00
Something went terribly wrong with Trump's defense (Opinion),"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) Just over a week before the start of his second impeachment trial, former President Donald Trump's entire legal team has walked away . What already promised to be an unpredictable and unprecedented show on the Senate floor just got even messier, as it appears that Trump will insist on repeating the same dangerous lie that sparked the Capitol riot -- that the election was stolen from him -- and led to his (second) impeachment in the first place.

Here's what we know. The mass resignations of all five of Trump's lawyers show us something has gone terribly wrong on the defense team. And these lawyers were no hacks -- several of them are Justice Department alums , and the (former) lead attorney, Butch Bowers, was a government ethics specialist . They would not abandon a client this close to trial without darn good reason.

Any defense attorney holds a broad obligation to represent his or her client zealously. That's a crucial part of our adversarial justice system. But there are limits on what a defense attorney can argue. For example, per the American Bar Association , it would be unethical for any attorney to raise an argument ""that he knows to be false."" The ""rigged election"" narrative certainly fits that description.

It's telling that the source of the falling-out between Trump and his (former) lawyers was his insistence that they raise the ""stolen election"" defense. Trump's defenders certainly could have argued in good faith and within ethical boundaries that it is unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a former president, or that Trump's actions were protected political speech under the First Amendment. I disagree with both of these arguments on the merits, but Trump and his attorneys certainly would have been within their rights to make these claims before the Senate. But the ""stolen election"" argument crosses a line.

What happens next? I see three possibilities. One, Trump could find a new legal team. Time is absurdly short; typically, even in a routine criminal trial, the legal teams would be in endgame crunch-time mode by now -- never mind for a historic impeachment proceeding. But whoever does take on this representation should understand that, if he actually raises the ""stolen election"" defense, he does so at his own professional and reputational risk. The ""stolen election"" lie fueled the Capitol insurrection on January 6 and repeating it now from the well of the Senate only threatens to provoke more unrest.

Trump also could choose to represent himself. This is extremely unlikely but legally possible. Criminal defendants can and at times do elect to represent themselves -- it's called ""pro se,"" in the Latin legalese -- and there's no technical reason Trump can't do the same at impeachment. But do not count on this happening.

Or Trump could elect not to defend himself at all. There is nothing in the law that requires a person facing impeachment to have any legal representation. Trump could, in essence, choose to sit this one out, and to rely on Republican senators to make the case for him on the floor. Given last week's vote by 45 senators to consider a motion on the constitutionality of trying a former president -- which signaled, but did not necessarily lock in, support for Trump by those who voted to hear the motion (more on this below) -- Trump might choose to sit back and hope that at least 34 of those senators vote to acquit. Convicting an impeached official requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate.

We are, once again, in uncharted territory with Trump. His stubborn insistence on continuing to promote the dangerous election fraud lie caused the Capitol insurrection has now cost him his legal team. And if he continues to press that lie, it could cost him -- and the country -- even more.

Now, your questions:

Linda (Florida): In the impeachment trial, can the senators cast their votes confidentially?

Technically, the Senate can choose to vote in secret, but it almost certainly won't. The Senate generally makes its own procedures for impeachment by majority vote; however, there is a separate provision of the US Constitution that enables the Senate to hold any vote publicly if so requested by one-fifth of all senators (20 of the 100 senators). It seems virtually certain that, even if the secrecy issue did arise, at least 20 senators would vote to hold the impeachment vote publicly. Count on seeing every senator stand up in the well at the end of trial and declaring his or her verdict, guilty or not guilty.

Adam (New York): Given last week's vote by 45 Republican senators about the constitutionality of trying a former president, is there any chance the Senate still convicts President Trump?

Yes. Last week, Sen. Rand Paul made a motion on the Senate floor to consider his argument that it is unconstitutional to try a former president. (I believe he's wrong, as I explained here.)

Fifty-five senators (all 50 Democrats plus five Republicans) voted to ""table"" (essentially, to put off) the motion, while 45 senators (all Republican) voted to hear the motion.

A Trump representative has claimed that, ""In fact, 45 senators have already voted that it is unconstitutional."" But that's wrong. Those 45 senators voted only to hear debate on and consider the motion, but not on its ultimate merits. In fact, at least two of the 45 senators, John Thune and Rob Portman, have publicly stated that their votes to hear Paul's motion do not mean they will necessarily vote to acquit Trump. To be sure, the vote on Paul's motion does signal that many and perhaps all of the 45 senators are inclined toward acquitting Trump, but it does not guarantee any such outcome.",2021-01-31 00:00:00
Justice for George Floyd gets a step closer,"In this weekly column ""Cross Exam,"" Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, gives his take on the latest legal news. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.

(CNN) Wednesday's charges against Derek Chauvin and three other former Minneapolis Police Department officers involved in the death of George Floyd are an important step toward justice. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison did the right thing, and the necessary thing, by upgrading the top charge against Chauvin, and by bringing serious charges against the other three officers as well.

County-level prosecutors originally charged Chauvin last week with third-degree murder, in a complaint that was rife with subtly inexplicable statements and omissions. Third-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and requires proof that the defendant committed an act ""eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life."" In other words, a third-degree charge requires prosecutors to show that Chauvin acted recklessly and dangerously, without necessarily intending to kill Floyd.

Ellison took over the case shortly thereafter, reportedly at ""the urging of Floyd's family, community activists, and some members of the Minneapolis City Council,"" and now he has addressed a shortcoming in the original complaint by charging Chauvin with a more serious second-degree murder count, which carries a potential 40-year sentence. Ellison used a smart tactic here by charging what is known as ""felony murder."" That means the defendant intentionally committed some felony -- here, assault -- and that a death resulted. Thus, prosecutors need to prove that Chauvin intentionally assaulted Floyd, but not necessarily that Chauvin intended to kill him.

The publicly-available evidence looks sufficient to sustain this charge. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including three full minutes after Floyd stopped moving and nearly two minutes after he apparently ""ceas[ed] to breathe or speak."" During the full eight-plus minutes, Floyd audibly stated, ""I can't breathe,"" ""mama,"" ""Don't kill me,"" and ""I'm about to die."" I believe that evidence is sufficient to show an intentional killing -- and all the prosecution must establish here is an intentional assault, with death resulting.

As a safety net, prosecutors also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

Opinion: The most devastating piece of evidence at the Trump trial,"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) At the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, there is no real dispute about what actually happened. Trump's effort to undermine the legitimacy of the November election, his inflammatory words to the crowd on the Ellipse in Washington, DC, on January 6, and the violent attack on the Capitol by many of his most ardent supporters -- they're all memorialized, on video, for the world to see.

Elie Honig

Trump's lawyers can't change what happened on that day, or before. Instead, they are trying to make the case all about Trump's subjective intent, which can be less tangible and more difficult to discern. Trump's lawyers have argued that he did not intend for the attack to occur and, they claim in their pretrial brief , he was ""horrified"" at what he saw his supporters doing inside the Capitol.

But House impeachment managers have one devastating piece of evidence that decisively refutes Trump's attorneys' claim about their client's state of mind: Trump's tweet January 6 at around 6 p.m.

In the tweet -- sent hours after the Capitol insurrection had occurred and since deleted by Twitter -- Trump wrote: ""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!""

Ask yourself: Are those the words of a person who was genuinely ""horrified"" by what he saw, to quote Trump's attorneys? To the contrary, in my view, the tweet establishes beyond any real doubt that Trump was pleased at what his supporters had done. He called them ""great patriots,"" and urged them to ""(r)emember this day forever!"" Those are unequivocal words of empathy with the mob -- even exultation -- not regret.

Opinion: The three biggest decisions facing Merrick Garland,"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) This week, Judge Merrick Garland will finally get a confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, more than four years after his nomination to the US Supreme Court was torpedoed by Sen. Mitch McConnell's obstructionism. Of course, this time Garland has been nominated as President Joe Biden's attorney general, and, with Senate Democrats in the majority, his swift confirmation is all but assured.

If all goes as planned and Garland takes the reins at the Justice Department, he will face a daunting thicket of quandaries that present thorny issues of law, accountability and politics.

Garland will bring impressive credentials to the attorney general position. Unlike the former Attorney General William Barr, Garland earned his stripes as a trial prosecutor for the Justice Department. Among many other cases, Garland supervised the investigation of the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, which killed more than 160 people, and the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta. In 1997, he became a federal appellate judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, widely regarded as the second most important court in the country, behind only the Supreme Court. Garland became chief judge of the circuit in 2013.

It will take all of Garland's legal experience and political acumen to negotiate the complex decisions an attorney general will face. Here are the most important decisions that Garland will likely make at the Justice Department headquarters.

Former President Donald Trump investigations

Trump was acquitted in both impeachment trials, first on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in 2020 stemming from his phone calls with the Ukrainian president and then on a charge of inciting an insurrection a year later. Now that he's left office, however, Trump could face potential legal exposure across multiple fronts, including (1) bribery , extortion and other alleged offenses relating to the Ukraine scandal, and (2) incitement of a riot, sedition and other potential charges relating to the January 6 Capitol insurrection. He could also face legal trouble when it comes to (3) obstruction of justice of former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and (4) campaign finance violations based on hush money payments to two women with whom Trump allegedly had affairs, (Trump denies wrongdoing on all of these potential charges.)

Will Garland authorize the Justice Department to open and pursue criminal investigations on some or all of these matters? Will he appoint a special counsel to focus solely on Trump-related matters? Will he dole these cases out to various US attorneys? Or, will Garland do nothing at all and let the past lie?

This last option would be a mistake. I understand that it's not an easy thing to investigate a former president, and even more difficult to prosecute one. Trump, who retains the fervent support of tens of millions of Americans, would likely break out the old attack lines against anybody who dared to investigate him (""witch hunt!"") and any prosecution would be perceived by some as politically vindictive.

But it would simply be unjust to turn a blind eye to all of Trump's alleged misconduct while running for, and holding, the presidency. Trump benefited while in office from the Justice Department's policy against indicting a sitting president, and there is no question, legally or constitutionally, that a former president can be charged criminally.

I understand why it might be easier for Garland and the Justice Department, and perhaps preferable for Biden politically, to just let the past be the past and to ""move on."" But that's not what prosecutors do, or ought to do. Prosecutors shouldn't shy away from difficult fights; the job itself is often about taking on powerful people or interests and seeing that justice is done.

At a minimum, Garland must ensure that the Justice Department conducts full investigations of Trump's conduct. And once he gets all the facts, he must make a decision, thumbs-up or thumbs-down, on whether Trump has broken the law.

Hunter Biden investigations

Hunter Biden has revealed publicly that he is under criminal investigation by federal authorities for his ""tax affairs"" and reportedly for his business dealings in China. The US attorneys for the District of Delaware and the Southern District of New York are reportedly handling the Biden investigations.

Despite pressure from Trump, neither Barr nor his successor appointed a special counsel to handle the investigations of Biden's son. Biden issued a statement saying, ""I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately.""

What, then, should Garland do about this potentially politically loaded investigation? My answer is: nothing. Let it be. Let the assigned federal prosecutors and law enforcement agents carry out their investigations fully, and without interference, influence or input from the attorney general's suite. Make no public comment about the investigation and convey nothing to the assigned investigative teams other than: ""Do your jobs and report back."" And let them make recommendations about whether the evidence, once gathered, does or does not support criminal charges. So far, the Biden administration, which has begun the process of removing Trump-appointed US attorneys, has asked US Attorney David Weiss, who is overseeing the tax investigation of Hunter Biden in Delaware, to continue in his role, according to a Bloomberg report

John Durham investigation

Before he left office, Barr appointed Durham as special counsel, effectively ensuring that Durham's work will continue until its natural conclusion (though Barr's timing — more than a year after Durham began his work — was suspect, and the appointment itself violated the requirement that special counsel must come from outside the government, a fact nobody has ever formally challenged).

Again, Garland's best, and perhaps only (given the special counsel assignment) option is to let the Durham investigation play out, without interference. And, unlike Barr, who publicly distorted Mueller's findings as special counsel, Garland should allow Durham's report to speak for itself in the public realm.

More broadly than any particular case, Garland must rehabilitate the Justice Department after nearly two years of unprecedented politicization and dishonesty by Trump and Barr. To that end, Garland simply must bring the Justice Department back to basics: be honest with the public, keep politics out of prosecution and support the men and women who work on the front lines.

Now, your questions

Gary (Michigan): If Trump is someday convicted of a crime, can he still legally run for president again in 2024?

Yes. Article II of the Constitution establishes certain restrictions on who may hold the office of president: the person must be at least 35 years old, must be a ""natural born citizen"" and must have been a resident of the United States for at least 14 years. There is nothing in the Constitution, or in any other legal authority, to prevent a person from becoming president if he has been convicted of a crime. As a practical matter, of course, a criminal conviction would make it difficult to win an election. But there is no formal restriction under our laws.

Gerry (Rhode Island): Can civil charges be brought against Trump for his role in the January 6 insurrection?

They already have. Last week, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson brought a lawsuit under the obscure Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, alleging that Trump, Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers conspired to use violence and threats to interfere with governmental functions. While the merits of the case remain to be litigated, I expect to see other, more conventional lawsuits seeking damages for personal injury and property damage brought against Trump and perhaps others relating to the Capitol insurrection.

Generally speaking, a plaintiff would need to show by a ""preponderance"" of the evidence — meaning that it is more likely than not — that Trump's actions (or the actions of any named defendant) caused their injuries, and that those injuries were reasonably foreseeable based on the defendant's conduct. In other words, if you played a videotape of Trump's remarks at the January 6 rally, and then hit pause, would it be reasonably foreseeable at that point that injury would result to the plaintiffs?",2021-02-21 00:00:00
Opinion: Could Trump derail his impeachment trial?,"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) Once again, Donald Trump has thrown the legal and political system into uncharted waters. This time, the novel question is this: Can the US Senate try and convict a former president? While there is some disagreement among legal scholars, the answer must be yes, both as a matter of law and common sense.

The issue already has caused a split within the Republican Party. Several Republican senators have come out against trying a former president , while Sen. Mitt Romney and a group of former Republican officials and lawyers have taken the contrary position. Democrats appear to be united in favor of trying the former President.

First and foremost: This has happened before. On March 2, 1876, Secretary of War William Belknap resigned under political pressure after a House committee uncovered evidence of corruption. Later that day, the House impeached him on charges of ""criminally disregarding his duty as Secretary of War and basely prostituting his high office to his lust for private gain.""

The Senate held Belknap's impeachment trial in August 1876 (and ultimately acquitted him). Granted, Belknap was a non-presidential official, but that distinction carries no particular legal or logical significance. And of course, 1876 was a long time ago -- but the legal principle is the same.

Former federal judge J. Michael Luttig, a leading proponent of the argument that a former president cannot be impeached or tried, has argued (in largely conclusory fashion) that ""the Senate's only power under the Constitution is to convict -- or not -- an incumbent president."" But I believe that Luttig is wrong. Article I of the Constitution specifically empowers the Senate to do two separate things: remove a convicted official from his position and disqualify an official from holding future federal office. The latter punishment still could apply to a former officeholder like Trump.

Indeed, it would defy common sense if the Senate were powerless to hold a former president accountable through impeachment and trial. If that were the case, the end days of any president's term could devolve into a zero-consequence free-for-all, once it became impracticable for the Senate to complete an impeachment proceeding before the natural end of tenure on January 20.

And if the Senate actually were powerless to impeach or try an official who has left office, then the constitutional disqualification power would be rendered effectively moot. Any official facing near-certain conviction could simply resign from office before the Senate impeached him and imposed the disqualification penalty, and then run for office again at will.

But the merits of the argument about whether a former president can be impeached and tried are only the starting point. Things get really messy when we consider how a legal challenge might play out.

First and foremost, who might formally decide the issue? It seems clear that if the Senate itself decides, the trial will go forward, given that Democrats currently control the Senate (and at least one Republican, Sen. Romney, agrees with their position).

But Trump himself, or perhaps a group of Republican senators, could try to appeal the issue to the federal courts. If that happens, then the first question is, which court gets the case first? It seems unlikely that the case could go directly to the US Supreme Court, which has ""original jurisdiction"" only over disputes involving two or more states or cases involving ambassadors or other ""public ministers."" Neither applies here.

In the fastest-moving scenario, the case could start in the federal district (trial-level) court and skip the intermediate court of appeals under an obscure rule that allows direct appeal to the Supreme Court. The rule applies only if the court decides that ""the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice"" and ""require(s) immediate determination.""

In that situation, time would be tight. The substantive portion of the Senate trial is set to begin in two weeks, on February 9. Even if a legal challenge reaches the courts tomorrow, it would be a tight squeeze to get resolution before February 9. And if Trump (or another party raising a challenge) files a lawsuit even closer to February 9, things get even more difficult. If a lawsuit is pending on February 9, does the Senate hold off and await a court decision? Or does the Senate plow ahead in the absence of a final ruling?

Beyond the complications of a timing issue lies the difficult question of whether the federal courts would even agree to rule on the case at all. On one hand, the issue is of monumental importance, and the Constitution itself is ambiguous enough to call out for a definitive ruling. On the other hand, federal courts tend to avoid ruling on what they deem ""political questions,"" preferring instead to leave such issues to political actors in other branches of government.

Keep an eye on this dispute. Its resolution could complicate, or even derail, Trump's upcoming impeachment trial. But if the Senate -- and potentially the courts -- reach the proper conclusion, Trump's trial will proceed and a clear message will be sent: Abuse of power, even during a president's final days in office, simply cannot be tolerated.

Now, your questions:

Steve (Washington): Could President Trump's effort to use the Justice Department to overturn the Georgia election results be relevant evidence in the Senate impeachment trial?

Legal questions of the week Got questions about the week's legal news? Elie Honig will be responding on Fridays. Send your questions to: CNN.Opinion@turner.com.

Yes. The Article of Impeachment voted by the House of Representatives focuses primarily on the Capitol insurrection of January 6. But it also specifically encompasses the events leading up to the insurrection, including Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to swing the state's election outcome to Trump.

Consistent with that allegation, the House impeachment managers could decide to introduce as evidence recent revelations about Trump's effort to pressure Justice Department officials to assist in his effort to overturn the results of the Georgia election. The argument would be that Trump's pressure campaign on DOJ was part and parcel of his larger effort to steal the election as a whole, which inevitably culminated with the January 6 Capitol attack.

Angelo (Illinois): How much legal authority does a president have to undo the executive orders of a prior president?

President Biden has used his power to issue executive orders aggressively during his first days in office to enact new policies relating to immigration, environmental policy and other issues.

Opinion: Impeaching Trump isn't enough,"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) Impeachment of President Donald Trump is necessary but not enough. Conviction, too, is amply warranted but still insufficient. Congress must take that final step and use its rarely invoked constitutional power to disqualify Trump from ever again holding federal office.

If ever a case cried out for application of the disqualification power, this is it: the President of the United States inciting a mob that ransacked parts of the Capitol and resulted in five deaths

The Constitution provides that, upon impeachment in the US House of Representatives (by majority vote) and conviction in the US Senate (by two-thirds vote), an official can be punished with ""removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States."" Under Senate precedent , disqualification requires a separate vote, after and only if they have voted to convict. And while a two-thirds vote is necessary to convict, the Senate has previously used a lower standard -- a simple majority -- to disqualify. Over its history, the Senate has convicted and disqualified only three officeholders, including the last person who was impeached before Trump, federal Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. in 2010.

The disqualification power, though rarely invoked, is particularly relevant here because of the calendar. Ordinarily, impeachment and conviction carry a heavy penalty: forfeiture of a president's remaining term in office. But because Trump's effort to inflame his followers to storm the Capitol crested on January 6 -- exactly two weeks before the end of his tenure -- there is little practical chance that the House can impeach and the Senate can hold a trial and convict before the natural end of his term on January 20.

So disqualification likely will be the only real way to impose tangible punishment.

Indeed, the Constitution and historical precedent appear to permit the Senate to try a federal official after he leaves office. This has happened once before. On March 2, 1876, Secretary of War William Belknap resigned under political pressure; later that day, the House impeached him. Then, in August 1876, the Senate held Belknap's impeachment trial (and ultimately acquitted him).

There undoubtedly is a punitive aspect to disqualification; it is necessary to deter treacherous conduct even in the final days and hours of a president's term in office. And the looming threat of a post-presidency disqualification vote by the Senate could deter Trump from committing further potential abuses of power -- from his authority as commander-in-chief to his exercise of the pardon power.

Further, the disqualification power protects against the eventual return of a president who has so seriously abused his power to warrant impeachment. Typically, impeachment and conviction alone would pose a major obstacle to a politician's re-election. But Trump is anything but typical. He has shown an uncanny ability to hold onto his base of political support through countless scandals. Trump could well try to ride that support to another run for the presidency in 2024.

Think it's impractical, that he'd be too old? Consider that Trump in 2024 will be nearly the same age that President-elect Joe Biden is now. And Trump has made clear throughout his career in business and politics that he does not easily accept defeat.

Of course, it's about even more than preventing Trump from holding office again. The impending impeachment of Trump is also about the history books. It's vital that Congress condemn Trump's conduct not just in words but also in action -- and impose meaningful punishment to stand as a marker for future generations.

Impeachment and conviction without disqualification ultimately would be toothless, permitting Trump to escape with a wag of the finger but minimal concrete consequences. But disqualification sends an unmistakable message: any president who violates the oath of office as Trump has done will be cast out of office and never permitted to return.

Now your questions

Kara (Tennessee): If the President is impeached, can he lose the benefits that former presidents usually receive?

Yes, but only if impeached and convicted. The federal Former Presidents Act entitles former presidents to an array of benefits including a pension, support staff and Secret Service protection. That law also provides that its benefits are available only to a person ""whose service in such office shall have terminated other than by removal pursuant to section 4 of article II of the Constitution of the United States of America"" -- referencing the constitutional provision for impeachment, conviction and removal. Thus, on its face, the law would strip a president who has been impeached and convicted of at least some of those benefits (though it is unclear whether he would lose Secret Service protection).

There also could be an argument that if Trump is convicted by the Senate only after he has left office on January 20 -- which is possible, as discussed above -- he technically was not ""removed"" from office. But the spirit of the law plainly is to punish former presidents who have been found guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors by stripping away their post-presidency benefits.

Jim (Oregon): Could Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or others who spread falsehoods about election fraud -- and thereby contributed to inciting rioters -- be punished or even removed from office?

Yes. Article I of the Constitution allows the House and the Senate to expel their own members by votes of two-thirds of membership. Expulsion has rarely been used; no senator has been expelled since the Civil War, and only two representatives have been expelled since 1861 (in 1980 and 2002). The House and Senate also could formally censure -- essentially, reprimand -- their own members by a majority vote. While censure does not carry any specific penalty, it can have political consequences. For example, the Senate formally censured Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1954, which damaged his standing in the Senate and in the public eye.

Andreas (Illinois): Does the First Amendment apply to companies like Twitter and Facebook, or do they have the freedom to remove posts and block users as they see fit?

Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook

The latter. The First Amendment applies only to governmental action. The very first word of the amendment is ""Congress"": ""Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."" That has been applied more broadly to any governmental entity. For example, the First Amendment could apply if Congress passed a law restricting the media, or if a public school board or public library banned certain books.

But the First Amendment does not bind private actors like Twitter or Facebook. There simply is no way for Trump, or anyone else, to legally compel such private entities to allow them to use their platforms.",2021-01-12 00:00:00
Opinion: The key question for jury selectors in the George Floyd trial,"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) Jury selection is one of the most difficult -- and crucial -- steps in any criminal trial. A veteran defense lawyer once told me, ""Jury selection isn't just the most important thing; it's everything. As soon as the jury is chosen, the case is decided.""

That process of choosing a jury is especially complicated in high-profile cases that have received wide media attention. And few if any trials in recent memory have been, and will be, the focus of a brighter spotlight than the trials of the four former Minneapolis police officers who are charged with the killing of George Floyd last May.

Judge Peter Cahill recently decided that the four charged defendants will be tried in two groups. First, Derek Chauvin, who pinned his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes, will be tried alone, starting with jury selection on Monday. Then, the other three charged defendants will be tried together starting in August. This was a tactical setback for prosecutors, who objected to holding separate trials and asked the court to try all four defendants together. (Indeed, in my experience, it is advantageous for the prosecution to try all defendants at once, both for efficiency and to give the jury a full picture of the charged criminality).

The judge initially had ruled in favor of the prosecution, but then reversed course in January and ordered two separate trials because of concerns over courtroom crowding during the Covid crisis.

In both cases, the very first question will be this: how on earth do the parties select a jury in a case that virtually everybody has already heard about, and on which many already have strongly-held opinions? I've done trials that have received intense media coverage before -- though not on the scale of what we are about to see with the Chauvin trial -- and, in my experience, picking a fair jury will be difficult but not impossible.

The Minnesota rules of criminal procedure provide detailed instructions on the jury selection process. The pool of potential jurors must consist of ""persons randomly selected from a fair cross-section of qualified county residents."" Within that pool, each potential juror is then subjected to questioning -- called ""voir dire"" -- by the judge and the lawyers for the parties. The prospective jurors here have received and filled out written jury questionnaires, typically used only in higher-profile matters. The questionnaires go into depth on each potential jurors' knowledge of and views about the case, including questions about what the person has learned about the case from media reports; whether the person has a positive or negative view of any of the people involved; whether the person participated in any protests relating to Floyd's death; and the person's views on Black Lives Matter, policing, and criminal justice. The lawyers will review these questionnaires carefully to determine whether any prospective juror holds a strong predisposition for or against either party.

Following that questioning, potential jurors can be removed either ""for cause"" -- if the judge finds that the juror cannot be impartial -- or by the parties using ""peremptory"" strikes (not giving a reason) on potential jurors that they want to remove. In a second-degree murder case like the Chauvin trial, the defendant ordinarily has five peremptory strikes and the prosecutor has three; here, however, the judge has exercised his discretion to grant the defense up to 15 peremptory strikes, and the prosecution up to nine. The parties can exercise those strikes for almost any reason, but not on the basis of a potential juror's race, gender or other Constitutionally protected factor.

Every or nearly every potential juror will have heard of Floyd's death before the trial begins. But that alone does not disqualify a potential juror. The key question is whether a juror can be impartial and can decide the case solely on the basis of the evidence at trial, and not on any pre-existing opinions or outside media coverage. If so, the potential juror can serve on the jury. And, if not, the judge and parties can prevent that person from sitting on the jury. The process is not perfect -- it is impossible to truly know whether a potential juror has a pre-existing bias, or has been or will be influenced by media coverage -- but it does build in vital safeguards intended to ensure an impartial jury.

Jury impartiality is a cornerstone of our legal system. Public confidence in a trial, and the verdict, largely depends on whether the jury is capable of ruling in an unbiased manner, based solely on the evidence produced in the courtroom. And that public confidence will never be more important than in the upcoming trials of Chauvin and the other former officers in Minnesota.

Now, your questions

James (Florida): Can Steve Bannon still be charged with state crimes, even though he was pardoned by former President Trump?

Yes, he can. Bannon and three others were charged in August 2020 by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York with fraud relating to a scheme to steal money donated to a group called ""We Fund the Wall."" (Bannon pleaded not guilty and said the charges were a ""fiasco"" intended to ""stop people who want to build the wall."") On his final full day in office in January 2021, then-President Donald Trump pardoned Bannon.

A presidential pardon, however, can cover only federal charges, but not state-level charges. The Manhattan District Attorney (which can charge New York state crimes) reportedly has subpoenaed records relating to Bannon's involvement in the alleged ""We Build the Wall"" scam and there are New York state-level crimes that could apply to the conduct previously alleged by the SDNY. If the Manhattan DA's office finds sufficient evidence, it can charge Bannon, notwithstanding the pardon issued by Trump.

Gregory (Florida): Is there a way to require that presidential pardons first must be reviewed or approved by the Justice Department?

Probably not. For over 125 years, the Justice Department, through the Office of the Pardon Attorney , has provided presidents with advice and guidance relating to exercise of the pardon power. Typically, applicants submit a request for consideration to the Pardon Attorney, who then makes recommendations to the president. But the Pardon Attorney's recommendations are merely advisory, and not mandatory.

During his presidency, Trump largely ignored the Pardon Attorney. President Joe Biden is free to use the Pardon Attorney however he pleases; he can consider the Pardon Attorney's advice, follow it or ignore it altogether. While Congress theoretically could pass legislation making Pardon Attorney review and approval mandatory before a president grants any pardons, such legislation likely would violate Article II of the Constitution, which vests the pardon power solely in the president himself, unlimited by other governmental agencies or actors.

What it's like to be me,"By E. Wes Ely

Wes Ely knew that as a doctor, he couldn't kill another person just because they wanted him to. But he still had to find a way respond to Paul's request to die.",
"What happens when a patient says, 'Doc, help me die'","My 54-year-old patient was alone in the intensive care unit, with no family or friends in his life. He slumped in his bed, gasping, staring up at me. Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia, he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways, despite our best treatments.

As a newly minted doctor years ago, my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients' care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside, my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed. That is what I try to do as a physician, including, of course, what they tell me in the silences.

I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level. His face was blank. ""I want euthanasia. I'm going to die soon, so what's the point of living longer? I'm just wasted space.""

I felt nauseated. The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind. Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place.

I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport, Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father, an engineer, had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days, we'd walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn't pay anything to Mom, who didn't make much as a teacher. So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store.

While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided, I was determined to do something different with my life. Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science, and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people, science and the arts. To me, that meant medicine.

Dr. Wes Ely assessing a patient in the Medical Intensive Care Unit at Vanderbilt.

I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician, one has constantly to seek truth about the patient's diagnosis, the best treatment, and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn't change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane, this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: ""Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right."" Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote, from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person's life has value beyond measure.

I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn't kill another person just because he or she wanted me to, but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul's request to die.

'Just don't abandon me'

My response came in parts over my days with him. First, I explained that, as his physician, I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant. We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected, but I would never intentionally harm him. ""Paul, our covenant includes my limiting your suffering,"" I said. ""You are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain, anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress, but we won't deliberately end your life.""

With our eyes locked, Paul gave his instruction: ""Just don't abandon me."" And we sat there, as partners.

As a physician, there is no better place to be. Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty, we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship. He in need of help and me in need of helping.

Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms, but it wasn't enough. It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease. Physicians fail our patients on a human level. We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions, so I asked Paul about other types of therapy — art, music, spirituality, pets, sunshine — that might help him.

'He who has a ""why"" to live can bear almost any ""how""'

""I want my music. Can you get me the soundtrack for 'Lord of the Rings'?"" Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room, and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged. ""I love music. It's always been a motivator, but now ... I don't know."" He shifted in his bed. ""My goals are gone.""

Nietzsche's words came to my mind, ""He who has a 'why' to live can bear almost any 'how.'""

Viktor Frankl , as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz, used Nietzsche's quote four times in his crucial analysis, ""Man's Search for Meaning."" I think this book should be required reading for medical students.

As with many patients, Paul's story needed unpacking. ""Paul, what did you do in life?""

He smiled and shrugged. ""I'm a rare beast: a plumber who acts. I do Shakespeare festivals. You know, 'The quality of mercy is not strained.' I've been mulling over that line. Years ago I didn't understand it. I do now. Mercy should not be forced. It's better as a natural infusion, one person to another.""

I described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director, helping her cue actors. As we talked, I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover, obliging us to take breaks. Sweat would build up on his forehead, and, more than once, I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking, and it was essential.

The quality of mercy

That night I asked Christine, a nurse who loves theater, to sit and talk with Paul. Soon their lives were interwoven, too.

""I think I helped Christine,"" Paul said the next day. ""My own illness made me forget that one of my 'things' is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me, but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar. I told her my way through the worst of it."" He paused, his thoughts far away.

It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request. ""Paul, you've asked for euthanasia, and you brought up Portia's line from 'Merchant of Venice' about mercy. Can we talk about these things?"" He nodded, and closed his eyes.

""We all want to be here with you in your suffering. I want your opinion: I don't think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful, but it would, in every sense of the word, be 'strained.' It would be a forced and unnatural 'false' mercy. Whenever possible, mercy must also be lifting and healing. I don't want to abandon those key elements in serving you.""

His eyes opened wide. ""Doc, talking with you and Christine about life's best and worst times has helped."" He took a deep breath, and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils. ""Things I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she's coming back tonight, and that means the world to me."" Then, unwittingly, Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: ""When we met, I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I'm not a believer like others, but I guess I remembered the 'why' to live.""

Short of a war zone, there are few settings as raw as an ICU. Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their ""why,"" even if just for an hour or a day.

'I'm glad I didn't miss this time'

I see many paths toward survival in the ICU, and for non-survivors, myriad paths toward death: sudden, prolonged, stuttering, reluctant, stoical -- and these paths are dynamic, not static.

It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia, but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering. Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears, the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain.

Lack of control is what bothers people the most, and it drives most requests for euthanasia, which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon. As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives, looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate. As a physician, I find this is a very important ""teachable moment"" for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata, these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind, and I recalled them for Paul: ""Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin."" He nodded in agreement.

Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.

The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of 'cure,' when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.

And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician. The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer. I would be qualitatively changed. If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness. The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are.

Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won't be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried. Some will say Paul's story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same.

We are sent to heal even when cure is not possible. What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person's sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.

Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: ""I'm glad I didn't miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. ... In losing my breath, I gained it.""

Together we make a family,"This piece is the second part of a CNN Opinion series, "" What it's like to be me ,"" which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. Rebecca Cokley is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, where she works on disability policy. Formerly, she was the executive director of the National Council on Disability and served in the Obama administration in the Administration for Community Living and the Presidential Personnel Office, where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.

(CNN) I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn't ask me. He didn't even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, ""While you're down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?""

At a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: ""No!""

As upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren't seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate.

The delivery room wasn't my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn't always perfect for me growing up. My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, ""Kids like you don't go here, you go to the special school."" If it weren't for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me.

I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be ""different"" in a way that he is not.

When he comes, I'll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I've always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery.

With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist -- who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn't ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business. I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation -- which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure.

I don't know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I've asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children.

While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it's also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing.

Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act is that it's easier for people with disabilities to become parents. It's natural to assume that once people with disabilities have remedies for discrimination and greater access to society, they'll do exactly what a lot of nondisabled people do: get married and have kids. This was always a logical conclusion to me, as both my parents were little people (which is rare -- 80% of people with dwarfism are the only person in their families with it).

Growing up with a disability

My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actor Billy Barty in 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are chapters around the world , affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year.

My dad ran a Center for Independent Living for people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities.

I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor's and master's degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley with their two kids

I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith's latest film, ""Dogma,"" and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school.

It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm -- and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over.

All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the ""gay cancer,"" my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two.

I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, ""We're here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They're no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we'd hope they would be here for us.""

And I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north.

'Mom, I think I want to be a clown'

When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. ""Mom, I think I want to be clown."" She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. ""What?"" she asked.

""Yeah, I think I want to be a clown."" We rode home in silence. I didn't realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously.

I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom.

Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to Paul Steven Miller , an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be the first little person to work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read ""for fun.""

My mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010.

Taking this path was important to me -- and to my family as well.

Rebecca Cokley with her mom.

When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school. It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn't have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having ""midget midget"" shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States.

Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis.

My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos , the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job -- at Victoria's Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager.

You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, ""You have to make someone want something they don't need and want to pay too much for it.""

My boss at Victoria's Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I'd have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store.

I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They'd actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. ""Ummmmm, the girl in the black suit."" (We all wore black suits). ""Well, she's petite."" (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general.

The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were ""fascinated"" with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, ""We could pick you up and walk out with you. We'd take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us."" I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened ""spidey sense"" because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help.

Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability/Youth . I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away -- cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by ""staring at the new girl."" I have no memory of this.

Building a family

Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads.

Patrick is average height and African-American. I'm a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I'm the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he's the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work.

Rebbeca Hare and Patrick Cokley were married at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Columbia.

When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that's how those of us in the community refer to ""little people"") friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn't ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height -- they'd ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn't care either way.

I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama's White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials. To quote the boss himself, ""I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules."" And those are really the values that we stress as we're raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya.

At age 6, Jackson's awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, ""Mom, you're white, Dad's black, and I'm peach."" His dad turned around and said ""Peach? You're black."" Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said ""Peach!"" This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been.

We've purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It's important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults.

Since we're raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband's childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can't -- and in some cases, shouldn't -- be the one to answer.

As a professional advocate, I've spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police -- Eric Garner , Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland -- were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died.

Rebecca Cokley and President Obama pose for a snapshot.

Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now -- their curiosity, their feeling that they've never met a stranger, their trust in the world -- could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place.

My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn't keep it from him.

Parenthood and activism: our forms of protest in the world

When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn't be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community know this feeling all too well . Whether it's forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the ""well-meaning"" nondisabled public for centuries.

No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents.

Under the law in dozens of states, children can be removed from their homes based solely on a parent's disability. In my work as an advocate, I've spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw.

If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language. Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like ""special needs,"" ""differently abled,"" or, in a pun on language from the past, ""handi-capable.""

These aren't words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with -- they were defined by society because the concept of ""disability"" makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It's a reminder that yes, we are different.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley and their kids in their Washington neighborhood.

But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that ""disability"" is something to be ashamed of -- say, by implying that someone shouldn't have more children because of one -- society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights. We didn't celebrate the 27th anniversary of the ""Americans with Special Needs Act"" this summer, after all.

The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT -- with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and being removed by Capitol Police -- and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for.

They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live -- in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were still fighting and being framed as victims

We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It's impossible not to -- and we would be irresponsible if we didn't.

We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don't have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women's march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn't I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, ""I am the mommy,"" but not a single one apologized to me.

As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable.

Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don't know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don't care either way.

What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again.

I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family.

Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me -- and it isn't the first.

On the day that I turned 30, I journaled that I would think about becoming a mother should I still be single at 38. What that looked like, I didn't exactly know. It was a promise to myself, maybe to God.

At the time, I was in a terrible relationship with a man who told me he wanted to be with me, but he could never love me. It was because of those words that I first clung to the idea of motherhood. Maybe a man could deny me love, but he would never deny me a child.

Fast forward to my 38th birthday. I was still single, and the world of dating had changed significantly in the last eight years. Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.

Dating amounted to small talk with a stranger, who you had briefly interfaced with online because you each thought the other attractive. The small talk was a prelude to hooking up, and there were no expectations even of a text the next day.

It was brutal. And after trying my hand at it, I was no closer to finding the love of my life or starting a family.

If I needed statistics to back me up, I had them. In 2014, marriage was on the decline, as was the fertility rate in the United States.

I had one real option left -- and that was to attempt to get pregnant alone.

Maybe I didn't deserve a family, or so many of the subscribers to my conservative Christian values might say. And maybe the men with whom I had been involved didn't view me as acceptable wife/mother material.

But deep down I felt differently and decided to give myself one shot.

And so I started the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). I was mentally prepared for the physical havoc that would ensue, and I had saved every penny for it -- to the tune of $30,000.

Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.

But why didn't I adopt? After all, even if I were fortunate enough to have a child, the child would be fatherless. And many, myself included, believe this places the child in a precarious situation.

That said, at least with IVF my potential child would be biologically related to me, his or her grandparents and cousins. The child might not have a father, but he or she would have a strong bloodline. I hoped this would help ease any future struggle for my child.

The IVF experience

The very decade I was born into -- the glorious 70's -- ushered in the science and technology that might allow me to conceive. Alone.

More specifically, 1978 was the year that the first human being was born through the process of embryo creation outside of the womb, then implantation inside of the womb, pregnancy and successful birth. Since that time, IVF has produced approximately 5 million babies , with nearly 1 million of those being born in the United States.

The IVF pool is quite minuscule compared to total US births -- for example, in 2011, only 0.7% of all US births were attributed to IVF. That said, and barely optimistic, I was committed to the process, or so I thought.

And yet there I was at a bar in Los Angeles, a month out from IVF, crying in front of two people I barely knew, but knew well enough to unload to.

My life was great on paper. I had done all the right things. I went to Stanford for graduate school. I worked at the White House under Condoleezza Rice. I had the opportunity to travel the world. I had loving parents and two wonderful sisters.

And yet I felt unloved -- even unlovable. And also greatly conflicted.

On the one hand, I was ecstatic -- I was weeks away from my shot at becoming a biological mom. I started thinking about this potential path nine years ago and had been setting aside money for five years. I was in love with idea of having a family and giddy at the thought of the unknown.

But there was doubt. Goodness, there was doubt. There was that little voice inside my head -- the voice of my parents and others -- that was very much alive in me. ""Why would you purposely bring a child into the world without a father? Are you really that lonely? How would that child feel one day?""

Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it's wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.

My heart and my brain had to fight back.

No, I was not that lonely. No, I was not that selfish. Actually, it was waking up single, every single day of my life -- only to be greeted by my career -- that felt selfish. And while I could never speak for the feelings that my future child might have, I took solace in the belief that any child would be happy to be alive if he or she were sincerely loved.

Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it's wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.

As I drew nearer to the implantation date, the prospect of creating a tiny human grew more real and began to override any lingering doubt.

And so, on August 29, 2014, I asked my doctor to implant two embryos. He wisely asked me to justify two. I was quick to answer. If I were lucky enough to get pregnant with twins -- what a gift for them. They may not have a father, but they would always have each other.

I knew the statistics and did not expect to get pregnant. Given my age and the means of conception, I was praying for the long shot of one, knowing two would be a miracle.

The 2014 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report, as published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, is a humbling reminder of just how small the odds were during the year that I attempted to conceive. In 2014, a woman of my age, using fresh non-donor eggs with no previous pregnancies, had an 18.8% chance of pregnancy resulting in a live birth. When it came to percentages of cycles resulting in twin lives births, the success rate plummeted to 3.7%.

Yes, I had a 3.7% chance of success.

Choosing a donor

Of course, before the IVF process could begin, I had to choose a donor -- and let's just say I took a less than conventional approach.

Given my professional background as a conservative politico, I think people expect me to say that IQ, number of educational degrees and political association were at the top of my donor qualifications list. Not the case.

I was looking for someone who I would be attracted to if we were procreating in the traditional way.

I know this must sound incredibly superficial. But, let's be frank, it's impossible to gauge true intellect or a kind heart by virtue of an online donor search.

And so I began my search with a focus on the physical attributes that I have always been attracted to -- namely height and athleticism. Six-foot-2 and toned was my baseline.

The donor was a collegiate lacrosse athlete. I was able to see three pictures, from tot to teen, of an adorable boy with an incredible smile, unruly hair and a twinkle in his eyes. (This particular bank did not allow adult pictures of the donor for legal reasons. So, at the end of the day, the attraction part of my search was also a gamble.)

I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans -- at least on paper.

I finished my search on the scientific side of things. The donor bank I chose provided a full medical history and genetic testing results. Honestly, why wouldn't you opt for a donor with no heart disease, cancer, mental illness or any other serious genetic conditions in his family history?

This is the one distinct advantage of going the donor route as opposed to the good old-fashioned route when conceiving. While I haven't polled my married or attached friends, I am 99.9% certain that not a single one queried their partner about the specifics of their family's medical history prior to sleeping with them or accepting a marriage proposal.

I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans -- at least on paper.

The longest days of my life

In early September, my blood work came back with hormone levels signaling pregnancy. I was in shock, but I had eight long weeks to go until seeing if there was a heartbeat or two. I started to take a pregnancy test every evening. It was the longest 56 days of my life.

D-Day finally arrived. And, there on the sonogram screen right in front of me, was the most beautiful thing: my child's heartbeat, strong and steady.

I had a million immediate questions for the sonographer and started right in. She stopped me, because there was heartbeat number two. Wait, what? I was laughing and crying at the same time. This must be what joy feels like, I thought.

The cliché that I despise most is: It will happen when you least expect it. Nonsense. I had gone almost 40 years expecting nothing in terms of dating, love and, God forbid, a husband -- and I received exactly that in return.

But suddenly the least expected had happened. I was pregnant with twins.

My journal entry from the evening read as follows:

Week 8, Day 1: October 6th D Day

Dear God: Thank you.

Baby A: your heartbeat was 159 today.

Baby B: your heartbeat was 168.

I love you A & B. Please keep growing. You're looking great.

Thank you, God. I pray for their development -- from their fingers to their toes. From brain to nose. I am so grateful for these precious beings. Prepare me to be the strong parent -- fiscally and spiritually -- that they will need me to be.

Love you.

The Friday of truth

On a Friday morning roughly 30 weeks after implantation, something seemed wrong. I had such severe leg cramps that I was crawling around the apartment on my hands and knees. I called an Uber at 8:30 am. Never having taken any birthing classes, I had no idea what the onset of labor looked like.

By the time I got to the hospital the pain was so intense that I could barely make it to the door. The Uber driver offered to help me up. I was immediately checked in and within minutes was told that I was 7 cm dilated and would be headed into an emergency C-section.

My heart stopped. I was petrified that those little heartbeats were going to stop and that my sons -- my sons -- were not going to make it. I was alone in the pre-delivery room just long enough to run through every awful scenario in my head.

And then it was time. Seventy minutes after arrival, I was wheeled into a room with a team of 16 doctors and nurses waiting for me. The sight of this army, the two waiting incubators and all the other metal contraptions made me well up. I had no idea what was going to happen next, but I had never expected it to happen quite like this -- not this early, not with these many medical professionals and not entirely on my own.

Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear -- the hardest, yet best thing I've ever done.

Doctors and nurses were working quickly all around me. Epidural, check. Babies' heart rates, check. Slicing me open, check. Ripping two crimson-colored sons out of me at 10:40 am and 10:43 am, check and check.

I saw Eli and Abel for a nanosecond before the nurses cut the cords and rushed them to their incubator stations to begin inserting the breathing tubes. They were 10 weeks premature and neither could suck, swallow or breathe on their own.

The two teams whisked my babies to the Level 4 NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) without me getting to touch their skin or ask if their vital signs were stable. I did hear them cry, which was a relief. I just wish my sisters had been there to take a picture and help recount what happened. I can't ever get that moment back.

Little did I know when I moved to Denver that I would be delivering twins two years later at Denver's premier NICU hospital -- The Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian St. Luke's

I was not able to see my sons until nine very long hours after delivery. I walked into a room with two incubators housing my baby boys, who looked more like starved squirrels than the roly-poly infants that I had envisioned. All wired up, with IVs jutting out of the top of their skulls, they were absolutely perfect. Complete miracles from inception to emergency birth.

And, of course, they chose Friday the 13th of March to scare the living hell out of me and fight their way onto this Earth.

The next 60 days

Two weeks after I was released from the hospital, I found myself sleeping in my Denver home of almost two years, as my boys lived and slept inside NICU -- for 60 days straight.

And though I could easily have felt alone -- so removed from my two miracles -- I didn't.

Friends and family from across the country constantly checked in on me, calling, texting, writing me words of encouragement.

And even once Eli and Abel were out of NICU, loving and supporting friends -- and sometimes even strangers --continued to shower us with kindness and affection.

Initially, the NICU team was our rock. These complete strangers became the most significant and consequential people in the lives of my sons during their first two months. I will never be able to appropriately express my gratitude to the nurses and doctors who safeguarded their lives. Several are friends to this day.

Then my personal trainer and his wife, the first people to visit me in the hospital, became the most trusted and consistent presence in our lives. From celebrating our birthdays, to helping with our apartment move, to Fourth of July and Super Bowl celebrations, to just being those adult ears that I need -- Adam and Teri have been there for all of it.

You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.

The mother of twin boys, who lived steps away from me, became my sanity check. We were pregnant at the same time and delivered within weeks of each other. We met by fluke, thanks to a double stroller sighting in the alley.

And the parents of my first employee proved invaluable, babysitting the boys on weekends so I could nap.

I can't forget the British transplant, who regularly delivered homemade quiche on weeknights just because.

More recently, though, the manager at the Palm (steakhouse) took care of my family. It was Thanksgiving night, and I took the twins for our first holiday fête as a family of three. In one of the most random acts of kindness, the manager worked her way to our table, poured me a glass of wine, helped feed the boys, shared a bit of her life story with me and then bought our meal. She did not know me.

Most importantly, since the birth of Eli and Abel, my parents have fallen so completely in love with their grandsons that it's hard to fully put into words the intensity of their connection. What was at first an idea hard for my traditional parents to grasp, is now two, tiny human beings, who have my parents tightly wrapped around their little fingers. Though thousands of miles away, my parents -- and my sisters -- express their love and support constantly and in innumerable ways.

There are incredible people in this world. My sons' existences have made that real to me.

The lessons learned

Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear -- the hardest, yet best thing I've ever done.

My sons are my family and my future. They represent everything good, hopeful and hilarious about life. They smile and cheer when I walk into their room. They blow kisses and sneak hugs. They belly laugh when we dance. They cuddle up at night and put their heads in the crook of my neck.

They also scream, bite and bang their heads on the floor when they're upset. They chuck their food when they don't like it. They act like the world is coming to an end at bath time. And they are a constant financial stress. Being a single parent is hard as hell.

But from my two little men, I quickly internalized that love is a verb. Love is an action and something you work at every single day. You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.

They are my miracles, which I almost didn't allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.

Speaking of love, friends like to tell me that there is a man out there -- some wonderful man who will sweep me off my feet and be an excellent father. To that I say, please stop. Do I want to date? Of course. But I can honestly write that I have no expectations for love, and I certainly do not believe that there is a father out there for my sons. I am not waiting and hoping, because I have lost that hope.

Why have I lost that hope? Truth be told, I have been vulnerable with a few men pre- and post-pregnancy. But rejection upon rejection by man after man will do it to you. Even when you are that aloof gal, who doesn't ask questions or have expectations of something real or long-term, it still ends. I guess you just lose your luster after awhile. It's my reality, and it never changes.

And while we are on the topic of relationships, I would note that I will forever be perplexed by the rate of unsolicited and unexpected congratulatory communications from ex-boyfriends after years of no contact. These were the men who rejected me. These were the men who left after months or years of pretending and/or cheating.

After the birth of my sons, these same men suddenly thought they had a green card to strike up conversation and ask for pictures of the twins. One suggested grabbing dinner in DC. One kindly offered to come to Colorado to help run errands, cook dinner or do whatever I needed.

The attention was hard to digest. I once cried over these men. Perhaps this was a way of absolving their guilt for being dishonest or wasting my time? Perhaps they were sincerely happy for me, which would suggest that they did respect me after all? Perhaps they were feeling slighted or envious that I went it alone, without them? I'll never know.

And, most importantly, I finally no longer care.

Though I may never have a significant other, I do have my sons, who've taken me from unloved to loved and from unlovable to lovable. They've done this all on their own. They are my miracles, which I almost didn't allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.

Prior to Eli and Abel, I wasted at least half of my adult life obsessing about things I had lost -- men who broke my heart, clients who weren't a good fit, friendships that had faded.

My sons taught me to focus on the miracles that are right in front of my eyes every single day, beginning with my 3.7%.

Yazmil with her daughter at 9 months

""The article I just read in CNN on a single mom by choice hit home. My daughter just turned 1 and I too began this journey a little less than two years ago. I will be 38 in May and I always wanted a family. I dated someone long-term and when that relationship ended, by the time I finished licking my wounds, I was 36 with no prospects. I went on every online dating site and never met anyone worth my time. I decided to give insemination a try. I conceived relatively quickly. It was the best decision for me. I know another friend who went this route and after sharing my story many more friends are interested in becoming single moms by choice. It's not that I don't want a partner, I just didn't want my opportunity to become a mother to pass me by in the meantime.

""(The article) made me happy to know that more women are not afraid to say how they conceived their babies outside of ""traditional relationships."" That we are taking control of our lives, our fertility and bringing babies into this world that are wanted and loved before they are even conceived.""

""Blessed and fortunate to have my own modern family thanks to surrogacy.

""Our dream of having a baby started in 2014, the year we got married. We found a surrogacy agency in an IVF practice in Connecticut. We were matched with our first surrogate in 2015 and she got pregnant right away, but sadly she had a miscarriage at eight-and-a-half weeks. We were devastated and upset, naturally, but we knew we didn't want to give up because we really wanted to have a baby. So we waited and we tried again and were matched with another surrogate in 2016 and she also got pregnant right away, but this time she carried the baby to 38-and-a-half weeks and we had Chelsea.

""We feel really lucky and fortunate to have Chelsea because we know how difficult it can be to have a baby in untraditional ways. Even if you have all the means and resources necessary that doesn't always guarantee a baby. ""

So I wrote my own story for him. The article inspired me to share it.

""He never asked any questions and understands some of his friends have dads and some don't. I wanted to answer his question of why he doesn't, regardless of whether the question is posed. And to let him know the subject was not taboo.""

Elisabeth Szentkereszty de Zagon: Brussels, Belgium

Elisabeth and her daughter Lynne enjoy a duck tour on a visit to Boston.

""I am a US-Belgian dual citizen, single mom, living in Brussels After many failed attempts (albeit fun) at a real relationship, I decided to have a child on my own. Having a supportive family, especially my sister living in Belgium, was one of the reasons I did not hesitate to go solo.

""When the adoption agency called me saying that they had received the picture of my daughter, I ran to go see her photo.

""After an exhausting trip, arrived late into the night in Changsha, capital of the Hunan province, we went to the office of child affairs, or something of the sort, and each waited until we were called and they brought the babies out one by one. I looked at her as they were putting her in my arms, the most amazing and unreal feeling possible. She cried right away and I put a pacifier in her mouth and it calmed her right away.

""What I remember most, is putting her on a chair in the hotel room and just staring at this little bundle of baby and saying, I cannot believe she is mine! The wait had not been too long (seven months for China to pair me up with Lynne and from the start of the process of first meeting with the agency to the file being sent was about 12 months, so all in all, about one-and-a-half years -- so not too long).""

""Although she's a typical teenager, we have a lot of good times,"" Elisabeth says of her daughter Lynne.

""She got attached to me immediately and when we were in the dining hall, I could not even leave her in her buggy to get food, she had to come with me and see me. The nannies had told me that she was always crawling behind one or the other person at the orphanage so she had to be in someone's company at all times.

""She still does not like being alone! She loves being close to me and needs company to be happy, even if now, as a teen, she can spend hours in her room doing who knows what! I call her my little pot of glue.

""Adopting is not easy. I mean being a single mom, making all the decisions, is hard. And having a smart child, ahead of her years for some things, is challenging to say the least. Also, an abandoned child's brain develops differently and this is why sometimes, they rebel against us and make life very hard. They try, albeit unconsciously, to do all they can to push us away. They are repeating the abandonment they felt as a child. But you have to hold fast, hold on and show you are always there. But it's tough when they bite and scratch and break things, kick you etc ... But with the help of family, psychologists and relational therapy, you get it done. And now, although she's a typical teenager, we have a lot of good times.

""What she wants the most is spending time with me, so when we can, we travel. We've been to Burkina Faso, Mexico, China (went back to do some volunteer teaching for 3 months in 2009 near Qingdao), all over Europe, California, New York, Atlanta, South Carolina, Boston, Cuba ... She has a map on her wall with pins of all the places she's been. We'd like to go to Japan next!

""All in all, being a mom is the toughest job. It is also the most rewarding. I do not know how they decide which parent gets which child in China, but I would not have wanted any other. It had to be her, no one else. I love her with all my heart. And I do get the love back. Those few moments when she shows her love with no boundaries are worth all the pain I go through to be her mom. I'd do it all the same if I had to. Would not change a thing!""

""I am a single parent by choice. I decided at 25 that I wanted to adopt. It was something that was important to me, so I did. Not all of my family and friends were on board, but I knew it's what I was meant to do. The process was faster and smoother than I could have ever imagined. My son was in my arms just four months after my home study was completed. We maintain a relationship with his birth family, which I am very thankful for. Although it hasn't been easy, it has been worth it. He brings so much joy to myself and my family. He's such a wonderful, loving little boy. Even those that weren't on board with my choice to pursue adoption at such a young age are just simply amazed at how incredibly perfect he is for our family. We love him with every ounce of our being.

""The one aspect of the adoption that I feel I wasn't prepared for was the current environment that I am raising a black son in. I have always tried to be a strong advocate for the AA community and to stay educated, but never really understood what it meant to be black in America until I saw the world through my son's eyes. Although I still don't fully understand, as I myself am shielded with my own privilege, my eyes have been opened. Sometimes painfully so. I worry about him every day. But, he is my world and I would do it again in a heart beat.""",2017-04-28 00:00:00
Opinion: Who's teaching us to hate,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) Where does the hate come from? That was the question on many people's minds after the killing of women at three spas in Georgia on Tuesday drew even more attention to the targeting of Asian Americans in the year since the coronavirus pandemic was declared.

A 21-year-old man was arrested and charged with shooting to death eight people, including six Asian women, in metropolitan Atlanta. While officials said they were investigating the motive -- they cited the suspect's claim he had a ""sex addiction"" -- there was growing outrage over the spate of attacks ever since the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in China, and politicians, including then-President Donald Trump, labeled it the ""China virus.""

""Politicians didn't invent prejudice, but they are exploiting it for political gain, and destroying lives in the process, "" wrote. ""During House hearings on anti-Asian violence Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, somehow managed to speak approvingly of lynchings -- 'Find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree...we take justice very seriously...' -- while excoriating China's regime and its role in the pandemic. It was a virtuoso performance of false equivalency and incitement. But stoking racism and fear of immigrants has become one of the go-to tools of the Trumpist Republican Party.""

, the daughter of a refugee father from China and an immigrant mother from Jamaica, lived in the South for nearly 20 years. She wrote that "" To be an Asian woman in America means you can't just be what you are : a fully enfranchised human being. It means you are a blank screen on which others project their stories, especially, too often, their sexualized fantasies -- because US culture has long presented Asian women as sexualized objects for White male enjoyment."" A professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Ho is the president of the Association for Asian American Studies.

""To be an Asian woman working in the US South in the massage industry means being an object, not a subject...It means further disappearing: being one of six women killed in what people aren't even calling a racially motivated crime, although can there be any doubt that it was misogyny and toxic masculinity that killed you?""

Kristie Lu Stout wrote from Hong Kong that ""hate has turned my once proud and confident Asian-American mother into a shut-in. It's not because of the virus as Covid-19 continues to rage in my home state of California. It's because she is absolutely certain that as an older Asian woman with a limp she will be targeted by violence.

War of words

It didn't take long. President Joe Biden isn't even finished with his first 100 days in office and he's already locked in a war of words with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Daniel Treisman wrote, ""It was an interesting choice of phrase for a leader accused of having his enemies poisoned... On Wednesday, Biden told interviewer George Stephanopoulos that he would indeed characterize Putin as a ""killer"" and said he would ""pay a price"" after a US government intelligence report accusing Russia of meddling in the 2020 election to help Donald Trump. Putin answered Biden, ""I wish you health."" As Russia expertwrote, ""It was an interesting choice of phrase for a leader accused of having his enemies poisoned... All this suggests the depths to which US-Russia relations have sunk .""

Lisa Curtis, who was deputy assistant to Trump and a director on the National Security Council, called the Biden move ""a remarkable demonstration that it will not only build on the momentum the alliance has gained over the last three years, Biden's policy on Russia couldn't be more different from Trump's. But on China, the two administrations may have a lot in common. At the end of last week, Biden's team brought together the leaders of the ""Quad"" countries -- Australia, India, Japan and the US., who was deputy assistant to Trump and a director on the National Security Council, called the Biden move ""a remarkable demonstration that it will not only build on the momentum the alliance has gained over the last three years, but also make it the centerpiece of the US' Indo-Pacific strategy ,"" to counter ""the rising superpower,"" China.

Since then, they've rescheduled the wedding three times, waiting for a time when a large gathering would be safe again. They are not alone of course -- millions have canceled plans and taken smart precautions against spreading the virus. But now there are glimmers of hope.

CNN's global tracker shows that an average of 11 million vaccine doses are being administered each day around the world. The US is among the nations furthest along in vaccinating its population, with 12% fully -- and another 10% partly -- vaccinated.

Kent Sepkowitz. ""Like everything else in the real world, pandemic control will require that people make good decisions."" Still, there are fears about variant versions of the virus that causes Covid-19, and Europe is struggling with a resurgence, along with a slow rollout of vaccines. ""The virus will always find a way around things — become more transmissible, less vaccine-controllable ,"" wrote Dr..

As hard as it may be to get a vaccine appointment right now, the surprising reality is that the US will soon have an enormous glut of vaccines, wrote Michael Camuñez, a former US Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. It has secured enough doses of the three FDA -approved vaccines for at least 500 million people, ""twice the target population.""

""We can't let a life-saving surplus go to waste,"" Camuñez wrote. The first place that should get America's excess vaccine? Mexico. It is one of the nation's largest trading partners and shares a 2,200 mile border with the US. ""The longer Mexico persists with a majority of its population unvaccinated, the greater the risk that a new mutation or strain of the virus could emerge and infect those in the US,"" he observed in a CNN Opinion piece published Monday. On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is finalizing plans to start sharing doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Mexico and Canada.

Nevertheless, there is a great deal more work that needs to be done to rebuild trust in the vaccine.

Fundamental rights

How did President Joe Biden win approval for a $1.9 trillion Covid-relief package that sent money to most Americans, state and local governments, schools and businesses? Credit a 47-year Georgia politician who continually demonstrates her accomplishment. Stacey Abrams became the first woman party leader in the Georgia legislature, narrowly lost a race for governor and led voter-outreach efforts that helped turn the red state blue in November and then went on to elect two Democratic senators.

Now Abrams is focused on fighting GOP efforts to make voting harder in states where Democrats scored victories last year. ""Many Republicans have weaponized the 2020 election lies as the impetus to propose sweeping efforts to suppress voter access ,"" Abrams wrote for CNN Opinion. ""The litany of proposed changes is dizzying -- from making voting by mail more difficult by eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, to limiting early voting options to restricting ballot drop box locations.""

She urged the Senate to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, even if it has to make an exception to the filibuster rule, as it did with the Covid relief package. ""Nothing is more essential to the durability of our democracy than the ability of the people to speak, regardless of ZIP code, race, age or income.""

Charlie Dent, a Republican, warned Democrats to take care. ""If the filibuster is eliminated -- and when Republicans regain control of the White House and Congress someday -- Former Rep., a Republican, warned Democrats to take care. ""If the filibuster is eliminated -- and when Republicans regain control of the White House and Congress someday -- Democrats should expect attempts by the GOP to strike back ."" The filibuster needs changes, Dent argued. ""Without a bipartisan consensus on changes to the filibuster, however, Congress will become even more tragically divided than it already is.""

The Democratic-controlled House is facing a potentially momentous election ruling. Rita Hart, a Democratic candidate in Iowa, lost her election by six votes to Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, according to that state's election officials. There are 22 disputed ballots, enough to oust the Republican and install Hart in the seat, if the Democratic-controlled House supports her challenge.

Joshua A. Douglas argued that it would be a mistake: ""Former President Donald Trump infamously refused to accept defeat in 2020, producing dangerous results for the peaceful transfer of power. He wanted Vice President Pence and Republicans in Congress to object to states that he lost. That mindset — that it is acceptable for a losing candidate to appeal to a favorable partisan body to challenge the results — Election law expertargued that it would be a mistake: ""Former President Donald Trump infamously refused to accept defeat in 2020, producing dangerous results for the peaceful transfer of power.

New York (and California) states of mind

The governors of two huge coastal states faced crises -- of two very different natures -- this week that could end with them thrown them out of office. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is under investigation by the State Attorney General and a state assembly committee that could launch an effort to impeach him over sexual harassment allegations and a scandal involving the misreporting of deaths in nursing homes during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Kara Alaimo. ""It is not news that Gov. Cuomo is a bully. While there is no excuse for his behavior, New Yorkers also bear some responsibility for repeatedly choosing to elevate him to power. Now, it's time for all of us It shouldn't have taken the recent revelations for New Yorkers to recognize that Cuomo's conduct has long been disqualifying, wrote. ""It is not news that Gov. Cuomo is a bully. While there is no excuse for his behavior, New Yorkers also bear some responsibility for repeatedly choosing to elevate him to power. Now, it's time for all of us to reevaluate the values we want our leaders to embody and withdraw support for the kinds of men who -- intentionally or unintentionally -- hold women back .""

Lincoln Mitchell, but his rivals in the state may fear that the potential elevation of lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat from upstate, could frustrate their hopes -- of either a progressive successor to Cuomo, or, in the Republicans' case, of a GOP governor. The case ""for impeaching New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is increasingly compelling,"" wrote, but his rivals in the state may fear that the potential elevation of lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat from upstate, could frustrate their hopes -- of either a progressive successor to Cuomo, or, in the Republicans' case, of a GOP governor.

Instead, much of the public disaffection is In California, Republicans may have secured enough petition signatures to force Gov. Gavin Newsom into a recall election. But it's not a partisan ""power play,"" wrote. ""Voters don't want to recall Newsom because of his stances on climate change, race relations or cultural wedge issues. Instead, much of the public disaffection is rooted in Newsom's mismanagement and inadequate leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic ,"" including a failure to reopen many schools, reversals on reopening businesses, questions about vaccine distribution and trouble with the unemployment insurance program, according to Chen.

Nestled in the hundreds of pages of the Covid relief bill are provisions worth $5 billion that begin to reverse the historic wrongs suffered by African American farmers, wrote Peniel E. Joseph. ""Black folk have farmed, planted, tilled and cultivated agricultural and food production in America since their arrival from Africa on slave ships,"" Joseph observed.

A century ago, black farmers owned 14% of all farms. Today they own ""less than 1% of American farmland. These disparities reflect oppressive practices after slavery that blocked Black wealth accumulation. Former enslaved African Americans, after being promised '40 acres and a mule' as compensation for decades of unpaid labor during racial slavery, were instead coerced through violence and economic intimidation into peonage and sharecropping that kept Black farmers living in perpetual debt."" The new law will relieve farmers of $4 billion in debt and invest another $1 billion in ""outreach, education, grants and investments.""

Keri Leigh Merritt. ""According to Mississippi Today, over 40,000 people, the equivalent of a sold-out game at Wrigley Field, As one injustice faced some resolution in parts of the South, another plagued it. ""Many of the primarily Black residents of Mississippi's capital, Jackson, spent weeks without running water after a cold spell burst a huge number of the city's pipes,"" wrote historian. ""According to Mississippi Today, over 40,000 people, the equivalent of a sold-out game at Wrigley Field, were not able to drink, bathe or wash clothes, dishes, hands or even flush toilets -- all during a pandemic... As Mississippi Free Press reported, Governor Tate Reeves and other White lawmakers are essentially holding the Black-led, Black-populated city hostage, refusing to fund repairs."" Officials announced Wednesday that the boil water advisories were finally lifted.

For Merritt, the situation brought to mind Nina Simone's haunting song, written in 1963, ""Mississippi Goddam.""

F. Scott Fitzgerald responded with 10 pages of handwritten comments.

Among them: ""slow and needs cutting...rather gassy...definitely dull...offensive...too glib."" But in his notes, which are now among Hemingway's papers at the JFK Presidential Library, he also called it a ""beautiful book"" and urged Hemingway to end what would eventually be titled, ""A Farewell to Arms,"" with a ""wonderful"" passage that included these lines:

""The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially."" Hemingway rejected that suggestion and wrote at the bottom of Fitzgerald's letter, ""kiss my ass."" The ""broken places"" passage wound up tucked away in Chapter 34

But President Joe Biden invoked it Thursday evening to sum up the year-long pandemic: ""Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do...We have seen front-line and essential workers risking their lives, sometimes losing them, to save and help others, researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine, and so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places.""

The President held out hope that every adult American could be eligible for a vaccine by May 1 -- and that people could safely gather in small groups for traditional July 4 family barbecues. ""When Biden speaks about the pandemic, when he implores Americans to do their part, when he speaks about losses, and about his determination to defeat the virus,"" wrote Frida Ghitis, ""there's a striking earnestness in his demeanor. He promises to tell the truth. We've all learned to become cynical, skeptical of politicians, but Biden sounds, as he might say, like the real deal.""

Julian Zelizer wrote, Biden's ""ability to speak to Americans in a direct and familiar manner, along with his knack for showing genuine empathy for the challenges they face as individuals and families, Likening Biden's speech to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats and President Ronald Reagan's speech after the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, historianwrote, Biden's ""ability to speak to Americans in a direct and familiar manner, along with his knack for showing genuine empathy for the challenges they face as individuals and families, will help guide the country toward the next stage of recovery .""

Jill Filipovic noted. ""It sends $1,400 stimulus checks to close to 90% of American households, directs billions to small businesses and schools, pours necessary resources into vaccine distribution, extends unemployment benefits and offers parents an unprecedented child allowance -- a cash benefit for families with children.

No, it's not everything progressives wanted. But it's the most ambitious cash assistance plan I've seen in my lifetime .""

Scott Hadland, an addiction expert based in Boston, observed that the ""pandemic has pushed already economically vulnerable Americans into even greater despair"" and that ""overdose deaths are now surging to record highs."" Addiction ""preys"" on ""lost jobs, worsened poverty, housing and food insecurity and lapses in education.""

Addiction ""preys"" on ""lost jobs, worsened poverty, housing and food insecurity and lapses in education."" To oppose the relief package ""is to overlook the possibility of hundreds of thousands more lives being lost to addiction for years to come.""

Republicans and relief

The bill put members of the opposition party in Congress in an odd position: Covid relief is widely popular. Most Americans are going to welcome the arrival of thousands of dollars in their bank accounts, and businesses, schools and local and state governments will benefit. But not a single Republican legislator voted for it. As CNN's Manu Raju noted, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi even tweeted in support of $28.6 billion in aid to restaurants -- despite having voted against the bill.

Scott Jennings, a CNN commentator and Republican strategist, argued that ""the merits of this bill are more than debatable, as less than 10% of the $1.9 trillion plan is spent on direct Covid spending and just 1% is for vaccine distribution"" and that it is ""hard to see"" how provisions in the bill are , a CNN commentator and Republican strategist, argued that ""the merits of this bill are more than debatable, as less than 10% of the $1.9 trillion plan is spent on direct Covid spending and just 1% is for vaccine distribution"" and that it is ""hard to see"" how provisions in the bill are ""worth further mortgaging our children and grandchildren's future with all this new debt.""

Ron Brownstein wrote that ""although every House and Senate Republican voted against the rescue plan, it has not generated anything like the uprisings against new government spending and programs that engulfed Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during each man's first year in office. Indeed, throughout the legislative fight, congressional Republicans and conservative media outlets like Fox News wrote that ""although every House and Senate Republican voted against the rescue plan, it has not generated anything like the uprisings against new government spending and programs that engulfed Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during each man's first year in office. Indeed, throughout the legislative fight, congressional Republicans and conservative media outlets like Fox News appeared more interested in focusing attention on peripheral cultural issues , like whether Dr. Seuss had become a victim of liberal 'cancel culture.'""

Pandemic anniversary

For many, this week's anniversary of the declaration of the pandemic was an emotional moment, a time to look back at all that has been lost and to look ahead at our aspirations for a return to normal life.

Julie Gallagher was Zooming with friends she hadn't seen in person for more than a year when one said, ""'I'm just scared to feel hopeful.'"" And when someone revealed that she had just gotten her first vaccine dose, the "" was Zooming with friends she hadn't seen in person for more than a year when one said, ""'I'm just scared to feel hopeful.'""

We buzzed about who else in our lives has been vaccinated, who has had trouble booking an appointment, who was eligible in our home states. We went through our bucket list of what we will do first once the majority of Americans have been vaccinated and our worlds return to 'normal.'""

When Tess Taylor found out she was eligible for a shot, she took her 9-year-old son, ""put on our favorite music in the car, got celebratory frozen yogurt and headed out"" to the Oakland coliseum where FEMA workers directed them through a maze of traffic cones to a tent where ""Keith, the masked man with kind eyes, was jabbing my shoulder, and I didn't have to look. He said something nice to my son -- 'I bet you're quite a slugger!' -- and poof, we were pulling ahead to the place where we could honk our horn in case anything goes wrong, except no one was honking....""

""The 15 minutes we are supposed to wait flew by, and then we were back out again, entering the freeway, and suddenly everything seemed so much more beautiful , even the trash in the gully, and the graffitied sides of the boxcars, rising against the green grass of spring. We rose up on the 880. Against a peach-colored sky, San Francisco and the bridge looked like an elaborate layered cut-out in a children's book, and the distant city seemed like the most beautiful place, and I realized that it is a beloved place, a not-so-distant place, a part of the world that one day, not so far from now, many people will be able to collectively re-enter.""

It is baffling that anyone is surprised about the questions raised over the skin color of the couple's baby, given how central Whiteness is to the image of the monarchy.

"Opinion: Harry, Meghan and the power of their story","Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) Among journalists in Queen Victoria's England, Walter Bagehot was a central figure. Not only did he marry well -- to the daughter of the Economist's founder, whose death installed Bagehot in the editor's chair -- he also wrote a classic study of British government, ""The English Constitution.""

Of the monarchy's role, Bagehot famously cautioned, ""Above all things our royalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to poke about it you cannot reverence it. When there is a select committee on the Queen, the charm of royalty will be gone. Its mystery is its life. We must not let in daylight upon magic.""

Whatever magic is left in the House of Windsor today, after ""The Crown,"" may not survive Sunday night's airing of Oprah Winfrey's interview with Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.

Meghan told Winfrey that the royal family, aka ""The Firm,"" was ""perpetuating falsehoods"" against her. Her words evoked memories of the tension between Buckingham Palace and Princess Diana in the 1990s.

The palace announced Wednesday that it was investigating accusations that the duchess had bullied employees in the royal household and that it was ""very concerned."" After the investigation was reported,noted, ""Meghan's spokesman said the duchess was 'saddened by this latest attack on her character,' and a spokesperson for the Sussexes dismissed the Times report as 'a calculated smear campaign.'"" Thomas added that the palace's ""eagerness"" to respond to the allegations stands ""in stark contrast to its previous reactions to the substantially more serious complaints against the Queen's third child, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. These have been minimal, and resolutely supportive of the prince ...""

Peggy Drexler wrote, ""It's easy to feel bad for Harry, who grew up in the spotlight, and for Meghan, who many would say both pursued that attention and fought it."" For all his privileges, ""since he was small, Harry's life was one of being followed, trailed. He was young when his mother, Princess Diana, was pursued to her death by paparazzi, but old enough to remember.""

Harry is sixth in line to the British throne and thus unlikely to ever have a constitutional role in the United Kingdom's government. But the fascination with his family's story lands him and his wife in the headlines constantly, even at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic and economic turmoil are the pressing everyday realities for billions of people.

'Smorgasbord of stupid'

As if to satisfy the need for distractions, conservative media seized on an innocuous announcement from Dr. Seuss Enterprises Tuesday that it was ending distribution of six of Seuss' many books because they contained racist images.

Jill Filipovic: ""It is a recognition that a small portion of his older work is out of place today. The storyline: 'Cancel culture' is targeting Dr. Seuss! The truth, according to: ""It is a recognition that a small portion of his older work is out of place today. No one is canceling Dr. Seuss ."" But this decision ""has prompted a full-on right-wing freakout. The story got top billing on Fox News and has been burning up right-wing Twitter,"" she wrote.

""In case you've been too busy paying attention to other things -- say, surviving a global pandemic,"" observed SE Cupp, you might have missed the outrage around ""an Ice Age species of human that went extinct 40,000 years ago, a wildly popular series of children's books spanning the mid-20th century, and a starchy tuber-turned dress-up toy from the 50s."" She wrote that ""right-wing culture warriors"" not only fumed over the Seuss story but assailed the announcement of a gender-neutral ""Potato Head toy."" They were also up in arms when President Joe Biden referred to state leaders who dropped mask mandates as exhibiting ""Neanderthal thinking.""

""I didn't know Neanderthals had a lobby, but they do and her name is Marsha Blackburn. The Tennessee Senator went on Fox Business to defend the poor, oppressed, EXTINCT class, insisting, in the present tense, 'Neanderthals are hunter-gatherers, they're protectors of their family. They are resilient. They are resourceful.'""

Covid relief

On Friday, as the Senate moved toward passage of Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill, the Labor Department reported that the United States added 379,000 jobs in February -- reflecting a faster pace of hiring but with a workforce still nearly 10 million smaller than a year earlier.

Julian Zelizer. ""It's likely that his experience as vice president taught him that The relief bill proceeded through Congress without any Republican support, in contrast to bipartisan votes for stimulus during the Trump administration. Even moderate GOP senators showed little appetite for the kind of major stimulus bill Biden wanted -- and he took note, wrote. ""It's likely that his experience as vice president taught him that there is in fact a red and blue America , and that trying to blend them could easily lead to political paralysis...Biden is making his own decisions, shaping his own agenda and counting on his own party to move policies forward rather than waiting for Republicans to help him along.""

Dean Obeidallah. ""GOP House representatives apparently believe that their base would Polls show that 68% of Americans back the Covid-19 bill, so why would the GOP vote no? ""The Republican Party's own cold calculations have concluded that opposing this measure is good for them politically,"" observed. ""GOP House representatives apparently believe that their base would rather have the 'red meat' of fighting Democrats than the actual red meat that this relief bill could provide them the funds to afford .""

Lanhee J. Chen, but it might prove to be a ""Pyrrhic victory -- one that they may come to regret in the weeks and months ahead."" Such a ""go-it-alone approach Biden is likely to hail the bill's passage as a major accomplishment, wrote, but it might prove to be a ""Pyrrhic victory -- one that they may come to regret in the weeks and months ahead."" Such a ""go-it-alone approach will only make it more politically challenging for Republicans to step out and work with Democrats in the future on issues such as prescription drug pricing, tougher action against China or infrastructure legislation."" And, Chen suggested, the unilateral passage of the bill is uniting Republicans at a point when the party seemed in danger of fracture over the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.

A year of lockdown

It was 65 years ago that a vaccine began to put an end to a virus epidemic that gave American parents nightmares. As David Oshinsky wrote in his Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Polio: An American Story,"" the newly developed Salk vaccine was soon administered to a majority of Americans under 40. ""Swimming pools reopened in the summer of 1956,"" Oshinsky noted. ""A child with a fever or a stiff neck no longer sent shockwaves through the neighborhood. Newspapers stopped printing the daily box score of polio victims on the front page.""

This coming week marks the one-year anniversary of the lockdown that changed the lives of Americans, and naturally people are yearning for a return to normal life, just like when the polio threat ebbed. The pace of vaccinations against Covid-19 is quickening. Infections and deaths are dropping. But experts say it's too soon to let up on protective measures, such as masks and social distancing.

Texas-based executive Katie Mehnert was getting her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Bayou City Event Center in Houston when the news broke that Governor Greg Abbott was ""lifting Texas' mask mandate -- even as health officials warn not to ease restrictions aimed at stemming the pandemic. No one at the vaccination site removed their mask, fortunately. But we immediately started discussing the decision -- and we were all appalled.""

""Abbott's announcement may have been cheered by some in the business community, but make no mistake: Those of us who want to see a thriving economic climate are far from universally on his side. Instead, we recognize that to save lives and build a strong long-term future we have to put science first. And the science does not back up his decision ,"" Mehnert pointed out.

Lisa Respers France's parents were due to celebrate their 50th anniversary this year. ""Mom and I had frantically searched for appointments for her and dad,"" wrote France, a senior writer for CNN's entertainment team. ""They fell ill right after her doctor's office had scheduled her to receive her first dose and we were continuing our search for dad. 'We were so close to getting them vaccinated,' I sobbed after the hospital called to inform me my father didn't make it.""

Gary D. Respers Sr died on February 18, ""leaving a hole in our family that can never be filled,"" Lisa wrote. ""I pray for all the families like ours who are left to wonder what could have been if the coronavirus had been handled differently from the onset . I also pray for those of you who are survivors -- either of the virus or the fear that comes with watching someone you love battle it and come out alive.""

Trump at CPAC

Donald Trump was so clearly the star of the Conservative Political Action Conference that it included a golden idol sculpted in his honor (made in China). Michael D'Antonio was among those who pointed out how odd it was for Republicans to venerate the defeated President. ""He lost the White House (big time), and (on his watch) his party lost the Senate and the House in the midterms. He lost Twitter and Facebook. Revenues are down across his business empire. What's a losing businessman-turned-politician to do?""

""If he's former president Donald Trump, the answer is: use his principal assets -- fame and attitude -- to revive his brand through a 'hostile takeover'...With the help of his son, Donald Jr., he claimed both the conference and the GOP as his own.""

Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board. ""If CPAC represented America, Mr. Trump would still reside in the White House, not Mar-a-Lago. He lost to Joe Biden, the old Democratic war horse, by seven million votes. He also lost five states he carried in 2016, even Georgia... The cult of Trump proved confounding to the. ""If CPAC represented America, Mr. Trump would still reside in the White House, not Mar-a-Lago. He lost to Joe Biden, the old Democratic war horse, by seven million votes. He also lost five states he carried in 2016, even Georgia... if 2020 was so fabulous, why are Republicans shut out of power up and down Pennsylvania Avenue? They have zero influence over the $1.9 trillion spending extravaganza they rightly deplore. Democrats are slowly erasing the Trump legacy on taxes, deregulation, energy, education, and so much more.""

Scott Jennings, but ""there's no evidence the GOP can win the 2024 presidential campaign Republicans have good reason to think they could make gains in Congress in the 2022 midterms, wrote, but ""there's no evidence the GOP can win the 2024 presidential campaign unless it embraces a more elastic brand , which welcomes country clubbers, white and blue collar workers, young and old, White and non-White...But who can lead the party to that broad coalition?"" Likely not Trump, who ""got a smaller percentage of the vote than Mitt Romney. And that was before the failed insurrection wherein Trump violated his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.""

Nicole Hemmer, ""conservatives in media and Congress have sought to rewrite the events of the day. As new reports from the New York Times and Washington Post show, much of the right has embraced the conspiracy theory that the insurrection was a false-flag event, an effort by undercover anti-fascists to smear and discredit the Trump administration and the movement that supports it. While that is not remotely true, it has quickly become an article of faith, evidence that the InfoWars-ification of the right is nearly complete."" As Hemmer noted, Republicans backing conspiracy theories risk In the two months since the Jan. 6 riot, wrote, ""conservatives in media and Congress have sought to rewrite the events of the day.

While that is not remotely true, it has quickly become an article of faith, evidence that the InfoWars-ification of the right is nearly complete."" As Hemmer noted, Republicans backing conspiracy theories risk ""transforming the Party of Lincoln into the Party of Alex Jones.""

George Floyd trial

Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, charged in the death of George Floyd, an event that convulsed America and the world last May. Outside the courtroom, the focus of the case will be around issues of ""disproportionate treatment of Black Americans by the police,"" wrote Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor and Minnesota-based law professor. But inside the courtroom, he wrote, race will be the missing element.

Racial bias isn't a component of the murder and manslaughter charges facing Chauvin. "" This jarring contrast risks further damaging our racial divisions , as the evidence and arguments will seem to be ignoring what is most important,"" Osler wrote. ""An acquittal would be devastating to race relations, and a conviction would do little to heal longstanding harms.""

Elie Honig, asked, "" Another former federal prosecutor, CNN legal analyst, asked, "" How on earth do the parties select a jury in a case that virtually everybody has already heard about, and on which many already have strongly-held opinions? I've done trials that have received intense media coverage before -- though not on the scale of what we are about to see with the Chauvin trial -- and, in my experience, picking a fair jury will be difficult but not impossible.""

International Women's Day

Alyssa Milano, who is backing the ""Marshall Plan for Moms,"" wrote that ""we are doing the critical and extremely difficult unpaid labor of motherhood. And for so many women during the pandemic, International Women's Day arrives Monday in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis., who is backing the ""Marshall Plan for Moms,"" wrote that ""we are doing the critical and extremely difficult unpaid labor of motherhood.

Last September alone, four times as many women left the labor force as men, and twice as many women as men did so for childcare purposes. At home, we suddenly became teachers and full-time caregivers. We're figuring out how to keep our kids engaged in their education and participating in schooling -- often without any support.""

Melanne Verveer and Jessica Smith of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace & Security gave the Biden administration high marks for its creation of a White House Gender Policy Council but argued that more needs to be done: ""A top priority must be to andof the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace & Security gave the Biden administration high marks for its creation of a White House Gender Policy Council but argued that more needs to be done: ""A top priority must be to apply a gender lens to one of the Biden administration's key issues: climate change ...the administration should account for how gender and other factors like ethnicity, race and socio-economic status, leave some more seriously affected by climate change than others.""

Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand and Laura Chinchilla, former president of Costa Rica, wrote that ""to advance gender equity, On a worldwide scale,, former prime minister of New Zealand and, former president of Costa Rica, wrote that ""to advance gender equity, we most prioritize the most basic rights that are still denied to women and children . Let's start with the most fundamental of human needs -- access to clean water and safe sanitation, including soap for handwashing. Too many of us take these for granted, and yet according to the WHO, 2.2 billion people don't have access to safe drinking water and according to UN Water, 4.2 billion don't have a safe place to use the toilet.""

An essential worker

The year of lockdown has been an eventful one for Onesimo Garcia, superintendent of an apartment building in Brooklyn. As Abigail Pesta wrote, ""The stretch of Grand Avenue where Onesimo Garcia works in Brooklyn is not exactly grand. It's a desolate warehouse street, in the shadow of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, where cars roar overhead...It's a street where film crews like to stage scenes of drug deals going down. It has that look — all grit and graffiti. But there's also a tiny garden, growing in a square of dirt carved out of the sidewalk, where sunflowers and roses bloom in the summer.""

""That's all Garcia.""

Pesta described the precautions he took to avoid getting sick when the pandemic arrived. Working from home wasn't an option. ""He needed to support his family — his wife and two sons at home in Brooklyn, as well as his father, sister, and two nephews in Mexico. But he feared for his safety every time he walked into the building. 'For me to come to work every morning, I feel so afraid something will happen to me ,' he told me, noting that the virus has been especially deadly for Latino people like him.""

""One day in April, his wife, Matilde, felt sick after coming home from work at a corporate cafeteria. 'She had a bad fever and cough, but she didn't want to go to the hospital because she knew people were dying there,' Garcia recalled. Indeed, thousands of people had died across New York at this point, with new infections skyrocketing."" Their son also fell ill with the virus.

Though they thankfully recovered, Garcia's struggle to make ends meet is a constant, Pesta noted. ""He, like so many essential workers across America, lives on a knife edge.""",2021-03-07 00:00:00
Opinion: Biden's tricky tango with Congress,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) ""There are men of character in the U.S. Congress, both House and Senate. There are women of character, too. But the evidence for 'character' needs to be something other than the iteration of the word itself,"" writes Marjorie Garber in her book ""Character: The History of a Cultural Obsession.""

That is a useful frame for trying to make sense of the dramas that proliferated on Capitol Hill this week as Congress took up multiple nominations to President Joe Biden's Cabinet and held its first hearing on the January 6 insurrection. As Garber notes, the translation of individual traits into a ""national character"" most often occurs at ""times of stress, as a marker not so much of social progress as of social and cultural anxiety.""

We saw this. Conviction and commitment (and the lack of same), and in darker terms, eccentricity, hypocrisy and excuses made for bad behavior were on full display on the nation's highest political stage.

Dismissing hypocrisy with a laugh is part of what has left America's political discourse vulnerable to infiltration by dangerous conspiracy theories, wrotereacting to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson's remarks during hearings about the violent Capitol riots. He suggested, citing multiple discredited claims, that the day had a ""jovial,"" ""festive"" tone and that the assault had been a false-flag operation. As Ghitis pointed out: ""That conspiracy theories exist and are spreading is not news, but hearing them uttered by a US senator during an official congressional hearing marks a new low, one that demands we sit up and take notice. "" And because tens of millions of Americans ""believe the same thing[s]... by uttering that poisonous nonsense from the halls of Congress, Johnson is pumping more fuel into a dangerous fire.""

While no huge new revelations emerged during Tuesday's testimony about the US Capitol riots, the hearing sharpened the contours of the story, bringing into focus staggering security, defense and leadership failures,observed: ""There was no shortage of finger-pointing and blame-passing, but one big takeaway was clear: We've barely scratched the surface of what happened on one of the most ignominious days in American history.""

Andrea González-Ramírez, writing for Gen, noted of the nominees, all of whom would be history-making firsts in their positions if confirmed: ""I saw a familiar pattern develop. Regardless of their actual record and without even having a chance to discuss it, Meanwhile, Biden Cabinet nominees Neera Tanden (Office of Management and Budget), Deb Haaland (Interior) and Xavier Becerra (Health and Human Services) came under fierce questioning from Republicans, putting the focus on the need for support from key moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema if they are to be confirmed. In Tanden's case, the fate of her nomination was in doubt at week's end., writing for Gen, noted of the nominees, all of whom would be history-making firsts in their positions if confirmed: ""I saw a familiar pattern develop. Regardless of their actual record and without even having a chance to discuss it, nominees of color ... have been painted as 'famously partisan' people with 'radical' ideas ."" (González-Ramírez, joining a huge portion of the internet, also mentioned the hypocrisy of going after anyone in the Biden administration for ""mean"" tweets, given the behavior of the previous administration.)

Going big on relief

Colleen Doody wrote in the Washington Post's ""Made By History"" that much of the debate on that issue leaves out an important historical point borne out by the original New Deal minimum wage legislation: "" Some pandemic-era unemployment benefits are set to expire March 14, and the House kicked into high gear this week to advance the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package—which included a provision to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25.

Joseph Stiglitz argued that ""Congress must pass this legislation Rob Portman took issue with the package as overly massive and insufficiently bipartisan: ""The Biden administration's partisan approach repeats the same mistake that Barack Obama made early in his presidency.

A pandemic turning point?

Jonathan Reiner offered a reminder that big lies can be deadly: ""The January 6 attack on the United States Capitol was a vivid demonstration of the havoc that can result when a really big lie is repeatedly injected into the body politic.

David Andelman.

It may now understand the price it could pay for failing to respond to US overtures at diplomacy -- and continuing to back those militias.""

Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who died this week at 101, was the center of a literary revolution, remembered Tess Taylor. As a poet, the founder of City Lights and City Lights Press—respectively, a bookstore that democratized literature as the first to sell only paperbacks and a press that fought for free speech in its publication and defense in court of Allen Ginsberg's ""Howl"" -- Ferlinghetti was the crux of an ecosystem of poetry and culture that fostered generations of poets, including Taylor, and built a California world where words could thrive for all.",2021-02-28 00:00:00
Opinion: Ted Cruz isn't the only issue in Texas,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) ""O Gertrude, Gertrude,"" King Claudius says to his wife in Act IV of Hamlet. ""When sorrows come, they come not single spies. But in battalions."" A distraught Ophelia has just exited, leaving the royal couple worrying about her madness, the brooding of Gertrude's son Hamlet and their own fates.

Nearly a year ago, the Covid-19 pandemic began bringing death, disease and economic distress to millions of households. But the disaster hasn't come alone -- a host of others have struck the US in the past 12 months.

The 2020 hurricane season broke the record for the number of major storms, forcing meteorologists to dip into the Greek alphabet for new names. And this week freakish winter weather swept into the South, bringing record low temperatures to states such as Texas, Louisiana and Kentucky. At least 50 deaths have been attributed to the weather, including 10 hypothermia deaths in Harris County, which is home to Houston. Millions of people lost heat, power and access to food and clean water.

America isn't a failed state, Frida Ghitis noted, but ""the way it has 'handled' recent disasters, from the pandemic to the current weather crisis in Texas"", makes a ""mighty nation"" look like one.

As always in times of disaster, people turned to the government for help. The crisis brought into sharp relief politicians' mistakes, wrote Ghitis. ""Why are Texans freezing? There are many reasons, but this would not be happening if the state -- dominated by Republicans committed to a small government ideology -- had not severed its links to the national electrical grid for the sake of avoiding regulation. That regulation, among other things, would have required utilities to be better prepared . But Texas, the country's top energy producer...is the only state in the contiguous US essentially unable to borrow energy from other states.""

Ted Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, isn't in charge of keeping the lights on, but his decision to leave with his family for a vacation in Cancun on Wednesday was spectacularly ill-timed, prompting him to rush back and admit his mistake.

James C. Moore, ""Cruz boldly mocked California's electricity problems during their heatwave and fires, tweeting that the state was 'unable to perform even the basic functions of civilization, like having reliable electricity.' More hilariously, Cruz ridiculed the Austin mayor for flying to a Mexican beach during Covid after urging his city's residents to stay home. ""Last August,"" recalled, ""Cruz boldly mocked California's electricity problems during their heatwave and fires, tweeting that the state was 'unable to perform even the basic functions of civilization, like having reliable electricity.' More hilariously, Cruz ridiculed the Austin mayor for flying to a Mexican beach during Covid after urging his city's residents to stay home. Senator Sensitive will be performing his comedy act for at least four more years.

Adam Sobel, who studies extreme weather, wrote ""there is an ongoing, legitimate scientific debate"" about exactly what role global climate change plays in producing storms like this week's. Some in the media and government claimed that the Texas ""blackouts are happening because the state has too much renewable energy, and in particular because wind turbines are freezing. , who studies extreme weather, wrote ""there is an ongoing, legitimate scientific debate"" about exactly what role global climate change plays in producing storms like this week's. Some in the media and government claimed that the Texas ""blackouts are happening because the state has too much renewable energy, and in particular because wind turbines are freezing. Not true. While some wind turbines did freeze, the majority of the lost power was from coal, natural gas, and nuclear plants that went down . Wind accounts for only 10% of Texas's power during winter.""

Demonstrating that government can work effectively is key to the fortunes of President Joe Biden, wrote Julian Zelizer, who noted ""there has been considerable confusion over the plan to reopen schools and the administration's contradictory statements on the issue have already drawn criticism.""

After this week's weather in Texas, Biden ""declared a major disaster and ordered federal assistance, but what comes next will be key... Presidents are judged right off the bat by their ability to govern , implement policies and wield the levers of the federal government efficiently.""

Alok Sharma, the President of COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, welcomed the US ""back to the frontline of the global fight against climate change."" Its effects are all around us, Sharma wrote: ""melting glaciers, sea level rises, crop degradation, deforestation, and pollution choking some of the world's greatest cities... On Friday the US officially rejoined the Paris climate accord., the President of COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, welcomed the US ""back to the frontline of the global fight against climate change."" Its effects are all around us, Sharma wrote: ""melting glaciers, sea level rises, crop degradation, deforestation, and pollution choking some of the world's greatest cities... taking a heavy toll on human health, the destruction of homes and livelihoods, and an alarming loss of biodiversity .""

Hitting the road

Sandy Tolan and his wife Andrea Portes spent Christmas in Tucson and were planning to head home to Los Angeles when they decided they didn't want her to get on a plane in the midst of a pandemic to pick up their 11-year-old son, who was visiting his biological father in Florida. So, like many Americans these days, they decided driving cross country would be a safer bet.

""We focused on staying healthy, not an easy task when so many fellow citizens -- in gas stations, quick marts, even take-out restaurants -- refused to wear masks,"" Sandy Tolan wrote.

At a Subway in Arizona, ""a customer in front of me ignored the 'mandatory mask' sign. When I asked the employee why they didn't enforce wearing a mask, she just shrugged. At a Texas barbecue joint, as I waited for takeout in my 'Green Bay Football' sweatshirt, a man in a line of maskless bar patrons looked over, loudly proclaiming the Packers would lose that coming weekend. (Alas, he was correct.) But for the most part we faced little hostility. Sometimes people stared at us as if we were Martians....

""Nomadland,"" a film that is being touted for major awards this season, was filmed in 2018, long before anyone could foresee a road-trip boom provoked by a pandemic. ""Two years later Covid lockdowns would send sales of RVs and camper vans skyrocketing,"" wrote Sara Stewart. ""Suddenly, everyone wanted to hit the road in their own home on wheels -- because that felt like one of the only safe places to be.""

The movie stars Frances McDormand as a ""widowed and unemployed Nevadan who puts most of her belongings into storage and hits the road in her van, retrofitted to be a home on wheels. She drives around the US from work gig to work gig. One job is holiday-season packing at a gargantuan Amazon warehouse in Virginia, another harvesting sugar beets in North Dakota. Along the way, she connects and reconnects with like-minded travelers, older Americans who, for one reason or another, are living out of their vans and RVs, doing seasonal work and occasionally coming together to trade tips and celebrate nomad life."" The film, she said, is ""a masterpiece of natural beauty.""

In Vermont, Scott Langley was ""walking by a frozen lake, singing to his departed wife,"" wrote Thomas Lake.

He ""was 65, diabetic, nervously enduring the unknown period of time between this afternoon and the day he could get his coronavirus vaccination. He'd been up since 5:30, and had taken his medicine, gotten his 14-year-old daughter to school, worn two masks into Hannaford, resisted the urge to punch the maskless customer in the produce section. He ate a low-carb lunch and vigorously pedaled the exercise bike, trying to keep his blood glucose down, doing whatever he could to keep Ailyn from becoming an orphan.""

And the song he was singing was ""Some days are diamonds, some days are stone,"" an apt reflection of the hard times we're going through and the hope that keeps us going, wrote Lake.

Cuomo, Newsom and Covid-19

Last spring, New York's Andrew Cuomo and California's Gavin Newsom were feted as governors who had figured out how to fight Covid-19, in contrast to the Trump administration's erratic leadership. Cuomo wrote a book about it and even got an Emmy ""Founders Award"" for his daily pandemic briefings.

Now he's under fire for his handling of information on nursing home deaths, and Newsom is facing a potential recall vote.

""Late last month, New York State Attorney General Letitia James issued a scathing report about how nursing homes in the state handled Covid-19, including a finding that the state's Department of Health undercounted Covid deaths at nursing homes by approximately 50%,"" wrote Jennifer Rodgers.

When the Justice Department and state legislators asked for data on nursing homes, ""the Cuomo administration, according to a recent admission by a top Cuomo aide, delayed the release of the figures out of concern about a possible politically motivated federal investigation...If New Yorkers want transparency and accountability from this administration, our public integrity systems provide the tools to make that happen .""

Newsom's mistake was going to a birthday dinner for a lobbyist at the famous restaurant French Laundry, wrote Lincoln Mitchell. ""This occurred while California was under a partial lockdown and gatherings of a dozen people like this were forbidden, even if held outdoors."" Some Californians, including his Republican rivals, have never forgiven the governor for it. ""This was an enormous misstep by Newsom, for which he offered a less than entirely convincing apology.""

Now Republicans are helping collect signatures on petitions to force Newsom to undergo a recall vote, the year before he's eligible to run for reelection anyway. It's an overreaction, wrote Mitchell. The governor's record has been mixed, but on Covid, California's ""response under Newsom has been, relative to other states, about the middle of the pack or slightly better.

'Former guy' and Biden

For an hour on Tuesday evening, it was as if the last four years hadn't happened. In a CNN town hall hosted by Anderson Cooper, President Biden calmly set out his policy priorities, answered audience questions and reassured an 8-year-old girl that she had little reason to fear getting Covid-19. The biggest hint that he was succeeding a wildly controversial president came when Biden referred to the ""former guy"" and said, without naming him, that all the living former presidents but one had called him. (""I'm tired of talking about Donald Trump,"" Biden said at another point.)

Jill Filipovic. ""For so many, the Trump presidency was horrible and horrifying. It also garnered clicks and attention, outrage and fandom."" The media needs to ""cover this White House not as voyeurs obsessed with scandal and conflict, but as interpreters and checks on power who can hold this president accountable and explain what his policies and decisions actually mean for our day-to-day lives. ""The problem with radically changing norms of behavior in politics, and especially with making political life crasser and more shocking, is that it's hard to walk that back and sustain the public's attention,"" wrote. ""For so many, the Trump presidency was horrible and horrifying. It also garnered clicks and attention, outrage and fandom."" The media needs to ""cover this White House not as voyeurs obsessed with scandal and conflict, but as interpreters and checks on power who can hold this president accountable and explain what his policies and decisions actually mean for our day-to-day lives. And the rest of us need to act in kind and take on the responsibility of good citizenship...

Jeffrey D. Sachs, but taxes eventually will have to go up to help pay for it. "" Biden's top legislative priority now is the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. The relief is urgently needed, wrote, but taxes eventually will have to go up to help pay for it. "" Fortunately, we have many good places to raise tax revenues , starting with corporations that are flush with cash; billionaires who have hit the jackpot during Covid-19; and polluters who should bear the social costs of their damage to society.""

Our country began to realize that workers shouldn't sacrifice their health and the well-being of their family for a paycheck -- not during Covid, not ever .""

GOP civil war

Michael D'Antonio. "" The ""former guy"" tag is an effective way to counter Trump, wrote. "" Depriving Trump of attention hits him where it hurts . As President, and before that as a private businessman, Trump was an eager attention-seeker, steadily barraging the world with outrageous statements, conspiracy theories and other nonsense..."" But in Republican circles, where the former president's support is still substantial, ignoring Trump may not be an option.

Peggy Drexler wrote that ""families have been ripped apart by the turn politics has taken, and that Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who has blasted Trump, became the target of a letter from some of his relatives accusing him of joining ""the devil's army."" Psychologistwrote that ""families have been ripped apart by the turn politics has taken, and that much of blame lies with the former president, a longtime spokesmodel for conflict over comity .""

After voting to acquit Trump in the impeachment trial, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell put the blame squarely on him for whipping up the crowd that stormed the Capitol on January 6. The civil war among Republicans is now out in the open, with Trump issuing a statement excoriating McConnell.

Lanhee J. Chen wrote, ""McConnell's actions in the last several days... may seem confusing -- or just maddening -- to observers on both the right and the left, but they were not illogical or ill-conceived. He is doing all he can to ensure that he is in a position to wrote, ""McConnell's actions in the last several days... may seem confusing -- or just maddening -- to observers on both the right and the left, but they were not illogical or ill-conceived.

That means trying to block Senate candidates whose extreme pro-Trump views would alienate moderate voters.

There is no enlightened mystic at Mar-a-Lago -- ""Trumpism is the opposite of conservatism,"" wrote former Sen., a Republican. ""There is nothing to gain by making a pilgrimage to Florida.

Mars

On Thursday, NASA's Perseverance rover, launched last July, landed in the Jezero crater on Mars, ""which was once a river delta, disgorging into a lake,"" as physicist Don Lincoln pointed out.

It could lead to the biggest scientific discovery of its kind in four centuries: ""The discovery of life that evolved on a planet other than Earth would change humanity's understanding of its place in the cosmos . The last time such a paradigm-shifting advance occurred was in 1610, when Galileo first saw the moons of Jupiter, proving that the Earth (and, by extension, humanity) isn't at the center of the universe. And, since our celestial neighbor once hosted liquid water, it's an excellent location to look for ancient life.""

Rush Limbaugh

Nicole Hemmer, ""laid the groundwork for Trump's presidency."" Top Republicans ""essentially transformed Limbaugh into the de facto leader of their party -- Talk radio played a huge role in the rise of Donald Trump, the politician. And the master of that medium was Rush Limbaugh, who died this week at 70. Limbaugh's show, wrote historian, ""laid the groundwork for Trump's presidency."" Top Republicans ""essentially transformed Limbaugh into the de facto leader of their party -- and turned conservative media into a powerful political institution that carried as much weight as the party itself .""

""Limbaugh came to talk radio during the era of the shock jock, when hosts competed to see who could be the most outrageous,"" Hemmer noted. ""So he would level vicious attacks on people suffering from AIDS, or on the poor and homeless, and then, when greeted with outrage, say that his critics just weren't in on the joke.""

SE Cupp said in her weekly ""Unfiltered"" video that Limbaugh "" said in her weekly ""Unfiltered"" video that Limbaugh "" didn't just tap into populism, he exploited its worst undercurrents -- the grievances, the resentment, the anger, the racism, the bigotry, the xenophobia. He spent years fomenting it, turning neighbor against neighbor, American against American, giving permission to all his listeners to join him in devaluing the lives of others.""

Abraham Lincoln

Our colleague Breeanna Hare asked six historians from CNN's new series ""Lincoln: Divided We Stand"" for their thoughts on the lasting myths surrounding the 16th President.

Edna Greene Medford of Howard University observed that one of ""the more complicated and persistent historical beliefs is the one that credits Abraham Lincoln as having single-handedly 'freed the slaves.'"" With the Emancipation Proclamation, she wrote, ""he opened the door that led to the end of slavery throughout America. But that is only half of the story. Often missing in the emancipation narrative is the role others played in freeing enslaved people and ending the institution. In order for freedom to be realized, bondmen and women had to either make their way to the Union lines or be liberated by Northern soldiers and sailors. of Howard University observed that one of ""the more complicated and persistent historical beliefs is the one that credits Abraham Lincoln as having single-handedly 'freed the slaves.'""

Opinion: The one thing impeachment accomplished,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) On March 2, 1797, President George Washington wrote a letter comparing himself to a ""wearied traveler who sees a resting place, and is bending his body to lean thereon."" The idea of retiring after his controversy-filled second term was ""most grateful to my soul,"" Washington confided to his former secretary of war, Henry Knox.

""Tomorrow, at dinner, I shall as a servant of the public, take my leave of the President Elect,"" John Adams, ""...And the day following, with pleasure, I shall witness the inauguration of my Successor.""

The first president was also the first person to hand over the power of his office peacefully, setting the template for more than two centuries of such transfers. That tradition was put at risk for the first time on January 6, when a mob invaded the US Capitol seeking to stop the final certification of Joe Biden's election victory. This week former president Donald Trump went on trial in the Senate, accused of setting the stage for that event, and was acquitted two days before the Presidents Day holiday that honors George Washington. All 50 Democrats and seven Republicans voted against Trump, but that fell short of the 67 votes needed to convict him.

Whatever else it may have accomplished, the impeachment trial surely burned the memory of the Capitol riot into American history forever. House impeachment managers wove together horrifying videos, some seen publicly for the first time—along with Trump's speeches and tweets around the election and its aftermath—to present a timeline of a president who pushed a big lie that the election was rigged, helped assemble and ignite an angry crowd and sent it toward the Capitol, just as Congress was doing its constitutional duty.

""The then-President knew that the crowd he had summoned was prone to violence,"" wrote Doug Jones, a former US senator from Alabama. ""He even retweeted some of their posts and amplified their violent and divisive rhetoric. This was a crowd ready to start a revolution in Trump's name, and he knew it.""

Jones, a former federal prosecutor, observed, ""I never dreamed I would see what happened in this country on January 6. I never dreamed that I would see a president stoke the flames of hate to cause a siege of the US Capitol with Congress in session. If Trump's actions are not impeachable, then nothing is, and we may as well strike that provision from the Constitution .""

David Axelrod wrote. ""Though he avoided sanction, the trial imposed a more enduring penalty on him by laying bare for the world and history his craven role in orchestrating the seditious mayhem at the Capitol."" Even though he was acquitted, "" this was far from a triumph for Trump ,""wrote. ""Though he avoided sanction, the trial imposed a more enduring penalty on him by laying bare for the world and history his craven role in orchestrating the seditious mayhem at the Capitol.""

Laura Coates argued. ""On Friday, senators recognized Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman's courage and gave him a standing ovation for risking his own life to save theirs on January 6,"" she noted. ""A day later, In a speech on the Senate floor Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned Trump's actions before and during the riot, but he was among the Republicans who voted to acquit on the grounds, disputed by many legal experts, that the Senate doesn't have the power to try former officials. Those lawmakers shirked their responsibility,argued. ""On Friday, senators recognized Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman's courage and gave him a standing ovation for risking his own life to save theirs on January 6,"" she noted. ""A day later, when it came time for the senators themselves to show courage, however, they folded .""

But this time he was one of the people who had to run for his life -- and hide in a Capitol office. A day before the impeachment trial got underway, he offered a chilling account of his experience. ""My heart beats in my ears. A knot in my stomach holds me down,"" he wrote. ""I feel like I am finally in the shoes of any number of shooting survivors I've interviewed over the years.

At about 6 pm, hours after the Capitol was stormed, Trump tweeted, ""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!""

Seth Rogen's cause

For 15 years, Seth Rogen and his wife, Lauren Miller Rogen, wrestled with the heartbreak of her mom's struggle with Alzheimer's. ""It took her as it takes so many -- bit by bit, day by day, slowly robbing her of her thoughts, her memories and those corny jokes she loved to tell,"" they wrote.

""As part of her care team, we learned what it meant to parent a parent as the illness cheated Lauren's mother of her ability to do for herself the daily tasks we take for granted, from eating to bathing to dressing."" They learned ""that government and most employers provide people -- especially young people with little to no caregiving resources. We learned the ugly truth that the US is the only industrialized nation without a national paid family leave policy to help people balance care for older loved ones while working.""

In 2012, the Rogens founded HFC, a nonprofit which stands for Hilarity for Charity, to help fill the gap in care, and are advocating legislation to expand paid family and medical leave.

Too much salmon

In Bill Burton's household, March 13, 2020 was ""the last day the kids had school, the day of our last in-person meetings and the last day I wore dress shoes."" That means they marked their ""1,000th meal in captivity"" with Wednesday's breakfast. As with many families, cooking at home has become a constant.

""Who knows how many thousands of eggs, pounds of ground turkey and boxes of wheat rotini we've gone through...but the upside is that we learn more about each other every single day. For example, about 40 weeks in, after baking salmon on a weekly rotation, I learned my wife does not, in fact, like salmon,"" wrote Burton, former deputy White House press secretary and special assistant to President Barack Obama. The other upside was having ""a loving family to share this isolation with.""

This week's news on Covid-19 was encouraging, as cases continue to drop around the nation -- and world. The speed of vaccinations in the US is increasing, though still only a small proportion of the population is fully protected. Another encouraging sign -- the feared ""twindemic"" of a major flu outbreak coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic hasn't materialized, as Dr. Kent Sepkowitz noted. The question is that no one knows for sure why the flu numbers have been so low.

""A substantial part of the difference in controlling the two viruses may derive from a simple fact : our immune systems have dealt with flu every year for decades, whereas this strain of coronavirus is altogether new to our lymphocytes and other components of our immune response,"" Sepkowitz wrote.

Nicholas Christakis While progress is being made against the pandemic, ""normal"" life isn't returning anytime soon. predicted in a CNN Opinion video that full recovery from the pandemic won't be reached until 2024.

Valentine's and Galentine's

Nicole Hemmer pointed out.

""Of all the made-up holidays that sitcoms have graced us with — Friendsgiving, Festivus, Chrismukkah — none is more wholesome or more necessary than Galentine's Day .""

Hemmer traced the evolution of Galentine's Day to the ""popularity of ladies' nights,"" which became ""a central part of the debate about feminism in the 1970s and 1980s. And the core of that debate took place at the most unexpected of places: Chippendales. Yes, that Chippendales. The male dance revue where men stripped down to padded thongs while throngs of women gasped and ogled and cheered.""

Reopening schools

When Natasha S. Alford's mother, a teacher in Syracuse, NY, was diagnosed with Covid-19, her daughter saw her ""lesson planning instead of resting."" She kept ""typing away at the computer between light coughs, as I pleaded with her to take the day off immediately."" Fortunately, Alford's mother recovered, but the situation points to the huge demands the pandemic is placing on teachers, students and parents.

""Her students and others across the country already faced impossible hurdles, from shaky WiFi connections to challenging home situations, in which some parents were required to work and leave their children unsupervised,"" Alford pointed out. ""Some kids slept through the alarm set for them to wake up and log on. Others tried their best to keep up, but missed the hands-on instruction needed to help them learn complex material and were very clearly falling behind. And still a select few thrived in a virtual setting, eagerly consuming lessons and executing assignments.""

Justin Timberlake's apology

Marcie Bianco. A New York Times documentary cast a harsh light on the way Britney Spears has been treated by fellow celebrities including Justin Timberlake and the media. It ""put a laser focus on how so many men have capitalized, for their own career success, on both society's pleasure in consuming accounts of women's suffering and our propensity for denigrating 'nasty women,' "" wrote

The documentary exposed, ""in new ways and for new audiences the extent to which Spears' health and career suffered as she was hounded by the media and battled with her father, with whom she has been in a multi-year legal battle for control of her life."" Timberlake appeared to have benefited from the breakup of his relationship with Spears. The effect, ""Britney's downfall, Justin's ascent -- was replicated a few years later, this time, with Spears's idol, Janet Jackson as Timberlake's foil,"" as a result of the ""wardrobe malfunction"" in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show.

""With the documentary's release and calls for his response and apology on social media,"" Bianco wrote, ""the opportunity has presented itself for Timberlake to fully take responsibility for his actions. Without accountability, there no end in sight to the many forms of misogyny that continue to injure women."" On Friday Timberlake posted a statement that he was ""deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem"" and apologized to Spears and Jackson.",2021-02-14 00:00:00
Donald Trump: The undoing of his presidency (opinion),"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) When Sen. Patrick Leahy gavels in the impeachment trial of the 45th President of the United States Tuesday, the 46th President will be nearly three weeks into his four-year term. Whether or not the Senate convicts Donald Trump of ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Joe Biden is already well on his way to undoing much of what his predecessor did.

The list is stunning: Biden has instituted a national mask mandate and increased the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines; announced the US would rejoin the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accord; ended the emergency diversion of funds to build a wall on the Mexico border; extended an arms control agreement with Russia and reversed Trump administration policies on immigration, on racial equity and on banning transgender members of the military.

As historianpointed out, Biden's more than 40 executive orders, actions and memorandums have drawn criticism but they are "" part of a deliberate strategy to project a new vision for the country , and it makes sense for him to use the power he has in this way. In fact, Biden and his team are modeling their first 100 days in office after the example of one former president in particular: Franklin D. Roosevelt."" FDR moved swiftly to confront the Great Depression in his first 100 days in office.

Biden is pushing for a massive $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package amid debate about whether it's what the Covid-scarred economy needs.urged Biden to take seriously a proposal by Republican senators for a much smaller relief package if he wants to gain bipartisan support for other legislative priorities and in light of a slowly recovering economy. ""Recent economic data makes the case for more targeted relief,"" Chen wrote. ""Unemployment is slowly but steadily declining and the size of the civilian labor market should be in 2022 what it was before the pandemic.""

Vicky Chávez is paying close attention to the change of government in Washington. She has been living with her two children in a Salt Lake City church that offered her sanctuary three years ago when an immigration judge rejected her request for asylum. Her family faced deportation to Honduras. Watching Biden's inauguration, her 3-year-old daughter asked, ""Does this mean we can go to Disneyland?"" As Anna Lekas Miller wrote, Chavez answered, ""Not yet. But hopefully soon.""

If Biden really wants to send a message to asylum-seekers that his administration is the new beginning that he promised,"" Miller observed, ""he should also grant those living in sanctuary the protection they need to leave church safely and ensure that they will be able to stay in the country until they are on a viable path to citizenship.""

On trial...again

Donald Trump's trial in the Senate over the Capitol riot begins a year and four days after he was acquitted in that chamber of using his power to press Ukraine's president to launch an investigation of Biden. The lone Republican who voted to convict Trump, Mitt Romney, said then, in words that turned out to be prophetic, ""Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.""

Michael D'Antonio. ""Failure to call witnesses who could offer first-person accounts of the Trump insurrection The Republican-controlled Senate refused to call witnesses in the trial. Democrats, who now run the chamber, shouldn't make the same mistake, wrote. ""Failure to call witnesses who could offer first-person accounts of the Trump insurrection would be prosecutorial misconduct . Including them would likely draw a bigger TV audience among Americans who want to hear fellow citizens, not politicians, explain how Trump incited the mob that then waged a bloody attack and occupation of the US Capitol.""

Julian Zelizer. ""Through Twitter and rallies, the former president filled our airwaves with lies about voter fraud and spurious claims of his victory. This was an extraordinarily dangerous use of the bully pulpit that Trump's home is now Mar-a-Lago instead of the White House, and the odds that 67 senators will vote to convict him are slim, but the trial is vital anyway to establish for history's sake the rightful curbs on presidential power, wrote. ""Through Twitter and rallies, the former president filled our airwaves with lies about voter fraud and spurious claims of his victory. This was an extraordinarily dangerous use of the bully pulpit that aimed to do nothing less than overturn the legitimate results of an election by stoking anger, hatred and distrust in the electorate.""

Elie Honig. ""For example, per the American Bar Association, it would be unethical for any attorney to raise an argument 'that he knows to be false.' The 'rigged election' narrative certainly fits that description."" Five of Trump's impeachment lawyers withdrew amid reports that Trump wanted to re-up his discredited claim that massive voter fraud accounted for his defeat in November. ""There are limits on what a defense attorney can argue,"" wrote. ""For example, per the American Bar Association, it would be unethical for any attorney to raise an argument 'that he knows to be false.' The 'rigged election' narrative certainly fits that description.""

Senate Republicans have signaled that a more politically palatable defense will be to argue that the Constitution never envisioned a former official being tried after leaving office. The one counter-example was the 1876 impeachment trial on corruption allegations of former Secretary of War William Belknap, who served in President Ulysses S. Grant's administration.

As the Senate's website notes , ""On March 2, 1876, just minutes before the House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on articles of impeachment, Belknap raced to the White House, handed Grant his resignation, and burst into tears.""

Tim Naftali wrote that when the Belknap trial came to the Senate, then under a Republican majority, ""the issue of whether it was constitutional gave the president's supporters, along with senators who were against outlawing official corruption, an easy out."" There's a danger of a similar outcome this time, he wrote, warning the Trump case could result in a wrote that when the Belknap trial came to the Senate, then under a Republican majority, ""the issue of whether it was constitutional gave the president's supporters, along with senators who were against outlawing official corruption, an easy out."" There's a danger of a similar outcome this time, he wrote, warning the Trump case could result in a ""a zombie Senate trial that mindlessly sleepwalks to an acquittal.""

What happens to Trump after the trial? Larry Tye suggested that an apt parallel is the fate of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the red-baiter who terrorized public life in the early 1950s until he chose ""an enemy too big to bully, the mighty US Army, the most stouthearted and sacrosanct institution in America, and which had just waged a lethal war on the Korean Peninsula against Communists.""

The Senate voted to condemn McCarthy. ""Newspapers banished him to page 25, next to the corset ads, or wrote him out entirely. So did his Senate colleagues. Being subjected to a punishment so extreme that it had been meted out just five times in that chamber's 165 years, meant trading in the badge of the outlier, which McCarthy had proudly worn from his first days in office, for the stigmata of the shunned that made him the butt of even the president's jokes .""

Marjorie Taylor Greene

For the moment though, Trump's influence remains strong within the Republican Party. The House GOP conference refused to strip extremist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments after CNN's KFile revealed the lies and incendiary language the freshman Congresswoman from northwest Georgia had been spreading on social media.

The House Democrats who are in the majority then voted to remove Greene's committee roles, with the support of 11 Republicans.

Alice Stewart, ""and it's about time the party hit the reset button... We need to turn the page on the Trump brand of outlandish and embarrassing leadership, and Thursday's vote was a step in the right direction. We need to focus on conservative policies, not a cult of personalities."" ""Greene's toxic talk creates a huge headache for the GOP,"" wrote Republican, ""and it's about time the party hit the reset button... We need to turn the page on the Trump brand of outlandish and embarrassing leadership, and Thursday's vote was a step in the right direction. We need to focus on conservative policies, not a cult of personalities.""

Bond, who formerly headed the Republican National Committee, wrote that "" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke out against ""loony lies and conspiracy theories"" this week, calling them a ""cancer for the Republican Party,"" while praising Rep. Liz Cheney, a GOP leader who voted to impeach Trump., who formerly headed the Republican National Committee, wrote that "" McConnell knows that the GOP is at a tipping point. Republicans can continue to embrace Trump's toxicity and big-lie tactics and continue to coddle extremists. Or, they can, like the fictional newscaster Howard Beale in 'Network,' declare that they are mad as hell, are not going to take it anymore, and are going to change their ways and reclaim their party.""

Frida Ghitis. ""It is a flashing red light for the entire country, warning America that if it continues on this path, it will become a country without guardrails against extremist ideologies. This is not just a Republican problem, observed. ""It is a flashing red light for the entire country, warning America that if it continues on this path, it will become a country without guardrails against extremist ideologies. We have seen how that has played out in other countries and it doesn't bode well for the US.

History provides a parallel, wrote Zachary Karabell in Politico. In the mid-19th century, he noted, ""The American Party, popularly referred to as the 'Know Nothings,' "" controlled statehouses and had more than 40 members in the House. ""Most of them supported stringent nativist, anti-immigrant legislation; all emerged from conspiratorial clubs that had spread theories about possible Papist aggression and plots against the sovereignty of the United States."" But then the movement fractured.

""The sudden implosion of the Know Nothings should also serve as a warning to Republicans that the forces that have propelled them to the apex of American politics, helping Donald Trump win the White House, can also tear them apart, leaving barely a trace.

The hunt for vaccines

Last week we asked readers to share their stories of the search for Covid vaccine appointments in a nation where the demand far outstrips the supply. As Jhodie-Ann Williams and Jane Greenway Carr wrote, ""nearly 1,400 readers shared stories with us about efforts to get vaccinated, writing candidly about everything from waking up at dawn to try to secure a spot in that day's vaccine allotment to having appointments canceled at the last minute.""

""Sprinkled in there were success stories, but most of them were, as many readers put it, because of sheer luck -- getting on the right website, on the right day and pressing 'submit' or 'enter' at just the right time. For many, navigating the system to try to get an appointment has proven to be, at best, confusing and -- because of delays -- at worst, deadly.

A month after Jan. 6

When David J. Morris watched the Capitol riot play out on Jan. 6, he was particularly disgusted by the presence of ""serious-looking guys outfitted in tactical gear, wearing unit patches and insignia that I recognized."" Morris, a Marine veteran, wrote that he was shocked but not surprised by the substantial number of ""middle-aged military veterans, i.e. guys like me.""

I'd seen a lot of white nationalism during my eight years in uniform ; it essentially bookended my military career,"" Morris observed. ""Like the Republican Party, the US military has for years coddled, looked the other way, winked at, joked about and generally not taken white nationalism seriously enough in its ranks for a very long time."" Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered the military to focus on the issue, in a staggered pause of operations over the next two months, the Pentagon said this week.

Michelle Duster watched the riot, she thought of her great-grandmother Ida B. Wells who exposed the wave of lynchings of Black Americans. ""As I watched the mob of so-called 'patriots' storm the Capitol with minimal law enforcement present, the fact that some of the vigilantes had plastic zip ties and weapons and walked away unharmed was mind-boggling.

It is both a sacrifice and a privilege. It is real and binding... Officer Sicknick, along with his fellow sworn officers, fought literally to defend the Constitution. In upholding their oath, they may have saved America. In that, there is nobility.""

Amanda Gorman and Phillis Wheatley

Before there was Amanda Gorman, the poet who captivated America at the Inauguration, there was Phillis Wheatley, an enslaved American whose poetry was published in 1773 in London, noted Manisha Sinha.

""A genius by any standard,"" Wheatley ""was educated by her enslavers who had lost a daughter her age. Wheatley learned English and Latin and wrote her first poem four years later. So remarkable was the story of the young slave poet that a bevy of Boston worthies, including John Hancock, examined her and testified to the authenticity of her poems to confirm what many surely doubted -- that a young enslaved Black girl could produce such polished work."" There was also ""unabashed, racist criticism,"" from Thomas Jefferson and others.

Amid nearly universal praise, Gorman's work has been the target of a takedown in the Spectator, which Sinha called ""staggeringly patronizing."" She added, "" Gorman shares Wheatley's clear-eyed view of the trials that Black people faced in the slaveholding republic.""

Peniel E. Joseph. "" This year's Black History Month has special resonance, wrote. "" At a critical time, it offers the nation a window into its own soul -- if we are only courageous enough to look... The racial disparities so terribly evident in the Covid-19 pandemic and the most divisive presidential election in American history are rooted in circumstances that can best be explained, analyzed and interrogated through the lens of Black history.""

Navalny's sentence

In a Moscow courtroom, against the backdrop of street protests, Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was sentenced Tuesday to two and a half years in prison. Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov wrote, ""His supposed crime was a probation violation committed while he was in a coma in Berlin after being poisoned by the same state security forces that have locked him up again.""

Western governments were swift to condemn Vladimir Putin's regime for the treatment of Navalny. Those denunciations ""would be heartening if they did not sound nearly identical to those issued when Navalny was poisoned last August,"" Kasparov noted.

""With every act of appeasement Putin has gone from a local problem to a regional menace to a global threat. Germany thinks it can criticize Russia on human rights while going ahead with the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that will fill Putin's pockets with cash and his military's guns with bullets. Those bullets are used against Europeans in Ukraine and, God forbid, against Russians in the streets. Europe thinks it can separate business and politics, but to Putin it's all the same: business.

Opinion: Marjorie Taylor Greene and the Trump legacy,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) Congress was convulsed by controversy over the incendiary behavior of a freshman Republican from Georgia. Wall Street was roiled by insurgent amateurs trading in GameStop stock to punish giant hedge funds. But in a week of extremes, the biggest underlying story -- and the central challenge facing the Biden administration -- was the race to save tens of thousands of lives at risk to Covid-19.

On average, more than 3,000 Americans are dying of the disease every day. If the pace of vaccinations is scaled up, the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model projects, that toll will drop to less than 1,000 by May 1. If 95% of the population wears masks, it will fall even further -- to less than 500. But with more transmissible variants of Covid-19 spreading, there's a risk the outcome will be much worse.

""The new year has brought a fresh raft of concerns in the ongoing struggle to contain the Covid-19 pandemic ,"" wrote Dr.. ""The coronavirus is mutating into new variants and some have displayed characteristics that have unsettled public health officials and the public at large."" Still, he cautioned that research on the variants is preliminary, and it's unclear whether they make the disease deadlier and significantly reduce the vaccines' protections.

Aside from wearing masks and social distancing, the vaccines are the best defense against the coronavirus, with two of them showing efficacy greater than 90% in clinical trials and others in the pipeline that offer more protection than influenza vaccines typically do. Yet only a small proportion of Americans are eligible to get one and many of those people haven't been able to line up appointments.

, who lives in Michigan with her husband and two children, has been the lifeline for her parents in Maricopa County, Arizona. Her dad is 81 and her mom is 74. ""Navigating the system proved to be a challenge,"" she wrote. "" I can't imagine what seniors without someone to help them figure out the vaccine scheduling process go through ; the online systems, hold times for phone calls, waking early to try to get appointments could make anyone frustrated, especially the senior community that so desperately needs to be vaccinated.""

Kendall Ciesemier was born with a rare liver disease and, in her 27 years, has had two liver transplants. Even though the US Health and Human Services Department encourages states to classify immunocompromised people like Ciesemier as a priority for vaccination in the same category as those over 65, many have not yet done so.

It is as a volunteer sexual assault and domestic crisis advocate in New York City hospitals that she qualifies for a vaccine. ""I can't help but be struck by the irony of the situation. The reason I qualify ... has nothing to do with my lifelong health challenges, but rather my extracurricular status as a health care volunteer. It's not the reason I'd die, but it's the reason I'm seen by our government as important enough to save .""

When the pandemic broke out a year ago, Bill and Melinda Gates closed the offices of their foundation, which has spent billions to improve health around the world, and began working from home. ""For us, the days became a blur of video meetings, startling news alerts, and microwaved meals — and we are well aware of how lucky we are compared to others,"" they wrote. ""Over the past year, Covid-19 has killed over two million people worldwide, sickened millions more, and thrust the global economy into a devastating recession.""

Until Covid, "" 'global health' was a term that people in rich countries used to refer to the health of people in non-rich countries ,"" they noted. ""But in 2020, a virus that had no regard for borders or geography upended lives all over the world, collapsing some of those distinctions between rich countries and poor countries."" Now there's a greater chance people realize we're in it together.

Trump legacy and Marjorie Taylor Greene

Even before Marjorie Taylor Greene was elected as a freshman member of Congress in November, the Republican from northwest Georgia was known for her embrace of the groundless QAnon conspiracy theory. But this week the full measure of her extreme beliefs came into focus when CNN's KFile reported that in Facebook posts from 2018 and 2019 Greene had repeatedly shown support for executing Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

What's even worse is that ""hundreds of her congressional Republican colleagues have stayed silent about it,"" wrote Elliot Williams. ""The reality is that her political party has been hijacked by the conspiracy theorist fringe she represents. A vocal element of the party, with Greene as its drum major, has neutered the party's leadership, and rendered it incapable of condemning even obvious threats to others' safety.""

It fits with the 45 Republican senators who signaled that they would likely vote to acquit former President Donald Trump in his upcoming impeachment trial, according to Williams. ""If unrefuted revelations of online behavior calling for murder are not enough for a member of Congress to be asked to resign immediately, what is? Likewise, if using the power of the presidency to subvert and obstruct the certification of election results, and -- if that weren't enough -- to whip up a mob that attacked the seat of American democracy, leading to a police officer's death, isn't disqualifying from future office, nothing is .""

SE Cupp called Greene ""among Donald Trump's worst legacies"" and noted the surfacing of a video this week showing her harassing a victim of the Parkland school shooting.

On Wednesday the Department of Homeland Security put out a bulletin warning of a ""heightened threat environment"" and expressing concern that the Capitol insurrection could have ""emboldened"" extremists. With that riot, wrote former CIA director and Defense Secretary, ""America crossed a line. Few thought it was possible in the 21st century: American terrorists attacked and occupied the US Capitol and brought our democracy to a halt. We were again at war with terrorism, only this time it was homegrown. "" He argued that Jan. 6 needs to be a wakeup call about the domestic terror threat, as 9/11 was about terrorism aimed at the US from abroad.

Irene Butter arrived in the US in 1945 at the age of 15, a refugee from the Holocaust. ""Finally, in America, I had choices and could exercise my free will,"" she wrote for CNN Opinion in connection with International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, where she grew up, in her new country ""there were no restrictions. No yellow stars on clothing. No men with guns stopping people to see papers. Only opportunity. Now, 75 years later, I see something I never imagined: echoes of the Nazis and their regime. What happened in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, was an attempted coup of our government and an unraveling of the democracy that protects all of our rights.

A big mistake, argued. ""The poorly understood history of the Fairness Doctrine shows not only that reinstating it won't fix current political media crises, but also that it won't be the check on conservative media's worst offenses that so many want it to be."" A better answer would be ""a creative, comprehensive effort by both the private sector and the government to disincentivize conspiracies and misinformation on the many platforms on which they flourish.""

Gaming Wall Street

Like all Wall Street crazes, this will likely not end well. But for a time this week, noted Frida Ghitis, small online traders drove up the stock of the troubled retailer GameStop in a show of force. ""Members of an online forum on the social media platform Reddit and Wall Street financiers, who had bet heavily on the failure of the company...clashed in what amounted to financial warfare. The online youngsters headbutted the traders, drawing financial blood in the process.""

It's worth looking at the context, wrote Ghitis. ""The forces fueling the emotions and the mechanics of the clash are not unlike what we've seen in other confrontations in recent months . Social media as the organizing environment; a sense of frustration against the establishment; a belief that some sort of injustice is benefitting the powerful, and a newfound source of strength, a way to attack, to inflict fear and pain on those viewed as responsible, or at least benefitting from that injustice.""

Later in the afternoon, though, you look to the horizon and see the Earth hemorrhaging gray dust as trucks haul coal from pits the size of suburbs."" The region produces 40% of US coal, but now is threatened by the policies of the Biden administration, which is rejoining the Paris climate accords and promising a 100% clean-power electric grid in less than 15 years.

""Moving away from coal is essential to fighting back against worsening droughts, storms and sea-level rise around the world,"" Sutter wrote. But don't forget the harm it will do to people in places like Gillette. Biden should say ""workers will not be left behind. That means they should get job training, health care, wage replacement and, when possible, jobs in the new industries that are popping up to replace fossil fuels.""

Paul Begala. The senator is ending the streak, now that there's a new administration promising to focus on the issue. "" For nine years -- and 279 times -- Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island has risen on the Senate floor to warn America of the risks of climate change, noted. The senator is ending the streak, now that there's a new administration promising to focus on the issue. "" I just want to salute the man who, day in and day out, raised his voice to save the planet,"" Begala wrote.

Harriet Tubman and racial equity

Among a flood of executive actions from Joe Biden this week were four focused on racial equity, wrote historian Peniel Joseph, who credited him for a ""laser focus on racial justice,"" unseen ""at least since Reconstruction or Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.""

In an important symbolic move, he observed, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced plans to speed up the launch of $20 bills bearing the image of abolitionist Harriet Tubman's. ""It represents a much needed acknowledgment of the way in which racial slavery helped to create the wealth of this nation and much of the world...Biden seems to understand that this is the kind of truth America must recognize in order to create public policies that leverage justice to produce healing ."" Black History Month begins Monday.

Cicely Tyson

Cicely Tyson captivated audiences in the 1970s with her performances in ""Roots,"" ""Sounder,"" and ""The Autobiography of Jane Pittman."" Sherrilyn Ifill recalled seeing her ""when we were at the age where girls often feel ugly, awkward, self-critical. For brown-skinned Black girls in the 70s, the African-ness of our looks left our beauty, or even our aspirations to beauty, in debate. The color of our skin, our broad noses, the texture of our hair -- despite the strong 'Black is beautiful' moment -- were not the standard of beauty presented on television where we saw ourselves only rarely in prominent roles...""

Her career endured. Remarkably, Tyson starred on Broadway at the age of 88 in ""The Trip to Bountiful"" in 2013, winning a Tony Award. She died Thursday.

Ifill observed, ""A legend has left us. But what she gave us transformed the self-image of millions of Black women and girls. She is the artistic mother of Lupita and Viola and so many of the Black actresses today who walk in the path she so blazed. Her art enriched us all and remains with us still.""",2021-01-31 00:00:00
Opinion: Four presidents take a stand,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) On Wednesday, three men wearing overcoats stood in the amphitheater of Arlington National Cemetery, grouped at a pandemic-proper social distance as American flags whipped in the wind behind them.

In the center was former President George W. Bush and alongside him were former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. They had just attended President Joe Biden's inauguration and were here to pledge their support to him in front of the American people.

""The fact that the three of us are here talking about a peaceful transfer of power speaks to the institutional integrity of our country,"" said Bush, a Republican, in a video that was broadcast that evening. The tradition of such a transfer, Obama, a Democrat, pointed out, is ""over two centuries old.""

You wouldn't know from the harmony of their appeal that a little over 20 years ago, Bush had promised an administration, in contrast to Clinton's, that ""will appeal to our better angels, not our darker impulses"" or that Obama had told Americans who were out of work in 2008 to blame ""the failed policies of George W. Bush.""

The three men, now friends and members in good standing of the Presidents Club, were a symbolic affirmation of the central themes of Biden's inaugural address — that ""democracy has prevailed"" and ""we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue."" But the real test of Biden's call for unity is what happens now — as the new President seeks Congress' support for Covid-19 relief and the Senate weighs how to try the impeached (for the second time) former President Donald Trump, who flew out of town the morning of the inauguration.

""The occasion took on a surreal feeling,"" wrote SE Cupp. ""It was a throwback to an earlier era, an era before 'American carnage.' Gone were the anger and division. No one suggested America needed to be made great again. The air of fraught anxiety had lifted. Even the US Capitol building didn't show the scars of its insurrection just two weeks ago.""

But it's no time to be complacent, she warned. ""The last four years have tattooed a trauma on so many Americans, and it won't fade overnight . There's healing to do, and Biden has a long journey ahead.""

Van Jones, noting both the swearing in of Kamala Harris as the first woman elected to national office and Biden's speech. ""He acknowledged and honored the cry for racial justice, 400 years in the making. He reached out to young people and people who are suffering. He promised to be a President for all Americans."" ""We just hit the biggest reset button in history,"" wrote, noting both the swearing in of Kamala Harris as the first woman elected to national office and Biden's speech. ""He acknowledged and honored the cry for racial justice, 400 years in the making. He reached out to young people and people who are suffering. He promised to be a President for all Americans.""

Different this time?

David Gergen has worked as an adviser to four presidents. He's heard calls for unity before, but this time may be different. ""I came away from his inaugural address thinking we may finally have a president who can pull us back from the brink.

""I came away from his inaugural address thinking we may finally have a president who can pull us back from the brink. There is something about the man that is compelling — the fire in his soul, his humility, his clear moral purpose .""

Lanhee Chen endorsed Biden's call to end the ""uncivil war"" and wrote, ""If our new president is able to do as he says and Republicanendorsed Biden's call to end the ""uncivil war"" and wrote, ""If our new president is able to do as he says and restore even some respect to the very real debates we are sure to have with one another, he will have been a success.""

Jill Filipovic. The end of Trump's presidency was a relief for ""I can finally feel myself beginning to unclench my jaw, drop my shoulders, and exhale,"" she wrote. ""The past four years have felt like a lifetime ... The news out of the White House will be slower, and almost certainly more boring. Adults will be in charge again — too late for so many, but hopefully in time to speed up a vaccine rollout and save thousands of lives. Simple values like honesty, accountability, decency and empathy will return.""

Doug Heye observed that GOP strategist and former congressional staff memberobserved that there's no ""guarantee of success"" for Biden . ""These things are hard even in normal times, even when we agree."" But the chances are better with Biden given ""his long career and deep relationships on Capitol Hill.""

David Axelrod recalled Mitch McConnell's words to President Obama in 2009 at their first private meeting with congressional leaders at the White House. ""A lot of us don't think you should be here, but you won and we're prepared to work with you,"" Axelrod quoted McConnell as saying.

But in fact, ""Resistance became the stratagem of choice for McConnell.""

Julian Zelizer noted that it was not a given that democracy would prevail. ""What was extraordinary about the past few weeks was just how frail our constitutional system can be in an era of intense polarization and when one party has been radicalized. When a President and his party are willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve and retain power, it's possible that the system we cherish won't function.

Had Republicans controlled the House of Representatives or had the election been closer, it isn't hard to imagine how the effort to overturn the results might have been successful.

Credit for averting disaster belongs to American voters, judges, election officials, journalists, a majority of legislators, military leaders and police officers like Eugene Goodman, who was honored at the Inauguration after he ""heroically moved the rioters from where US senators were hiding during the electoral vote certification process,"" Zelizer noted.

Surviving Covid-19

Last week, as the disease continued to spread and claim lives, she got some good news: ""A Covid-19 patient of mine told me he is finally going home after four months in the hospital.

On a larger scale, she also sees positive news. ""Biden announced a new team of scientific advisers and created a Cabinet position for the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.

And, as Thomas Lake wrote, the mental health challenges posed by the long lockdowns and the deaths of more than 400,000 Americans won't be easy to overcome. ""When this is over we will all need help. We already do now. Some of us will get it. Most will not, whether for lack of time or money or motivation. There are not enough counselors to sift through the layers of mental and emotional wreckage and give us all the attention we need.

There are things we can do to help ourselves and each other. Tell your friends you love them. Tell them your troubles and listen to theirs. Show up for those family Zoom calls, whether or not you feel like it."" Lake quoted Dr. Erica Martin Richards, a psychiatrist and a medical director at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, who noted: ""There are studies that show the importance of smiling. The importance of prayer. The importance of exercising."" Lake added, ""She regularly does all three.""

To, one category was particularly worth noting ""because of how it threatens our system of checks and balances , and what it reveals about the man behind the power: the pardoning of people found guilty of public corruption offenses.

Elie Honig, among ""the most odious of the pardons and commutations that Trump granted in his final hours"" were To, among ""the most odious of the pardons and commutations that Trump granted in his final hours"" were those to his former adviser Steve Bannon, Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy, former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and Paul Erickson , ""convicted of wire fraud and money laundering as an offshoot of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.""

What comes next

Bernie Sanders' appearance at the inauguration — in — went viral, birthing a million memes, but his thoughts on the road ahead are also worth noting, since he's going to be the new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

Opinion: Donald Trump's critics take risk for good reason,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) In October, 1954, a chronically ill US senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy, checked into New York's Hospital for Special Surgery for an operation to treat recurring back pain. When he developed an infection after surgery, his prognosis was so poor that a priest was called to give last rites .

During his slow recovery, Kennedy worked on a book project — with his gifted aide Ted Sorensen playing the central role — that became ""Profiles in Courage."" It was six years before Kennedy would be elected president, nine years before he would be assassinated in a motorcade in Dallas. The book, which told the stories of senators who had risked their careers for standing by their principles, became a best seller and won the Pulitzer Prize for biography.

If Americans understood, the book suggested, ""the terrible pressures which discourage"" a politician from taking an unpopular stance — the possible ""loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow men"" -- they might be ""more appreciative of those still able to follow the path of courage.""

Those pressures are intense. As former Rep., a Republican who's spoken out against President Donald Trump wrote, ""'Profiles in Courage' is a thin book for a reason ."" But on Wednesday, at risk of political and personal harm, some Republicans, including one of their leaders, Rep. Liz Cheney, joined with Democrats in impeaching Trump for summoning a siege of the Capitol to stop the counting of Joe Biden's electoral votes on January 6.

""While many House Republicans reportedly supported impeachment,"" Dent observed in a second piece, ""only 10 courageous GOP members actually voted for it. If the Senate were to convict Trump and prohibit him from ever seeking high office again, many House Republicans would be most grateful and relieved. It's called 'hope yes, vote no.'

It was the second impeachment for Trump — unprecedented in US history. The first time, no House Republican voted ""aye,"" and in the Senate, only one Republican, Mitt Romney, voted to remove him from office.

Ken Keen, a former military deputy commander of US Southern Command, served 38 years in the US Army. ""We ask our military and our young men and women in uniform to put their lives on the line every day in defense of our country,"" he wrote. ""If political leaders are not ready to do the same and put their careers at risk by taking a stand against those whose actions may have provoked or encouraged the attack on our Capitol, resulting in the death of five Americans, Lt. Gen., a former military deputy commander of US Southern Command, served 38 years in the US Army. ""We ask our military and our young men and women in uniform to put their lives on the line every day in defense of our country,"" he wrote. ""If political leaders are not ready to do the same and put their careers at risk by taking a stand against those whose actions may have provoked or encouraged the attack on our Capitol, resulting in the death of five Americans, they should resign . They are in the wrong role and do not deserve the honor and privilege to be our leaders.""

When rioters stormed the Capitol, Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat from Illinois, felt the danger. ""My goal was to survive,"" she wrote, ""I quickly realized I was too tall to hide under the seats. I learned in a hurry how to use a gas mask. We evacuated to the safest room we could find ...""

""What happened on January 6 was NOT a political act. It was a crime. Violent. Vicious. Premeditated. Lethal. Everyone who incited it and everyone who committed it are perpetrators. And calls for 'unity' cannot be simultaneous excuses for this violence. To achieve unity, we must also deliver accountability and justice. I am not a prosecutor and cannot try Donald Trump in a court of law. Impeachment is the only means I have available to stop him from inciting further acts of mayhem, bloodshed and insurrection.

A warning

Julian Zelizer said Trump's two impeachments will be remembered as a warning ""of the immense dangers that our republic has found itself in after the radicalization of the Republican Party resulted in a near total abandonment of norms and institutional restraints. When partisanship triumphed over the needs of governance and the health of our democratic institutions, Historiansaid Trump's two impeachments will be remembered as a warning ""of the immense dangers that our republic has found itself in after the radicalization of the Republican Party resulted in a near total abandonment of norms and institutional restraints. When partisanship triumphed over the needs of governance and the health of our democratic institutions, violence ensued .""

Frida Ghitis wrote, were mostly "" Republicans who voted against impeaching Trump,wrote, were mostly "" duplicitous opportunists who claimed at the last moment that the country needed unity after they had contributed to the rhetoric bringing the nation to the precipice of civil war.""

Arick Wierson and Bradley Honan observed that, "" andobserved that, "" for every Liz Cheney, there are more than a dozen elected GOP officials who are still committed to Trump . Despite the fact that Republicans lost control of the House, Senate and White House during Trump's term, all signs suggest he will continue to control the party as its de facto leader, weighing down the more traditional wing of the party from wresting back control.""

Asha Rangappa pointed out that ""the people who planned and participated in this atrocity will get a knock on their doors from the FBI soon enough. But the domestic terror threat is not limited to that one mob. The very fact that the FBI has issued a threat bulletin to all 50 states reveals that the depraved ideology based on the lie about the 'rigged' election spreads far and deep."" She argued, ""It is hard to understand how — particularly in light of the many threats of violence made openly by pro-Trump groups and individuals on social media — Former FBI agentpointed out that ""the people who planned and participated in this atrocity will get a knock on their doors from the FBI soon enough. But the domestic terror threat is not limited to that one mob.

She argued, ""It is hard to understand how — particularly in light of the many threats of violence made openly by pro-Trump groups and individuals on social media — the FBI and its law enforcement partners were not better prepared for what took place .""

A transfer of power

At noon Wednesday, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. is due to take the oath of office as 46th president of the United States in an inauguration that will look unlike any other, given the security threat and the Covid-19 pandemic. The 45th president, who for months refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, is breaking with tradition by not planning to attend Biden's swearing-in.

That's not really a surprise. Trump's approach to the presidency is the same as the M.O. he brought to the business world, David Axelrod noted: ""flagrantly defying rules and norms and undermining institutions.""

""From the moment he descended the Trump Tower escalator in June 2015 and entered national politics with a barrage of incendiary, racist tripe, Trump has routinely and scurrilously lied and sold his self-serving version of events and conspiracy theories. He has willfully and cynically divided and inflamed the country he was elected to lead to suit his own ends.""

Trump's father taught him that there are two kinds of people -- killers and losers, as Axelrod pointed out. ""The violent insurrection against the US Capitol and our democracy will be his epitaph. The threat of legal action and disbarment from public office in the future still looms. But the President already has suffered the most painful penalty of all: Fred Trump's boy will go home a loser.

Trump is one of only four presidents in the last century to be denied a second term by voters.

The Senate trial

To Democrats in the House, impeaching Trump was an easy call. The more complicated question is how to handle a trial in the Senate, since the Republican majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, hasn't indicated he favors holding it before the end of Trump's term. For the incoming president, the trial poses a dilemma since it threatens to slow both the confirmation of Biden's Cabinet and the aggressive initiatives he has outlined to fight Covid-19 and revive the economy.

Some Republicans contend that moving ahead with the trial would be divisive.

Garry Kasparov argued that it's a mistake to ""sacrifice justice for unity. Russians learned this in the hardest possible way after the fall of the Soviet Union.""

Covid-19: One year later

January 20 isn't only the date of the Inauguration. It's also the one-year anniversary of the first confirmed Covid-19 case in the US — that of a 35-year-old man who survived. ""Since that time, more than 23 million Americans (almost 7% of the population) have been diagnosed with the infection and at least 385,000 have died,"" Dr. Kent Sepkowitz wrote. ""In response, effective treatments, public health containment strategies and vaccines have been developed, but the pandemic continues to worsen, both in the US and in other parts of the world.""

The reality, Sepkowitz noted, is that some of the advice he and other doctors gave in the early months of the pandemic proved to be incorrect. ""The year has been extremely humbling. We infectious disease specialists have been wrong repeatedly — a predictable problem with a once-in-a-century event, but still."" At first, doctors minimized the risk and said mask-wearing wasn't necessary. US scientists stumbled in developing reliable tests to diagnose the disease. Now there's hope in the form of vaccines, although their rollout has been much slower than predicted. ""The Biden team surely is aware of what lies ahead,"" Sepkowitz observed. ""We can only hope that its decisions will rely on evidence, sound judgment and, most of all, the lonely humility of a doctor caring for a critically ill patient .""

Megan Ranney wrote that ""the vaccine does not have to be as scarce as it is. As people in the highest priority groups, including those age 65 and older and those with compromised immune systems, scrambled this week to find a way to get one of the vaccines, Dr.wrote that ""the vaccine does not have to be as scarce as it is. Miscommunication from health officials and an underprepared vaccine distribution system can hinder vaccine administration just as much as slow vaccine production. While some places are overwhelmed by demand, other clinics have thrown out unused doses when individuals did not show up for their injections.""

MLK Day

Martin Luther King Jr. Day this year is especially resonant in the aftermath of the Capitol riot, wrote historian Peniel E. Joseph, author of ""The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.""

""The roots of the White supremacist tree that has flourished in the age of Trump are deep, and King combated these forces in his own time with a moral force and power that turned him into a radical political agitator who broke with his former political ally, President Lyndon B. Johnson, on the issue of Vietnam and a revolutionary human rights leader who vowed to help end militarism, racism and materialism before it destroyed American society,"" Joseph wrote.

""King would surely shy away from using his holiday as an example of American exceptionalism — and would instead push us toward the hard work of building, for the first time in our nation's history, a racially inclusive democracy that will ensure that this latest attack on the sacred citadel of American democracy will be the last .""

George Orwell in 2021

""1984"" author George Orwell, who died in 1950, is one of those thinkers whose eternal curse is to have his acute observations of his own society dragged into contemporary debates to be used and misused.

As Laura Beers noted, when Sen. Josh Hawley's book contract was canceled because he continued to contest the election without providing solid evidence of fraud, Hawley groused, ""This could not be more Orwellian ... This is the Left looking to cancel everyone they don't approve of.""

When a BBC presenter said Trump had inspired ""insurrection,"" an adviser to the Trump campaign accused him of using ""Orwellian language to change what happened.""

Beers, a historian who is preparing to teach a course on Orwell, wrote that while he ""opposed censorship, he abhorred the corruption of language by political leaders"" trying to cloak ""dubious or amoral actions"" in the ""language of bureaucracy and legalese, or the emotional language of patriotism. One of Orwell's deepest laments was that, during his lifetime, 'political speech and writing' had become 'largely the defense of the indefensible.'""",2021-01-17 00:00:00
Opinion: Donald Trump's ultimate outrage,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

Would such an episode end democracy in the US? Or would it, by showing the consequences of an authoritarian leader, act as a kind of vaccine, prompting the nation's immune system to turn authoritarianism back for good? (The book became a series last year on HBO, which is owned by CNN's corporate parent WarnerMedia.)

""The Plot Against America"" was fiction. But there were echoes of it in the question facing the US after the spectacle this week of an American president whipping up a crowd of supporters and urging them to head to the Capitol to block the final certification of the incoming president's victory in a free and fair election. Rioters invaded the building. Five people, including a police officer, died. Members of Congress scrambled for cover.

Among those rushed away by Capitol Police was Rep. Seth Moulton, a US Marine veteran from Massachusetts.

""Violent assault on democracy"" was something he expected while serving in Iraq, he wrote. ""I never imagined it as a United States congressman in America.""

As police attempted to retake the building, Moulton lamented that, ""We're sheltering together not because of a foreign terrorist attack, but because of a domestic coup attempt spurred on by rhetoric like that from the President and his supporters.. .Make no mistake: They are enemies of America. This is no protest. This is anarchy. It's domestic terrorism. The people who are in the building right now are traitors to our nation.""

SE Cupp wrote, ""I will never forget this: Americans storming the United States Capitol in what can only be described as a coup attempt, a Trump supporter pictured standing at the Senate dais, and one jaw-dropping image of police pointing guns at the House front door from inside as a demonstrator appeared to be trying to breach the chamber."" Cupp added: ""I will never forget the utter sadness over our divided, fragile democracy that As the attack unfolded,wrote, ""I will never forget this: Americans storming the United States Capitol in what can only be described as a coup attempt, a Trump supporter pictured standing at the Senate dais, and one jaw-dropping image of police pointing guns at the House front door from inside as a demonstrator appeared to be trying to breach the chamber."" Cupp added: ""I will never forget the utter sadness over our divided, fragile democracy that one man has tried so desperately to cleave in half for his own corrupt, narcissistic and craven self-interest.""

Finally, the Capitol was cleared, and at 3:41 am Thursday, the electoral vote counting was completed. Joe Biden is due to take the oath of office as the 46th President on January 20.

So far, a majority in the country appears to be decisively rejecting what President Donald Trump did and calling out his enablers, many of whom started jumping off his sinking ship. Democrats are moving to impeach Trump for a second time, with the possibility of some Republican support.

Julian Zelizer, it makes sense for Congress to ""go on record stating that any president who incites an attack on another branch of government Even though Trump has only 10 days left in office, wroteit makes sense for Congress to ""go on record stating that any president who incites an attack on another branch of government should no longer have the privilege of holding office ."" The Senate could not only convict Trump but also disqualify him from holding office in the future.

American carnage

John Avlon noted. ""Our country is The president whose inaugural speech talked of ""American carnage"" turned out to be the one who produced it over his big lie -- that he was cheated out of a re-election victory,noted. ""Our country is far more divided and violent and deluded than before he entered office . His misrule has led to this moment, but it is not his responsibility alone. Trump's fear-fueled lies and extremism and conspiracy theories have been indulged for too long by partisans. His rhetoric has directly led to death threats against election officials who have done their job honestly and independently.""

Scott Jennings. Trump's ""lies and conspiracy theories"" about the election caused the insurrection. ""All Republicans The rioters are not patriots, not Republicans and not conservatives, but are domestic terrorists, wrote GOP commentator. Trump's ""lies and conspiracy theories"" about the election caused the insurrection. ""All Republicans have a duty to support the republic and the Constitution by condemning this terrorism, rallying around the peaceful transfer of power and our constitutional institutions, and demanding all of the actions within the power of the President of the United States to restore order to our Capitol.""

When Paul Begala worked in the Capitol, his office window looked out to the National Mall. ""Every night as the sun went down,"" Begala recalled, ""the glow would illuminate my workplace, and I would ponder the miracle that a guy from Missouri City, Texas, could work in the same building where Lincoln served, walk the halls once strode by a confident young war hero named Jack Kennedy, go to meetings in the room where Harry Truman learned that FDR had died and that he now bore the awful burden of presidency.

""None of that history stopped these thugs. None of the majesty mattered to this mob. They cared not a whit about Lincoln or Kennedy, nor about the Constitution or the country. Their flag was not the Stars and Stripes that have draped the caskets of so many actual American patriots. Rather, it was the banner of a cult of personality, the name that had been emblazoned on a fraudulent 'university' and failed casinos.""

Ruth Ben-Ghiat. ""Although Trump lost the election two months ago, for his followers, he was the winner who had unjustly been deprived of what was rightfully his. Add in the culture of armed insurgency and the anti-democratic, extremist beliefs many of these groups espouse, and the solution of 'direct action' -- namely, an armed takeover of the halls of power to save the leader -- becomes compelling... Trump, of course, was not in the building. Last week ripped the final shreds off the mask of Trump, exposing him as a classic authoritarian leader, wrote. ""Although Trump lost the election two months ago, for his followers, he was the winner who had unjustly been deprived of what was rightfully his.

Trump, of course, was not in the building. He set the fire, but was careful not to be in a position to get burned by it or control it.

What now?

Incoming President Joe Biden condemned the attack on the Capitol, offered reasssuring words to the nation, and continued filling out his Cabinet, but he won't become President for more than a week. In the meantime, Democrats in Congress are urging Vice President Mike Pence to remove Trump under the provisions of the 25th Amendment.

Frida Ghitis. ""At this moment when everything is at stake, Pence can not only save the country, but ""Every day he is in office there is a very real possibility that he will unleash his backers in new and harmful ways,"" wrote. ""At this moment when everything is at stake, Pence can not only save the country, but he can also start the process of repairing America's battered reputation .""

Joe Lockhart. ""Republican leaders also need to take responsibility and look within their own party to confront those who helped encourage this insurrection."" Law enforcement officials promised to take action against the rioters. Americans ""deserve to know that everyone who participated in this act of seditious terror will be investigated and prosecuted under the law ,"" wrote. ""Republican leaders also need to take responsibility and look within their own party to confront those who helped encourage this insurrection.""

Jill Filipovic. ""If they're looking for the chief instigator, they should walk over to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. If they're looking for the many who carried out the violence, looting, and ransacking, many of their faces are easily visible in photos and videos, and ""The FBI says it 'is seeking to identify individuals instigating violence in Washington, D.C.,'"" noted. ""If they're looking for the chief instigator, they should walk over to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. If they're looking for the many who carried out the violence, looting, and ransacking, many of their faces are easily visible in photos and videos, and many are bragging about their acts on social media .""

One key question will be whether Trump could be held legally responsible for the riot. ""These domestic terrorists attacked the great symbol of American democracy,"" wrote Peter Bergen, ""and they should be held accountable -- and so should their Inciter-in-Chief, President Donald J. Trump.""

""There are limits to the First Amendment. It is a crime to incite or solicit others to commit crimes if you have reason to believe they may actually carry out those crimes,"" wrote Bergen.

Elie Honig, wrote that ""there is a criminal case to be made against President Donald Trump for his role in the assault on the Capitol. It's not an easy case or an automatic win for prosecutors. But A former prosecutor, CNN legal analyst, wrote that ""there is a criminal case to be made against President Donald Trump for his role in the assault on the Capitol. It's not an easy case or an automatic win for prosecutors. But there is a legitimate case there for any prosecutor with the fortitude to bring it — and the ability to counter the defenses Trump's legal team may use to fight back.""

The attack

Roxanne Jones, ""I recalled the George Floyd protests in Lafayette Park near the White House in June, where heavily armed law enforcement set off explosives and fired gas on peacefully gathered citizens of all races -- some of them even on their knees with their hands up or lying flat on the ground. It was impossible to miss the racial implications of the attack by the overwhelmingly White crowd and the sharp contrast to the way law enforcement reacted to Black Lives Matter protests last year. ""As I watched the siege of the Capitol building,"" wrote, ""I recalled the George Floyd protests in Lafayette Park near the White House in June, where heavily armed law enforcement set off explosives and fired gas on peacefully gathered citizens of all races -- some of them even on their knees with their hands up or lying flat on the ground. Photo after photo of that day shows protesters being beaten, arrested and dispersed by police. "" By contrast, it was all too easy for the rioters to invade the Capitol this week.

Rhae Lynn Barnes and Keri Leigh Merritt pointed out that ""as rioters, incited by the President and with some carrying White supremacist imagery descended upon the Capitol, scaled its walls, planted pipe bombs, and dangled from its railings, the pictures and videos were simultaneously stunning and revolting: The bright reds of the Confederate and Nazi flags and matching MAGA hats simmered against a sea of Trump flags now sold on street corner popup shops that outnumbered American flags, a noose, a raised wooden cross reminiscent of Klan lynchings, and a sweater reading 'Camp Auschwitz.' The lineage between the slaveholding secessionists and the modern insurrectionists could not have been more clear: Both groups were willing to destroy the union and Historiansandpointed out that ""as rioters, incited by the President and with some carrying White supremacist imagery descended upon the Capitol, scaled its walls, planted pipe bombs, and dangled from its railings, the pictures and videos were simultaneously stunning and revolting: The bright reds of the Confederate and Nazi flags and matching MAGA hats simmered against a sea of Trump flags now sold on street corner popup shops that outnumbered American flags, a noose, a raised wooden cross reminiscent of Klan lynchings, and a sweater reading 'Camp Auschwitz.'

Nicole Hemmer, the riot evoked memories of the August, 2017 Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally, in which far-right extremists, including neo-Nazis confronted counter-protesters.

The parallels: ""the hesitance of law enforcement to engage White, right-wing protesters (and their delay in doing so), the turn in right-wing media to the bogeyman of antifa as the source of disorder , the President's efforts to excuse or embrace the violence of his supporters.""

After the Capitol was secured, a few Black custodians were seen in a video widely viewed on social media sweeping up the damage from the riot, noted Issac Bailey. It revealed, he wrote, ""An abiding dignity in the work the men are doing. An illustration of their importance to the health of this country, just the latest example of how Black Americans remained steadfast throughout our history come what may.

""It feels wrong that they had to pick up the pieces from a failed insurrection attempt that, had it been successful, would have disenfranchised millions of voters, particularly those in areas with heavy Black populations .""

The preparations

Through the eyes of a longtime law enforcement official, Cedric L. Alexander, the preparations for defending the Capitol seemed deeply flawed. ""The Capitol appeared to be weakly 'guarded' by Capitol Police, a force massively outnumbered by the gathering insurrectionist mob,"" Alexander noted. ""Guarding an important site requires defense in depth. At the Capitol, not even a thinly fortified perimeter had been established.""

Was it ""incompetence, gross negligence or both?,"" Alexander asked. ""The only real mystery here -- and it is a mystery with the most profound implications -- is why law enforcement left itself so unprepared for a dangerous event many people, up to and including the President of the United States, had not merely anticipated but had actually announced days and days in advance.""

Paul Callan observed, ""The inability of police forces of the most powerful nation in human history to adequately protect the Capitol building from an angry mob seems inconceivable. observed, ""The inability of police forces of the most powerful nation in human history to adequately protect the Capitol building from an angry mob seems inconceivable. Where were the Secret Service, the FBI, the National Guard, not to mention the nation's powerful armed forces?

The enablers

Doug Heye, a former senior GOP official who repudiated Trump early in 2016. ""Trump has incited violence and sown division since he declared his candidacy in 2015. Former White House chief of staff and Northern Ireland special envoy Mick Mulvaney was among the first of the Trump officials to resign over the President's actions. ""What took so long, when all of this was so predictable,"" asked, a former senior GOP official who repudiated Trump early in 2016. ""Trump has incited violence and sown division since he declared his candidacy in 2015. In the end, this is exactly what Mulvaney signed up for , whether he cares to admit it or not.""

Michael D'Antonio. ""As the mob careens around the Capitol and lawmakers huddle together in a secret and secure facility, it's obvious that the likes of McConnell and Pence are This week's events demonstrated even to longtime loyalists Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell how wrong they were to back Trump, wrote. ""As the mob careens around the Capitol and lawmakers huddle together in a secret and secure facility, it's obvious that the likes of McConnell and Pence are far too late with the little display of opposition they mustered on the darkest day that hallowed building has ever seen.""

Kara Alaimo. ""One reason that things got so out of hand in the first place is because After four years of enabling Trump's extremism on their platforms, Facebook, Twitter and others suspended his accounts, and then Twitter banned Trump permanently. They were also too late, wrote""One reason that things got so out of hand in the first place is because Twitter didn't shut Trump's account down sooner, "" she noted. ""The platform, of course, allowed Trump to bypass the traditional media, which would have fact checked him, and make claims that were patently false... And because no one was willing to shut him down (@jack, I'm looking at you), he only became more emboldened. Social networks should have held Trump to the same standards as other users from the start.""

George Will, in the Washington Post. Don't forget Trump's enablers in Congress, including Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, who led the baseless challenge to the counting of electoral votes Wednesday. ""The three repulsive architects of Wednesday's heartbreaking spectacle — mobs desecrating the Republic's noblest building and preventing the completion of a constitutional process — must be named and forevermore shunned,"" wrote, in the Washington Post. ""They are Donald Trump, and Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz.""

Georgia puts GOP in minority

A day before the Capitol insurrection, Democrats won stunning victories in the Georgia runoff elections, giving them control of the US Senate to go along with their hold on the House and the next presidency.

Jess McIntosh. The winning campaigns of Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock ""dealt a devastating blow to anti-democratic forces within our government by sending Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell back to the minority,"" wrote

Laura Coates. ""All of them."" Merrick Garland, who was denied even a hearing by McConnell when President Barack Obama nominated him for the US Supreme Court seat now filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch, was promptly picked by Biden to be his attorney general. ""I hope he swallows the pill of that memory every single day before he strides down the hallway of the Department of Justice, not because any attorney general must seek vengeance, but because he has a moral, legal and ethical responsibility to understand and prevent injustice when he seeks justice on behalf of the people of the United States,"" wrote. ""All of them.""

Van Jones, is ""not just that President Donald Trump has largely undermined and ruined the Republican Party. It is also that progressive grassroots leaders (led overwhelmingly by Black women) The lesson of the runoffs, wrote, is ""not just that President Donald Trump has largely undermined and ruined the Republican Party. It is also that progressive grassroots leaders (led overwhelmingly by Black women) have reimagined, recreated and rebuilt the state's Democratic Party coalition .""

Coronavirus fear and hope

The Capitol riot and Georgia runoffs overshadowed a horrific week of death and disease from the Covid-19 pandemic. On Thursday alone, more than 4,000 Americans died.

Haig Aintablian. "" In California's hospitals, the scenes were especially dire. ""Thanksgiving, Christmas and now New Year's celebrations that shouldn't have happened have now led to countless Covid infections that are claiming their victims and testing our endurance,"" wrote ER doctor. "" No doctor I know has ever seen a situation like this outside of a natural disaster, terrorist attack or war . Our hospitals have so many Covid patients fighting to survive that they have overwhelmed our ICUs and led to overflow units that were never designed for such patients.""

Infectious disease expert Dr. Kent Sepkowitz noted that, ""even the brutal fact that it has killed more than 1.8 million people globally, including 350,000 in the US, has failed to sway some. We continue to have inconsistent acceptance of basic public health measures, as if the recommendations were an assault on free choice, a capitulation to a bunch of whimpering scientists with their fake news graphs and charts.""

Vaccines are our best hope, he wrote. If more than half of the people are vaccinated, Sepkowitz observed, ""rather than a runaway pandemic, we would see occasional small and moderate-sized outbreaks here and there, similar to what we see with measles, whooping cough and other vaccine-preventable infections almost every year. It's terrible and tragic and unnecessary -- but it's not on the same scale as the current historic pandemic.""

(CNN) ""And now for something completely different,"" John Cleese routinely intoned between absurdist sketches on "" Monty Python's Flying Circus ."" He might have been wearing a tuxedo or a pink bikini, and on one occasion he said it while appearing to be roasting on a spit.

After the debacle of 2020 — a year that felt a little like being on that spit -- many people are yearning for a clean break, ""something completely different.""

It might be too much to ask. The year begins with two pieces of leftover business: the runoff elections in Georgia Tuesday that will determine which party controls the US Senate, and the session of Congress Wednesday at which the Electoral College's votes to elect Joe Biden will be counted. The first is genuinely suspenseful, the second purely a formality, though one some Republican lawmakers are threatening to use as a forum to air President Donald Trump's baseless claim that he was cheated of reelection by massive voter fraud.

The GOP objections have "" zero chance of succeeding ,"" wrote election law expert. But that doesn't mean they won't cause harm -- ""American democracy cannot survive the losing party refusing to accept defeat.""

Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert sued Vice President Mike Pence this week to empower him to throw out electoral votes against Trump when he presides over the congressional session. "" So ridiculous ,""wrote. ""If Gohmert were right -- if the vice president could, at his own whim, simply discard certain electoral votes while accepting others, then on January 6, 2017, Vice President Joe Biden could have decided to install President Hillary Clinton, rather than Donald Trump. And on January 6, 2001, Vice President Al Gore could have named himself the winner of the 2000 election...You can see the absurdity here."" A federal judge dismissed Gohmert's lawsuit Friday and a circuit court rejected Gohmert's appeal Saturday.

Michael D'Antonio pointed out: ""Pence's tenure as vice president has looked like In fact, Pence's only constitutional role is to preside over the counting of the votes cast December 14, when Biden received 306 electoral votes compared to Trump's 232, and to announce Trump's defeat. That makes it an excruciating position for the veep to be in, aspointed out: ""Pence's tenure as vice president has looked like a continuous show of servility . When he wasn't offering over-the-top praise to Trump and his policy choices, he stood at his side beaming, with the kind of adoring expression that recalled Nancy Reagan's appreciative look toward her husband, former President Ronald Reagan.""

Jill Filipovic, "" After the Electoral College voted, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell finally recognized Biden as the President-elect. ""Let's be clear,"" wrote, "" McConnell doesn't get applause for foot-dragging , for belatedly doing the normal thing. It's not even the right thing -- 'doing the right thing' implies some sort of moral courage.""

Even the Trump-friendly New York Post called on the President to abandon his futile effort to overturn the election results. ""If you insist on spending your final days in office threatening to burn it all down,"" wrote the Post's editorial board, ""that will be how you are remembered. Not as a revolutionary, but as the anarchist holding the match.""

Instead, the threat came from within after the election: ""We began to see wild and baseless claims of domestic origin, about hackers and malicious algorithms that flipped the vote in states across the country, singling out election equipment vendors for having ties to deceased foreign dictators. None of these claims matched up with the intelligence we had, based on reporting from election officials or how elections actually work in this country.""

Complicating Georgia

Trump's railing against the outcome of the election and his sour attitude to the Covid-19 relief stimulus bill his own administration negotiated is making things tougher for the two Republican senators in Georgia.

Joe Lockhart. ""But Trump has saved a special kind of Grinch-like behavior for the two Republican Senate candidates in Georgia who are headed for runoff elections in January and for Senator Mitch McConnell, whose fate as majority leader depends on the GOP winning at least one of those races.""

Here come the vaccines

The most promising sign for 2021 is the rollout of vaccines that look to be extremely effective against the virus that causes Covid-19. But the disease is still rampant and hospitals in parts of the country are running out of space.

Dr. Kent Sepkowitz noted that What's more, the number of Americans vaccinated as of Saturday is 4.2 million, far behind the 20 million goal that had been set for the end of December.noted that the slow-moving rollout is not surprising given the logistical challenge of mounting a national public health program and ""the clear lack of urgency from the White House.""

Thomas O'Connor worked as a team leader on an FBI evidence team for more than 20 years before he retired in 2019. He investigated the attack on the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, along with the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole and of the US embassy in Kenya in 1998. But one of the experiences he will never forget is investigating the killing of 17 Iraqis in Baghdad on September 16, 2007. President Donald Trump pardoned four Blackwater security guards who were serving time for what O'Connor established was an unprovoked shooting spree at a traffic circle in Baghdad.

Among the dead were a mother and son driving in a white KIA. She was a doctor and he was going to medical school. Another was a 9-year-old boy, hit in the head with a Blackwater round, who slumped into his father's arms.

""The families of those killed and wounded at Nisour Square will now watch those responsible for this tragedy go free , thanks to a pardon by the President of the United States,"" wrote O'Connor. ""This simply makes me sad and angry . ... There is no forensic evidence of anyone shooting at the Blackwater team. How do I know? The evidence told me that.""

Opinion: Donald Trump's long goodbye,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) Minutes after he took the oath of office as the 45th President of the United States at the US Capitol on January 20, 2017, Donald Trump expressed gratitude to the outgoing President and first lady.

""Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power,"" Trump said, ""and we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.""

But ever since Trump's defeat at the hands of Joe Biden last month, the President has been anything but magnificent. He has done all he can to prevent an ""orderly and peaceful"" transfer to the next administration. This week, he threw his support behind an unprecedented lawsuit brought by the state of Texas which asked the US Supreme Court to throw out the votes of millions of people in states that gave Biden his victory.

Seventeen other red states and more than 100 GOP members of Congress quickly backed what would have amounted to a judicial coup d'état designed to give Trump four more years in office. But on Friday evening, the Supreme Court dismissed the assault on democracy, saying Texas had no legal standing to challenge ""the manner in which another state conducts its elections.""

On Monday, electors will gather in all 50 states and it's certain a majority will formally cast their votes in favor of Biden, who is to be sworn in on January 20. American democracy is beating back Trump's effort to ""steal an election,"" wrote, as judges and election officials, both Republicans and Democrats, reject his ""voter fraud"" claims. ""But the damage he has inflicted on the country will not end with his presidency, and this won't be the last time we see a charismatic politician with dictatorial tendencies attack the US system of government .""

David Axelrod. "" What Trump is fomenting is ""crazy, authoritarian stuff,"" wrote. "" If it were occurring anywhere else, Americans would condemn it as an appalling attempt to undermine democracy . History will scorn the cowards who meekly complied with Trump's scheme to tarnish and overturn the election -- and honor the many who showed courage and fidelity to the rule of law during this time of trial.""

James Moore, a longtime writer on Texas politics, noted that Ken Paxton, the state attorney general who filed the outlandish election suit ""has been indicted on securities fraud and accused by top aides of bribery, abuse of office and other potentially criminal offenses -- charges that he has denied."" Paxton's plea to the Supreme Court "" , a longtime writer on Texas politics, noted that Ken Paxton, the state attorney general who filed the outlandish election suit ""has been indicted on securities fraud and accused by top aides of bribery, abuse of office and other potentially criminal offenses -- charges that he has denied."" Paxton's plea to the Supreme Court "" might just be currying favor with Trump in an attempt to get a pardon before Paxton is potentially tried and convicted. Even a bad lawyer like our attorney general is likely to know he has no real case.""

A losing cause

Susan Glasser in the New Yorker: ""While his allies have lost fifty-plus cases since the election, Losing in court isn't stopping Republicans from continuing to deny reality, wrotein the New Yorker: ""While his allies have lost fifty-plus cases since the election, Trump has convinced millions of Americans to believe that the election was rigged against him -- seventy-seven percent of Republicans now say mass fraud occurred, according to a new Quinnipiac poll out Thursday -- and enlisted virtually the entire national leadership of the Republican Party in his concerted attack on the legitimacy of the results.""

On December 5, Jocelyn Benson, the Michigan secretary of state, was hanging Christmas decorations with her family. Her four-year-old son was getting ready to watch ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" when armed protesters ""descended on my home ... screaming falsehoods and obscenities into a bullhorn."" They were backing Trump's fraud claims, she wrote, and disputing the Michigan election results, which gave Biden the state's electoral votes, with a popular vote margin of more than 154,000.

It was ""the latest in a string of attacks that are a direct outgrowth of the hateful rhetoric and threats of violence we've seen invade our public discourse here in Michigan, and throughout our country, for several months,"" Benson wrote. ""Since the polls closed on November 3, we've seen hardworking public officials and election administrators on both sides of the aisle subjected to incessant and baseless threats designed to stop us from doing our jobs .""

Covid-19 milestones

It was a week of milestones in the Covid-19 pandemic: On Tuesday, the UK began vaccinating its citizens. On Wednesday, the US reported more deaths from Covid-19 than any other day in the pandemic -- 3,124. And on Friday, the FDA gave its emergency authorization for use of a vaccine in the US. The cascade of events comes at a time when the US is politically vulnerable, caught between an outgoing administration whose prime attention is elsewhere and an incoming one that can't take action yet.

Merrill Brown. ""And we're doing so with a sense of helplessness as ""We're watching, like spectators, a health catastrophe of historic proportions that has already resulted in more than 280,000 deaths in the United States, economic calamity for millions and what is looking increasingly like a crippling of the nation's health infrastructure,"" wrote. ""And we're doing so with a sense of helplessness as a rudderless government and an indifferent President do little more than await the public distribution of a vaccine.

Ines Hassan, because ""an efficient but stringent approval process was used by Vaccine approval came first in the UK, wrote health researcher, because ""an efficient but stringent approval process was used by leveraging multidisciplinary teams, advanced planning, real-time data evaluation, independent reviews and strong leadership .""

The first person vaccinated in the UK was Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week. The second was William Shakespeare, aged 81. The good news was a bit overshadowed though, wrote Holly Thomas, by a controversy over an especially British food item.

""A Scotch egg is a hard-boiled egg, wrapped in miscellaneous gray sausage meat, rolled in weirdly orange breadcrumbs,"" Thomas wrote. ""Sometimes this concoction is tiny, sometimes almost threateningly large."" Britons going to the pub in tier two of the country's Covid-19 restrictions are only allowed to order alcoholic drinks if they are accompanied by a ""substantial meal."" And members of Boris Johnson's government had trouble agreeing on whether a Scotch egg qualified as a meal.

While that debate ""was ridiculous, it sidestepped a more important point. Thousands of pubs, bars, restaurants and other venues are still closed, and may never reopen. It's hard to overstate how important this is on a personal level, let alone how many people's livelihoods have been or will be destroyed .""

Gus Perna, a four-star general who is the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed. ""Time is our enemy. Thousands continue to die every day from this virus. In the US, an enormous logistical challenge looms.

""Time is our enemy. Thousands continue to die every day from this virus. We cannot wait for perfection. We have made incredible strides to be ready.

Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's personal lawyer, was discharged after four days in the hospital for Covid-19 treatment.

In a triple header of unhelpful health advice, he deprecated the use of masks to prevent spreading the disease, boasted of the extra special care celebrities receive and touted the ""cocktail"" of drugs he received as the ones that had been given to Trump when he fell ill, lamented infectious disease expert Kent Sepkowitz.

""Giuliani's latest nonsense will lead to many patients, those without comparable strings to pull, feeling like they didn't receive the best treatment-- the Rudy one, the real one, the one that makes you feel 100% better almost immediately."" The truth is that ""we simply don't know enough about how and why patients with Covid-19 improve,"" wrote Sepkowitz.

Coping with loss

John Bare and his wife Betsy both came down with Covid-19 in August. He lost his sense of taste and felt disoriented, with low-grade fever and severe exhaustion. She progressed from a mild case to a deadly one. Betsy suffered from cancer and asthma along with other underlying conditions.

He considers himself fortunate that there was a moment they could talk, when she was in the ICU, about to go on a ventilator with a poor prognosis for survival. ""We both said to each other what we wanted to say,"" Bare wrote. ""We were not rushed. The medical team would wait. I count this among the luckiest moments of my life. To have had this time together, for us each to say what we wanted to say, for us each to hear what the other said, was an incredible gift.""

Now, he wrote, "" the tears emerge when I recall how lucky Betsy and I were to write our own ending, more or less . I cry out of guilt when my fortunes turn positive. I cry because I don't know how to order dinner now that I've lost my dining companion.""

The end of a restaurant

It only took two days for a demolition crew to pull apart Tastebuds, an award-winning Cleveland restaurant that Bridget McGinty founded 19 years ago.

As the pandemic destroyed the restaurant's business model, McGinty said she waited in vain for help from her bank and the government. When she explained the situation to her parish priest, he suggested a last resort -- selling the business to the church. ""He explained that they had applied for grant money to renovate a hall and commercial kitchen to better serve the community,"" she wrote.

When McGinty and her co-owner talked to the couple running the church's food pantry, they left ""feeling humbled and inspired. We had been so powerless for so long and suddenly we were in a position to do something tremendous ... We were no longer considering what we could sell to the church, we were donating anything and everything we could .""

Biden's choices

Joe Biden nominated retired General Lloyd Austin as defense secretary. He would be the first Black person to hold that post, and his rise over a 40-year military career is an inspiring one. But the choice has drawn criticism -- over his reserved personal style, his leadership in the Iraq War and questions about whether the choice of a retired general, as with Trump's choice of Gen. James Mattis, weakens civilian control of the military.

Mark Hertling, wrote of Austin that ""no one has attempted to give him a colorful combat nickname such as 'Mad Dog' or even 'Chaos'. But in talking to those who know him -- like Biden and those who served beside Austin -- you'll likely hear about how Lloyd cares for people, no matter the size of the organization. You'll also hear about his pragmatic and succinct approach to solving complex problems, which comes from reasoned and serious reflection. Those who know him understand A West Point classmate, Lt. Gen., wrote of Austin that ""no one has attempted to give him a colorful combat nickname such as 'Mad Dog' or even 'Chaos'. But in talking to those who know him -- like Biden and those who served beside Austin -- you'll likely hear about how Lloyd cares for people, no matter the size of the organization. You'll also hear about his pragmatic and succinct approach to solving complex problems, which comes from reasoned and serious reflection. Those who know him understand he has the personal courage to speak truth to power and provide valuable insight to his President -- and to our allies and partners - because we have seen him do just that, in the toughest of situations.""

Peniel E. Joseph, noting that this week marks the 155th anniversary of the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, with a glaring loophole for those behind bars. ""This defect helped institutionalize the system of mass incarceration Racial justice is a vital issue for America in the age of Biden, wrote, noting that this week marks the 155th anniversary of the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, with a glaring loophole for those behind bars. ""This defect helped institutionalize the system of mass incarceration that 21st century freedom dreamers are now working so hard to dismantle ,"" Joseph observed.

Paul Begala, who served in the Clinton White House, wrote that some conservatives ""think people like Biden insist on diversity because of some politically correct White liberal guilt ... (but) the commitment to diversity is far more practical, besides being fundamentally just. Biden has promised to pick the most diverse cabinet ever, a step beyond what Bill Clinton promised: ""a cabinet that looks like America."", who served in the Clinton White House, wrote that some conservatives ""think people like Biden insist on diversity because of some politically correct White liberal guilt ...

Air Force test pilot Chuck Yeager was immortalized in Tom Wolfe's book ""The Right Stuff"" and the movie, in which he was played by Sam Shepard.

Yeager, who died this week at 97, was not only a celebrated World War II fighter pilot but ""the first person to break the sound barrier, going 700 miles an hour, which he did with a busted rib after a fall from a horse"" in 1947, as John Avlon noted.

""Yeager was a direct connection to an American ethos that we've lost sight of -- one before the narcissistic need for attention, the shallow materialism full of phony tough bluster and the fetishization of victimhood took hold and began to define our country, from the Oval Office on down.""

Surreal world of sports in 2020

The 2020 Olympics: postponed. Wimbledon, March Madness and the Boston Marathon? As Amy Bass pointed out, they were canceled. And the rest of the sports calendar was scrambled by the pandemic:

""Horse racing's Triple Crown started with its third leg, the Belmont Stakes, and finished with the second, the Preakness; the French Open, traditionally a harbinger of summer, took place after the US Open, which held its traditional Labor Day weekend spot, albeit without spectators. The Indy 500, a Memorial Day staple, took place at the end of August, alongside a delayed Tour de France.""

Many of the most memorable moments of the year, Bass wrote, came when the world outside sports was allowed to forcefully intrude into the games. Naomi Osaka, who won the US Open, wore ""to each match a mask emblazoned with the name of a Black victim of violence -- seven names chosen from a tragic number of possibilities."" It showed ""how individual stances can morph into significant acts of solidarity, reinforcing, perhaps more powerfully than ever before, why we need to listen to athletes for a change.""

What will sports look like in 2021?",2020-12-13 00:00:00
Opinion: The people who saved America's democracy,"(CNN) Wednesday was certainly a day of celebration. After a month of turbulence, danger, and political instability, President Joe Biden was sworn into office. The transition of power happened. A new commander in chief, who is committed to the health of our democratic institutions, started his term.

Many commentators breathed a sigh of relief. One of the most common refrains of the historic day was: ""the system worked."" In his inaugural address, Biden himself proclaimed: ""democracy has prevailed.""

Of course, this is true. Donald Trump has left the White House. The violence that rocked Capitol Hill on January 6 was not repeated.

But just because the constitutional system worked doesn't mean it was inevitable that this would happen. It didn't work so much as it survived. Indeed, what was extraordinary about the past few weeks was just how frail our constitutional system can be in an era of intense polarization and when one party has been radicalized. When a President and his party are willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve and retain power, it's possible that the system we cherish won't function. Had Republicans controlled the House of Representatives or had the election been closer, it isn't hard to imagine how the effort to overturn the results might have been successful.

Under tremendous stress, the system depended on individuals and organizations who took steps to rein in the chaos. There were of course the millions of voters and activists who mobilized over the years to make certain that Democrats and independents leaning their way turned out and enjoyed a sizable popular vote victory in 2020.

Everyone understood that if the results looked like 2000, chaos would erupt. Were it not for the hard work of activists like Stacey Abrams and the New Georgia Project , for instance, Georgia wouldn't necessarily have turned blue. There were thousands of suburban women who have been doing the hard work of registering and canvassing at the local level since 2016 to make certain that a reckless commander in chief did not win reelection. Organizations such as Indivisible worked tirelessly throughout the election. With the pandemic threatening the ability of Americans to vote in person, it took a huge push by all of these groups and other volunteers to work the phone banks, send the texts and go online to make sure that everyone understood how to send in their vote.

The system also wouldn't have worked had it not been for the judges ruling on challenges to voting in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania who rebuffed the administration's campaign to discredit legitimate votes based on false claims of voter fraud. The judges spanned those appointed by Democratic presidents to others appointed by Trump himself, none of whom were willing to move forward with his claims. Had any of them done so, the dominos could have fallen very quickly in a different direction.

""Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy,"" wrote Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee, in the unanimous decision of the US Circuit Court of Appeals. ""Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here."" Two other judges -- appointed by President George W. Bush -- signed onto the decision.

There were election officials throughout the swing states who refused to be intimidated by the President. There was nothing inevitable about their doing so. Many faced serious threats from the pro-Trump mob for their refusal to overturn the election. ""It has to stop,"" Georgia Republican election official Gabriel Sterling said of the threats during a news conference in early December. ""Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language ... This is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It's too much.""

We needed the talented reporters who worked within a chaotic media landscape to keep a clear eye on what was happening in the post-election period. There were numerous stories over the past month that kept hammering away at the falsehoods behind the President's claims, pushing back against allegations of massive fraud and showing through reality-based analysis what was real. More reporters and headline writers were willing to talk directly about what the Republicans were doing in honest terms, calling out lies for what they are.

Members of Congress deserve credit for stepping back into the chambers to finish the certification process after having their lives threatened on January 6. Although some Republicans continued with their groundless election fraud rhetoric, many returned trembling to make sure that the mob did not win.

The system also depended on leaders in the armed forces who publicly made clear that they served the country, not the President, and to everyone who made sure that Wednesday's events ran smoothly. Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman, who escorted Vice President Harris at the inauguration, heroically moved the rioters from where US senators were hiding during the electoral vote certification process. Had the rallies and violence that took place on January 6 happened on Inauguration Day, the situation could have been perilous. But after the massive failures of the insurrection, this time all the authorities involved made sure that the events in Washington could proceed smoothly.

These are perilous times, and we shouldn't try to move forward in order to magically heal. The problems exposed in our system are real. We can't always depend on people doing the right thing. That means we need our new leaders to spend time investigating what happened to make sure that stronger checks and balances are put into place to prevent any unhinged presidents from doing what Donald Trump did in future lame-duck periods. Otherwise, the outcome might be very different the next time around.

The praise or condemnation President Donald Trump is drawing for the latest US actions in the Middle East in no way diminishes the power of the legal bombshell that just exploded in the United States with new evidence of his behavior regarding Ukraine.

Newly revealed documents paint an incriminating picture, showing administration officials anxiously struggling to follow orders from Trump himself despite concerns that the order could go against the national security interests of the United States and warnings from the Pentagon that it could be illegal.

We are telling them they should be able to smile through the pain.

The level of crisis the country faces under this pandemic is new, and Trump's performance has been abysmal — and familiar. For example, tests are not widely available in part because the administration declined to use a World Health Organization testing regime, choosing instead to develop its own, which has not worked as well as expected, according to an investigation from ProPublica. This fateful decision, which squandered precious time, helps explain why other countries have been better at tracking the virus, and tracking is essential to limiting outbreaks.

Cedric Alexander: Video of George Floyd feels like a monstrous rerun

May 28

Six years ago, in 2014, another black man, Eric Garner, pleaded with police officers in New York City who held him in a chokehold, saying ""I can't breathe."" His alleged crime? Selling ""loosies"" -- individual cigarettes -- to passersby.

What happened in 2014 and 2020 do share a common root. It is a catastrophic failure of training and an unconscionable failure of culture. Both are derelictions of leadership. Daniel Pantaleo, the then-NYPD officer accused of fatally choking Garner, was fired after a disciplinary trial. He is suing New York City over his termination.

Garner's words -- echoed so wrenchingly by Floyd -- became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.

There will be no young gay or transgender person getting on a plane from their Midwestern town where they aren't out to come to New York, the place where they can be fully themselves for the first time. There will be no adrenaline rush from the sound of one million people who have your back. There will be no Larry Kramer, the activist icon who co-founded Gay Men's Health Crisis and ACT UP and who just passed away. There will be no glitter.

Today, black and brown people are inspiring the world with their strength, determination, and willingness to see the struggle through to total victory.

I believe that this global uprising will never stop, and it will move into every heart, home and community on Earth, until the day when all people are treated with the dignity, respect and love that God intends for us. I believe that on that day, white supremacy will finally be buried forever.

Yaffa Fredrick and the voices of 'Generation Resilient': A generation hit by three soul-crushing crises

Yaffa Fredrick

June 25

In a moment when the country is reckoning with ways to dismantle institutionalized racism, debt relief could be an ideal place to take concrete action.

The pandemic poses a risk not just for recent graduates, but for the many students who must return to school this fall. And since Covid-19 will likely be an issue come September, teachers must consider how they design lesson plans for their students -- taking into account the challenges of the spring semester.

As society becomes increasingly aware of the devastating impact of police brutality, these signatories have chosen to shift attention to an imaginary political correctness police.

Ray Halbritter: The terrible R-word that football needed to lose

Ray Halbritter

July 13

The NFL and the team finally made the right call, for which they should be commended. Make no mistake, today is a win for the NFL. While long overdue, this is ultimately a good decision for the Washington team, the NFL, our country -- and not just Native peoples -- since it closes a painful chapter of denigration and disrespect toward people of color.

Future generations of Native youth will no longer be subjected to this offensive and harmful slur every Sunday during football season.

Mr. Lewis had a way of putting you at ease and making you feel like nothing was more important at that moment than sitting and talking with you. And that is just what we did.

There was no question too small or obvious for him to answer. He gave me more time than anyone of his stature would have been expected to allow and I savored every story, every parable and every lesson he shared.

Michelle Obama and Melinda Gates: We can't leave adolescent girls behind in Covid-19 response

Michelle Obama

Melinda Gates

August 7

Even before Covid-19 struck, more than 98 million adolescent girls worldwide were not in school, according to UNESCO. Now, due to ripple effects from the pandemic, the Malala Fund predicts an additional 20 million girls of secondary school age could remain out of school -- not just this year, but possibly forever.

It's not only girls' education that's at risk. It's their safety and security, too. During a crisis like this one, adolescent girls face a heightened threat of physical and sexual violence, early and forced marriage, and unintended pregnancy on top of sustained economic hardship.

Dean Obeidallah: Joe Biden just destroyed one of Trump's biggest attack lines

Dean Obeidallah

August 9

Almost on cue Saturday afternoon, around the same time Biden was on his bicycle, Trump tweeted out from the posh confines of his country club one of his go-to attack lines against the former VP, calling him ""Sleepy Joe Biden.""

The irony was delicious. There's Biden briskly riding a bicycle while Trump is at his private country club, where the only exercise he seems to get is getting in and out of his golf cart. Yet Trump is calling Biden ""Sleepy."" Sometimes comedy writes itself. But in this case Twitter helped as the hashtag ""Trump Can't ride a Bike"" got traction online, with one anti-Trumper juxtaposing video footage of Biden riding his bicycle with Trump struggling to walk down a ramp after delivering the commencement address in June at West Point.

As in 2020, the year 1918 was shaped both by global pandemic and protest. As Americans today process a momentous anniversary -- the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment recognizing women's right to vote -- against the current backdrop of Covid-19's devastating effects, the story of the suffragist doctors is a timely reminder of the honor and respect still due to too many forgotten American women.

Nancy Altman: Social Security could come to a screeching halt

September 1

Trump has shown himself willing to attack numerous fundamental institutions. He has attacked the US Postal Service, which the Constitution explicitly lists as an enumerated power of Congress. He has attacked the free press and our elections. Does anyone believe he wouldn't take our Social Security system hostage to attain a radical reform?

Adding insult to injury, it is easy to imagine that Donald Trump will host a Rose Garden signing ceremony for legislation ending Social Security as we know it.

September 10

Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany faced her moment of reckoning in the briefing room on Wednesday, when reporters confronted her about the recordings, released by veteran journalist Bob Woodward, in which President Trump acknowledged in early February that the coronavirus was airborne and deadlier than the flu, even as he publicly dismissed concerns about the virus and called it the Democrats' ""new hoax."" In March, Trump told Woodward that he intentionally downplayed the dangers of the virus, saying, ""I always wanted to play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic."" McEnany failed on an epic scale in her response.

Peniel Joseph: NFL's racial justice efforts fall far short

Peniel Joseph

September 11

This year's Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the shooting of Jacob Blake have hastened a long overdue national reckoning on Black citizenship and dignity.

For the NFL, this meant ending the willful ignorance that allowed commissioner Roger Goodell to stand by while powerful owners like Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys conflated peaceful protest against the killing of African Americans by law enforcement with disrespecting the American flag (he has recently adjusted his stance somewhat). This latest awakening looks performative at best, and the motions the league is going through are simply not enough.

September 16

On the issues, Trump probably had his best political moment when talking about bringing the troops home from the Middle East. And he definitively denied the anonymously sourced story in The Atlantic that claimed he said awful things about American soldiers wounded or killed in battle. He also had a nice retort that will appeal to his kind of voters when he said: ""It's a big battlefield and I have a lot of forces against me. Sometimes you don't have time to be totally, as you would say presidential -- you have to get things done."" This message will drive the elites crazy and thrill those who hate the elites immensely.

It is appalling that less than 4% of the justices serving on our Supreme Court have been women and that women still do not comprise an equal number of judges sitting on lower federal courts.

When President Barack Obama greeted RBG at Justice Elena Kagan's swearing-in, he asked her: ""Are you happy that I brought you two women?"" Ginsburg replied, ""Yes, but I'll be happier when you bring me five more."" We will be happier too, seeing more women selected for the Supreme Court and positions of power across all professions.

Robert Redford: The big question I want answered

Robert Redford

October 11

Maybe it's too much to suggest, at the peak of a presidential campaign, that we have a serious discussion about burning rainforests or understaffed long-term care facilities. Complex problems don't make great campaign issues. They don't rally your base; they don't get people to the polls (or the post office). But these are not subjects that are going to patiently wait their turn, that are going to hang back in line until we're ready to talk about them.

For all these reasons, it's my hope that this November will provide a hard reset -- of our national direction, most of all, but also our national attention.

Garry Kasparov: Win or lose, with Trump, prepare for the unimaginable

Garry Kasparov

October 31

Autocrats are aware of the consequences they might face for the damage they do, but they believe they can avoid those consequences by staying in power, forever if necessary. Trump might have been indicted several times over were he not protected by his office, and a sense of impunity tends to make one sloppy.

Trump no doubt believes that he has more to lose by leaving office than by fighting -- lawlessly or not -- to stay. The oligarchs and thugs he so admires surely agree. They won't easily let go of such a lucrative investment -- one of their own kind in the Oval Office.

David Gergen: The single most important quality a president must have

David Gergen

November 2

A president cannot get big things done here at home unless he can marshal the support of a sizable majority of the people. Sure, recent presidents have exercised power more frequently through executive orders, but those aren't lasting in their impact: The next president can easily reverse them, as Trump has demonstrated. Nor can a president easily persuade other advanced nations to embrace controversial policies unless they believe he is a reliable friend.

Indeed, I believe that the restoration of trust should be the single highest priority of our next president. Everything else will flow from there.

Kate Brower

November 7

Joe Biden will face the vexing and -- given Trump's uniquely compromised stature -- unprecedented decision of whether to allow his predecessor to receive intelligence updates, which has long been standard operating procedure. Trump's unusually close relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, even as the intelligence community says that Russia continues to interfere in our elections, makes continued access a potential cause for concern.

Traditionally, presidents allow their predecessors to be briefed because former presidents often meet with foreign leaders. That access can be limited or cut off entirely. It is totally the sitting president's prerogative.

Nicole Hemmer: What the Greatest Generation had that the Covid generation lacks

November 18

Holidays sharpened the sense of deprivation and the desire to stop sacrificing, at least for a day. Early signs that Thanksgiving would be particularly contested emerged during the Depression in 1939, when President Franklin Roosevelt, hoping to give the economy a much-needed boost, moved Thanksgiving up a week to extend the Christmas shopping season. Americans revolted. Republicans derided the change as ""Franksgiving"" and only half the states acknowledged the new date, rejecting what they saw as government intrusion on a sacrosanct tradition.

Little did they suspect that within a few years, the war would dramatically remake Thanksgiving, making traditions both more desirable and more difficult to sustain.

Jill Filipovic: At Thanksgiving, an America of obscene contrasts

Jill Filipovic

November 24

This year, many American families will find gratitude harder to summon heading into the holidays. Unemployment, widespread hunger and unchecked sickness and death are weighing heavily.

The President doesn't seem too worried -- and neither does Wall Street. The Dow went above 30,000 on Tuesday, and then Trump popped out before the cameras to crow about the market's success. It was brief -- just one minute -- but obscene. There is perhaps no greater example of the distortions wrought by the President's reliance on the markets as indicators for American financial well-being than this: A record-high Dow, while record numbers of Americans are hungry.

Elizabeth Leiba: The story I had to share after Kyle Rittenhouse posted $2 million bail

Elizabeth Leiba

November 29

Sitting in the back seat of a police car, the strangest thoughts went through my head: Handcuffs are heavier than they look on TV. If someone isn't deemed a threat, their hands are cuffed in the front. There are no door handles on the inside of the back seat of a police car and the windows are tinted so you can see out, but no one can see your shame as you sit inside.

I stared down at my cuffed wrists, hands in my lap, as the officers stood outside filling out the arrest report and chatting casually. They laughed at some inside joke. I was numb. This seemed like a dream.

I'm in sales for the hotel industry ... or at least I was. On Sunday, March 8, I was heading to California from Minnesota, where, because of the freezing weather, I was in need of a dose of warmth and vitamin D. Little did I know then that a blissful Sunday brunch in Santa Monica would be my last dose of travel for the rest of 2020.

By Tuesday, Coachella had postponed its festival. By Wednesday, the NBA announced that it was suspending its season and the MLB announced that spring training and the beginning of the season were suspended. My specialty in hotel sales was in sports and entertainment. A triple threat of industries pulling the emergency brake.

It's important to remember that electors are human beings who are chosen at state party conventions or by state party committees, often as a reward for their work on behalf of the party (the Constitution states that ""no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States"" should be appointed). Electors are expected to be loyal to the party's ticket, and while there is no federal law requiring them to follow the will of the people in their state, 33 states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring pledges from their electors and 14 states provide a means to replace an elector who attempts to vote contrary to expectations

When I would stop at a country store near Davidson on the pretense of buying organic eggs and artisan cheese, Betsy would put in her order and wait. The first things in my basket were ginger cookies and fried pies. Betsy would unwrap a fried pie and eat it on the drive home.

A big part of me died with her.

Millions of families around the world are suffering from the same, sudden loss. I am part of this tribe, a new global community of survivors trying to find order in chaos, grinding through the emptiness this virus has created. With every sunrise, we count the minutes ticking off through the day, wondering if we can hold it together through Zoom meetings at work and well-intended queries about how we are doing.

Caught in darkness, I have turned to pie to light my journey. I'm not eating pie. At least no more than usual. I use pie the way a student of meditation uses a mantra. To practice mindfulness. To soften sharp edges of the day. I carve pie slices from clay. I paint images of pies in acrylic. I photograph pie. I work on song lyrics about pie. I imagine writing murder mysteries where the plot turns on pie. I question the particulars of pie, wondering about the forces that shaped pie over the past thousand years. If pie could talk!

Pie makes people smile. Betsy's favorite was German chocolate pie from the local K&W Cafeteria. She'd frequently request a slice, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I would bring home a whole pie. Who buys one slice of pie? Coconut pie and chocolate icebox pie were back-ups.

Betsy found joy in food. In her last year, as pain increased from chronic diseases, she requested cake and ice cream each day. When store-bought cake would not do, we retrieved a chocolate pound cake from the local bakery. On special occasions, she'd order a hummingbird cake or Lady Baltimore cake.

Betsy loved biscuits, too. With illness limiting our travel options, we aspired to annual holiday retreats to Chapel Hill, NC --- a two-hour car ride away. Her favorite breakfast there was a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit and cinnamon roll from Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen. She would nibble at both, not finishing either.

Betsy in 2001 celebrating the third birthday of her niece in Concord, NC, with ice cream and cupcakes.

Early on with Betsy, I learned not to reserve joy for special occasions. Turns out deprivation does not lead to salvation. It just leads to a hankering for pie.

Betsy and I tested positive for the coronavirus at the same time in August. Our best guess is she contracted it at a local medical center -- while waiting in a line for a Covid-19 test a pulmonologist required for her annual exam. Between tests administered during hospitalizations and doctor visits, Betsy had cleared four or five Covid-19 tests before the positive result.

For me, the illness was nasty. Loss of taste, cognitive disorientation, low-grade fevers and a level of exhaustion I did not know was achievable.

For Betsy, who suffered from what we call ""underlying conditions,"" the diagnosis arrived at the same time as a blood infection. For the first week, doctors described her coronavirus case as mild. By day eight, they described it as deadly. The virus grabbed her lungs and never let go.

The terms ""underlying conditions"" and ""chronic disease,"" brought into public conversation by the pandemic, mask details we avoid. When we say our loved one is suffering from cancer, asthma, diabetes and kidney disease -- which were all on Betsy's list -- it makes people wince. So, we hold our tongues and nod as acquaintances suggest certain fixes -- from yoga to Pilates to forest bathing . Spousal caregivers become expert at helping partners suffering from chronic disease create an illusion that all is well. Now the ferocity of Covid-19 is tearing down this façade.

A spouse waiting in the car is one of the tells of chronic disease. When I would stop at a country store near Davidson on the pretense of buying organic eggs and artisan cheese, Betsy would put in her order and wait. The first things in my basket were ginger cookies and fried pies. Betsy would unwrap a fried pie and eat it on the drive home.

Now, I cry in the car. And I cry in the grocery store, at work, on the phone, in my doctor's office. I have cried writing, painting, sculpting, sending emails and pruning shrubs. I have cried in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Massachusetts and Montana. I am aggregating votes in the Electoral College of Crying.

Betsy in the 1990s during a trip to the Blue Ridge Mountains in Boone, NC.

The crying is more complicated than anyone knows. Grief is a source, surely. More often, the tears emerge when I recall how lucky Betsy and I were to write our own ending, more or less. I cry out of guilt when my fortunes turn positive. I cry because I don't know how to order dinner now that I've lost my dining companion.

I cry because I understand Roger Angell's commentary on aging, published in The New Yorker in 2014 when he was in his early 90s: ""Everyone in the world wants to be with someone else tonight, together in the dark, with the sweet warmth of a hip or a foot or a bare expanse of shoulder within reach. Those of us who have lost that, whatever our age, never lose the longing: just look at our faces.""

I have not cried at the hospital because I was not allowed to see Betsy there. Managing Betsy's hospitalization by phone, one thing I learned is you never want to pick up a call and hear from palliative care. It signals the patient has slipped into a situation where life-or-death decisions are approaching.

A slice of sour cherry pie that John created with air-dry clay and acrylic paint.

Betsy's nurses, who delivered updates by phone, were as encouraging as the angels. Their kindness props up hope, even when conditions are not so great. After a few days, the hospitalist described her illness as ""mild."" Yet ""mild"" was still miserable for Betsy. The breathing supports hurt her face. Sleep was hard to come by. Her back pain flared. Out of caution, and worried about the need for emergency intubation, the hospital required a liquid diet. Betsy craved her own pizza creation -- thin crust, white sauce, pineapple and mushroom. She craved a Mr. Goodbar.

The hospitalist was so optimistic that he sent Betsy home to recover. I was still under quarantine and recovering from Covid-19 myself, so we were frightened by the burden of my having take on the role filled by the medical professionals who had been caring for Betsy around the clock.

When health workers lifted Betsy into the hospital bed we had rented for home use, we realized the doctor had not made provisions to supply the Covid patient's essential need: home oxygen. A nurse from the hospital called to check on Betsy, part of the ""virtual"" care the hospital provided to Covid-19 patients recovering at home. The nurse shrieked when I reported her oxygen level. ""She needs to be in the hospital,"" the nurse said.

Egg custard pie by John.

In all, Betsy's home stay lasted about one hour. The emergency medics arrived not long after the call from the virtual-care nurse. They loaded Betsy back into an apparatus to move her down a flight of stairs and into the ambulance. That was the last time I ever saw her.

Turns out returning to the hospital is not like checking back into a hotel, even when the hospital recalls the patient. The patient starts over in the ER. Brand new to a system already bloated with broken bodies. Betsy was left alone another night. No company, no solid food. In case an emergency surgery was required, as she described the experience to me later, she had to have an empty stomach.

She was one of many bodies parked on one of many beds alongside the acute-care workstream somewhere in the warren of bays and hallways. When I called the next morning expecting to hear that the hospital had resolved the home-oxygen glitch, I was told she was in critical condition. Just like that. From our master bedroom to ICU, with conditions unfavorable.

A few days later the palliative care lady called. Her candor was brutal. Betsy was trying to breathe. The docs were providing support, short of the ventilator. The support, I was told by the palliative care lady, was not working. The family had to make a decision.

Imagine every breath as a new project. Each breath a heavy lift, requiring specific intent and effort. For days and days, Betsy worked to suck in air and to push out air. Every breath took more from her than it gave. For Betsy and millions of Covid-19 patients, breathing is no longer an involuntary act. Over and over again, lying motionless in that hospital bed without a friend in sight, all of life's comforts stripped away. Stuck in whatever position the nurses have arranged their bodies, they focus all of their mental and physical energy on one thing: Breathing.

""I'm trying,"" Betsy would tell me in our calls. ""I'm trying really hard.""

Only a couple of us close to Betsy know that, pre-Covid, on bad asthma days she struggled to pull enough air to read aloud to her granddaughters. How could I tell her that she was failing, that her full-out effort to breathe was not good enough, even with the contraptions that helped push and pull oxygen?

Betsy had made it clear to doctors and family that she did not want to be moved to the ventilator. In the end, she decided to try the ventilator, on limited terms, to see if an experimental treatment of antibodies would reverse her fortunes.

In my private call with the palliative care lady, I asked about what would happen if Betsy tried the ventilator. If the ventilator failed, I wanted to know, would Betsy wake up for a final conversation before passing?

No, I was told. If the ventilator failed, Betsy would pass without regaining consciousness.

It was a Monday, just after lunch, when I was able to connect to Betsy by phone. Just Betsy and me. No docs or family members. Soon a nurse came in and said the medical team was ready to move Betsy to the ventilator. We knew that was coming but didn't know when. Now the cold hard truth from the palliative care lady was no longer hanging out there in the future.

We, of course, spoke of the chance of a miraculous recovery, of the excitement over the experimental antibodies treatment. We also acknowledged that, absent the miracle, this would be the last time we would ever speak to each another.

You can watch this play out in the movies. You can imagine what you might say. In truth, there is no way to simulate the intensity. We both said to each other what we wanted to say. We were not rushed. The medical team would wait.

I count this among the luckiest moments of my life. To have had this time together, for us each to say what we wanted to say, for us each to hear what the other said, was an incredible gift. Then there was nothing else to say. It was time. As we started to cut the phone connection, I could hear the medical team moving medical machines, readying Betsy for the intubation.

The palliative care lady was right. Betsy never woke up. Her condition never reversed. Covid-19 took her.

During the night and early mornings, in the state between asleep and awake, Betsy and I still talk. In our bed, I reach over and rub her arm. I wake up stroking a pillow. I am grateful for these encounters. They are sweet. Never bitter. On the shelves by her side of the bed, I have placed my first ceramics works, the clay carved and painted in the form of a slice of sour cherry pie. There is a secret compartment inside. Betsy liked secret compartments. I am grateful Betsy still visits me. I know that will pass one day, and it makes me sad to imagine it so. I have Betsy's voice preserved on a couple of phone messages, asking me to call her at the hospital. That wasn't intentional. Just that death comes on so fast. Only after the graveside service do you examine answering machines.

With grief sweeping over me in waves that come without notice, my psychologist says I should seek out things that bring comfort. My first response: Not feeling like this would bring comfort! But I have to trust the journey. There is no switch to flip. All of this is self-indulgent, and that nags at me.

People lose loved ones every day. Death is the only guarantee. Tragedy is thick in the air. Refugees, migrant children separated from their parents , the uninsured sick who cannot get care. Who am I to ask for grace? I am blessed in so many ways. Our two rescue dogs, the companions that prolonged Betsy's life by filling days with wagging tails and kisses, now rush to lick my face. A friend in London gave birth to a girl the weekend Betsy passed, gifting me the circle of life. In the sweep of history, we are on this planet for a fraction of a fraction of any measurable unit of time.

All of this reflection makes me wonder about pie, which for more than a thousand years has brought comfort to humans. We all seek our larger purpose.

(CNN) As 17-year-old Simone Jacques welcomed some 10,000 protesters demanding racial justice in San Francisco, she told of how people kept asking whether she and her fellow organizers were part of an ""org."" ""We're just youth who grew up in the city,"" she said. ""We're just people who care and love each other and love each other enough to take care of each other.""

On the opposite coast, Kerrigan Williams and Jacqueline LaBayne , ages 22 and 23, organized a sit-in at the US Capitol by mobilizing the followers of Freedom Fighters DC -- most of whom belong to their Generation Z age group. In Bend, Oregon, 21-year-old Adriana Aquarius organized a local protest in her hometown; in Olean, New York, it was 23-year-old Jamel Burney who took the lead; and in Nashville, Tennessee, six teenagers congregated over 20,000 people to call for an end to systemic racism. And it was a 17-year-old, Darnella Frazier, who filmed and published on social media a white Minneapolis police officer pressing his knee on the neck of George Floyd for nearly nine minutes.

We will never know exactly how many have taken to the streets in the past few weeks, protesting the death of Floyd and other African Americans due to police brutality. But we do know this: these protests show that a new generation of young leaders is springing up across the land. A recent survey by University of Maryland sociologist Dana Fisher and a team of researchers in New York, Washington, Los Angeles and London found that half of protesters surveyed were under the age of 30. They are black, brown and white. They are rising up in communities everywhere. They are non-violent, yet passionate. And they offer a glimpse of a much brighter future.

Their promise is something of a surprise. As commentators like Charlotte Alter have recognized, Millennials and Gen Z have endured a series of punishing, almost knock-out blows growing up. They have survived 9/11 and subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Two sharp recessions have left them with the worst economic prospects in decades. Millions have shouldered the burden of ever-increasing college debt. Recently, the global pandemic has not only locked them down socially but left them with a prospect of returning to college life that will be unrecognizable. President John F. Kennedy long ago noted that ""life is unfair,"" but does that apply to entire generations?

To many, this succession of devastating events would prove discouraging and, indeed, these generations have struggled with mental health challenges at a distressing rate. But what we have been seeing is that many Millennials and Gen Zers are also resilient, persistent and fed up with the longstanding history of inequity in our society. They want to be part of a movement to make life fairer, starting with justice for black Americans.

Seven years ago, three young black women in their late 20s and early 30s -- Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Khan-Cullors -- launched #BlackLivesMatter after the murder of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin. They organized more protests after the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York. While #BlackLivesMatter gained significant traction surrounding isolated protests, it had trouble breaking into the mainstream.

Commentators on the right relentlessly attacked its supporters. In 2016, only 27% of Americans viewed Black Lives Matter favorably. But events of recent months, stretching from Covid-19 to the devastation of the economy and the killing of George Floyd, brought emotions to the boiling point. And #BlackLivesMatter became a galvanizing force. A Pew poll shows that public approval of the movement has shot up to 67%.

Generational activism now transcends racial groupings. Lara Putnam, a historian who studies grassroots organizing at the University of Pittsburgh, told Time that, ""communities of color are stepping forward in outrage and saying we can't let this keep happening. But also, there's a young generation of white people who see that vision and are being mobilized to no longer just treat this as somebody else's problem."" Long-time observers can well remember how many white people were tentative about joining the civil rights protests of the 1960s. In recent days, however, Fisher's team of researchers found that 61% of protesters surveyed in New York City and 65% in Washington, DC, were white.

In Minneapolis, 18-year-old Ranay Barton reflected the change in attitude when she went downtown to a memorial for Floyd. ""The first thing that ran through my mind was to be mad at white people,"" she told The New York Times. ""When things like this happen, you tend to segregate yourself. But seeing all the support and solidarity calmed me down. All these people are different colors, from different places, coming together for a purpose. I feel like the world should be like that.""

The activism of these younger generations stems, in part, from being more distraught about by our systematic inequities than their older counterparts. According to the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), almost two-thirds of young Americans say the police killings of African American men are part of a broader problem, compared with 43% of seniors. What is more, among white Americans alone, a Pew Research Center study found 51% of those between ages 18 and 29 believe we have not done enough to assure equal rights for black Americans; only 28% of whites ages between 50 and 64 would say the same.

While there is much that is encouraging, the path ahead for the young, emerging leaders of today is likely to be long and torturous. Resistance won't disappear without a fight. As the civil rights leaders of the 1960s and '70s discovered, the arc of history may bend toward justice -- but it usually needs lots of help.

Joe and Jill Biden: Our most important Thanksgiving tradition,"Joe Biden is the President-elect of the United States. Jill Biden is the future first lady of the United States, an educator and a bestselling author. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) This Thanksgiving, tables throughout our country will have an empty chair.

It may be for the loved one who can't travel or the parent stationed overseas. Perhaps it's for your sister or brother just across town -- staying away to protect everyone during this pandemic, making sure next year will be celebrated together.

The Biden family poses for a picture on Saturday, November 7, 2020. From left: Melissa Cohen, Hunter Biden, Beau Biden, Naomi Biden, President-elect Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, Maisy Biden, Finnegan Biden, Hunter Biden, Natalie Biden, Ashley Biden, and Dr. Howard Krein.

For the families of the Americans lost this year, that chair is another reminder that someone they love will never come home again.

Over the years, the traditions our family created became sacred rituals: making family recipes, passed down from generation to generation, in a warm, crowded kitchen; setting the table with fresh flowers and lighting candles; playing football and games of checkers; taking our ever-growing family photo. Traditions helped us find joy after having our own empty chair at the table. They remind us that, even as so much changes, the bonds of family don't.

This year, our turkey will be smaller and the clatter of cooking a little quieter. There will be no family walks in the cold or playful bickering amongst the grandkids. Like millions of Americans, we are temporarily letting go of the traditions we can't do safely.

I was raped and broken. So I picked up my camera,"Editor’s note: Rosem Morton is a photographer and nurse based in Baltimore. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.

After I was raped, the days felt never ending. It felt like I was clawing myself out of a deep pit, choking, starving, dying. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t work. I was existing in a space where panic attacks were frequent and unpredictable. Where is safety? What is safe? I was overwhelmed and terrified. The feeling was too much and I needed to take the edge off. In trying to make sense of my experience, I picked up my camera and started shooting.

I photographed everything from what I was seeing to what was happening to how I was feeling. I felt like every survivor out there. If there was not enough proof, it did not happen. I kept photographing my proof. The proof of my struggle, of my survival. I learned to process through the lens of a camera. The work transformed itself to an expression of my silenced sorrows and pain.

I spent a lot of time behind closed doors and I started to notice the comings and goings of light. Raising my hand to meet the sun, I remind myself that I am still surviving.

When I told my husband I was assaulted, I said, ""I will go to therapy for a couple of months and put all of this behind me."" By November, I had been seeing my therapist every week for four months. At the end of this session, I broke down in my car and realized the work has only just begun.

“You are safe. You are safe. You are safe.” This was my mantra to calm myself down.

According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), an American is sexually assaulted every 92 seconds. One out of six American women has been a victim of attempted or completed rape. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention links the trauma of sexual violence with a myriad of short- and long-term consequences, including chronic health problems, diminished ability to work and perhaps worst of all, an increased risk of further sexual or intimate partner violence.

These statistics are alarming, yet a year ago I did not give it much thought. I naively believed that if I followed what I was taught — to avoid dark alleys, to avoid dressing too provocatively and to be wary of strangers — I would be above the fray. Instead, aside from shattering my misconceptions, every part of me was shattered by my assault.

In October, I received a phone call from my assaulter. It was not an admission of fault or an apology. It was a phone call to tell me how he felt his actions were justified. The phone call was so devastating that I crashed my car into the garage and broke my side mirror. A few days later, I looked at myself in broken pieces.

On a torn piece of paper, I wrote down the details of my assault for my husband to read “when you are ready.”

This photo, taken in February, was the first time since the assault that I traveled alone to a place where I knew no one.

I kept moving away and saying “no, no, no.” He did not stop. I remember shaking uncontrollably on that warm summer day. It felt like a void consumed me from the inside out. I was left with nothing. I became nothing.

But I don’t want to focus on the details of my assault. For me, the focus is on the aftermath.

I left my assaulter in a daze and walked an hour home. I told my best friend who did not believe or understand me. We had followed everything we were taught to do. How could it happen? It could and it did. I called my husband and he asked me if I reported it. I didn’t. I froze. It’s funny how our body tricks us in order to help us to survive. At that moment, it felt like a day ago when it really was just hours. It felt too late. I felt too late to matter.

A letter from my husband, Ian, reads: “I knew you were strong but now I can see how truly strong you are. You have been challenged more than anyone should have to endure, but I can see the determination and strength in you that will get you through it all. I knew you were special, but now I know just how amazing you are. I can never explain to you how wonderful you are, or how much you mean to me, or the extent to which you have helped me grow. But please know you are the most amazing person I have ever known. Please know I love you for all you are.” My dogs, Maia and Akira, sense the changes. They come one after another, licking and encouraging me to go on.

“Your touch grounds me.” Ian and I tangle our legs closer and closer. These are snippets of my past life, torn down and ready to be rebuilt.

Within a week, I was fortunate enough to find some help. My gynecologist, from whom I sought treatment after the attack, recognized I was in crisis and helped me find the right therapist. I decided to tell more of my friends to garner more support. Instead, I felt more blame and shame.

As I told more people, I endured unsupportive responses. Engaging so early had its cost. It felt like I was bleeding myself dry. I thought I really needed them to believe and support me. All I really needed was to believe and support myself. It was not and is not my fault.

With some of my friends, it seemed like it was easy to ask how I was doing and then easier to ignore me if I gave an honest and uncomfortable answer. The truth is no one is prepared for trauma because no one talks about trauma.

A 20-hour flight is a long time to be in your own head. I am restless and anxious, so I pick up my phone to photograph instead.

The anxiety starts from the core and tries to find its way out.

Later on, I decided to report the rape. People offered their own opinions, most of which were discouraging. They said my life would get turned upside down for a man who would get away with it. They warned me about what court would be like — but not about the trauma of the reporting process. When I told the police officer I was reporting a rape, she took me outside the building and made me state my case in public. She interrupted me and said she could not take my statement.

It was devastating to ask someone to do their job to serve and protect, but it was soul-crushing to have to beg a woman to believe another woman. I spoke to many officers afterward who told me this case was not worth their time. I realize now some of the many reasons why according to 2016 Justice Department numbers, nearly 80% of rapes and sexual assaults go unreported, and RAINN reports that out of 1,000 assaulters, 995 of them will walk free. Too often our culture socializes us to do the easier thing rather than the right thing.

I have always loved wildflowers; I admire their ability to bloom and thrive. In a high-stress job, I fear that the trauma and the stress would collide. How then can I care for my patients?

I started eating a warm bowl of oatmeal every morning. It helps me feel something besides coldness inside. I spent my birthday in March driving back and forth in the pouring rain of Baltimore.

Still, I found another police officer for my statement. I told my story but never heard back about any investigation or followup. Although it hurts, I tell myself I still stood up for myself. Sometimes, it helps. For the most part, photography has helped. It has bridged the gap by allowing my voice I thought was forever silenced to be heard. Over time, I discovered what I ultimately crave. I crave a connection to myself that I lost.

As I complete this photo project, I am learning that rape is not just an assault of the mind and body but also of the voice. I always think about how my life could have been different if had I known back then a story like what ended up happening to me. Maybe when I was raped when I was 18, I would have understood what happened to me. I might have gotten help. Maybe, when I was 27, I wouldn’t have been raped. Maybe it wouldn’t have taken that rape to get me into therapy, where I would begin to make sense of the traumas in my life.

I saw my gynecologist for a follow-up visit. He asked how I was doing and really looked at me. I learned that people are rooting for me.

I am relearning my body and what it means to be intimate again.

I told myself I will get wildflowers tattooed on me one day as a testament to what I have endured.

My husband sometimes asks me: Why are you sharing this work now, so early in your experience? Why can’t it wait? I always answer: Because it is important. It feels necessary. Although this turbulent journey is far from over, I am compelled to speak up and share my story. The world may be determined to silence us, but I am even more determined to speak up and share my story. My project is dedicated to the innocent girl I was and to many others who think they are alone. You’re not.",
James Meredith: I am George Floyd,"James Meredith is a US Air Force veteran, the first black graduate of the University of Mississippi, and the author of "" Three Years in Mississippi "" and the memoir, "" A Mission from God ,"" written with William Doyle. Twenty-five years ago, when Doyle read the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's "" Letter From Birmingham Jail ,"" he was struck by the passage, ""One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, courageously and with a majestic sense of purpose facing jeering and hostile mobs and the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer."" He sought out Meredith and the two have been discussing American history and race relations ever since. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors. View more opinions at CNN.

(CNN) The death of George Floyd last month set us on an entirely new path of history. Perhaps it will lead to the beast of white supremacy, which has cursed this nation since before its history began, finally being conquered.

Black people have always known how powerful and dangerous white supremacy is, but now the entire world is on the march , saying: We're not going to take it anymore. This may be the greatest thing to ever happen to America, and I think it will change the destiny of our nation for the better.

When I was a boy, my father told me that I was on a mission from God to destroy the system of white supremacy and to uplift black and brown people to their proper position. I took his challenge very seriously.

In 1961, as a 28-year-old Air Force veteran of the desegregated military, I sued the state of Mississippi, which was at that time a neo-Confederate, terrorist police state, for the right to get my education at the University of Mississippi. I forced the President of the United States and the Supreme Court to back my rights as an American citizen, and the federal courts ordered me into the university.

In response, the state of Mississippi rebelled and started an insurrection, blocked me and my federal escorts from entering the school, and became a breakaway republic on the issue of race.

President John F. Kennedy sent in thousands of combat troops to crush the rebellion, and the gates of higher education in the United States were opened for all Americans. This victory for me and for the US Constitution shattered the system of state-sponsored white supremacy in Mississippi.

In 1966, while a student at Columbia University Law School, I began a one-man "" March Against Fear "" through Mississippi to inspire black people to vote. On Day Two, I was shot by a sniper, filling my body with pellets that remain under my skin today. Martin Luther King Jr. and the leaders of the civil rights movement came to Mississippi and took up the march, which attracted thousands of people and inspired thousands more to vote.

Federal voting registrars followed in force. There was no turning back. The floodgates of voter registration were opened for all Americans.

Over the years I've made speeches, traveled the world, written books, opened and closed businesses, been a liberal, a conservative, a farmer, husband, father and grandfather. In 2002, I watched with pride as my son Joseph received the Outstanding Doctoral Student Achievement Award at the University of Mississippi business school.

In 2013 I was awarded the Harvard Graduate School of Education Medal for Education Impact, the highest honor given by the school.

And I'm still here, still alive, still going strong, still taking a power walk every day, even through the pandemic.

But when I see people across America -- and around the world -- peacefully marching for racial justice and honoring the memory of George Floyd and other martyrs like Medgar Evers, my best friend and brother-figure from so long ago, I am filled with both joy and hope.

White supremacy may be the most evil beast that's ever stalked the halls of history, and today it may finally be mortally wounded. This happened for two reasons. For the first and only time in my life, society was shut down by a pandemic, which prepared the people for an explosion. And then the video of Floyd's death was seen by countless people the world over. Without that video, white supremacy in America might have remained nearly as powerful as it's ever been for the past 500 years.

That video, you see, reveals what my life is all about. I am George Floyd. As a black man growing up in Mississippi in the mid-20th century, I was stripped of all the rights of American citizenship. I was subject to being beaten, tortured or lynched at any moment by a white person who had little reason to fear punishment. I've devoted my life to destroying that reality, and to the idea of honoring the full citizenship rights of every American.

I was married with 2 kids when I realized I'm gay,"Melisa Raney is a freelance writer and editor who lives in Atlanta with her two children. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Explore CNN's coverage of LGBTQ trailblazers at cnn.com/pride

(CNN) By the time you reach your 30s, you think you know yourself -- your likes, your dislikes, what inspires you, what makes you tick.

But there I was, at 36 years old, realizing I didn't know myself at all.

I had everything I thought made my life perfect. I was married to my best friend and we had two beautiful, healthy and hilarious children, with successful careers and a beautiful home.

My life would change forever after a simple Google search in November 2016. I had just seen Kate McKinnon perform the song ""Hallelujah"" on SNL and discovered that she's a lesbian. That shocked me because she didn't fit the awful stereotype often depicted in the media.

I quickly declared her my ""new girl crush."" But it was more than that.

At that moment, I realized that I wanted a relationship with a woman like her -- but I felt terrible for even having this thought, as someone who was faithfully married.

It was slowly becoming clear to me that I was not straight.

How could I not know? I had my first ""boyfriend"" in the 3rd grade. I had already decided I was straight. How do you go back on that after being with guys for 20+ years?

Where I fell on the sexuality spectrum would take me the better part of two years to figure out. A part of myself wasn't living. And by not letting that part live, I was slowly dying.

Unraveling a life

There's a price of admission for coming out as gay later in life. Over the course of several months, I paid the price daily. It was like I was watching a movie about myself but unable to control what was unfolding. Everything fell apart.

I did my best to slowly confide in my husband. But I kept many of my feelings inside to avoid hurting him. He tried to be supportive, but he also needed answers.

He felt unsettled and scared about the uncertainty of our future. He asked several times if I was a lesbian. It was a question that felt impossible to answer because I knew what that answer would mean.

I kept waiting for the moment where I would realize I was no longer gay so I could put a halt to everything. My family was being shattered and I couldn't stop it. I constantly had to remind myself, ""You get one life. This is your life and no one else's.""

I felt alone. I was crumbling and desperately looking for someone who could relate. I Googled to the ends of the earth looking for stories like mine. They were few and far between -- and none seemed to touch on just how difficult the journey ahead of me could be.

By early 2018, my husband and I separated in an effort to give me some perspective. I lost time with my children as we began a shared custody schedule. I was consumed by the pit in my stomach -- the shame of ending my marriage because I was gay was like lugging a sandbag over my shoulders and having a rock in my stomach at the same time. I couldn't eat. My weight dropped by the day. For the first time since I met my husband, we went a full day without speaking.

I wasn't sure how to tell my conservative, Georgia-born and bred parents that their former pageant queen daughter was ending her marriage because she is gay. I'm very close with my parents -- a phone call with my mom is almost a daily occurrence.

I confided in my sister first. I wasn't brave enough to actually say the words -- the label of being gay or a lesbian was too much for my soul to bear at the time -- so I sent her a text message, ""I am not straight.""

She responded perfectly, asking if she could buy a Pride flag and offered to tell my parents.

Later that day, I got two of the most relieving texts from my parents that I've ever received.

I didn't realize until then how important it was to be accepted by my parents. I'm a grown woman, fully independent of my mom and dad -- but I still needed their love and acceptance.

Living my truth

Telling my family wasn't the end of my journey. I was finally figuring out who I was. Now I was ashamed by that answer.

That began to subside when I met other women in various stages of the coming out process, all on the same path. Hearing the experience of others felt like hearing my own: married to wonderful men, mothers of amazing kids, the perfect life practically every woman strives for.

Through this group, led by a therapist, we quickly determined we are in this together. We were on a path that feels impossible to navigate until one day, you can live your truth and be perfectly fine shaping a new life.

That's what I'm striving to do now: shape a new life that includes my now ex-husband and my kids. Our family structure just looks a little different than it used to. We spend most holidays together, attend parent-teacher conferences, we even have plans to take the kids to Disney World in the fall.

We no longer have the perfect suburban home together, but we are both navigating new relationships and have found people who understand the importance of us both being present for our children.

On New Year's Day this year, I came out on social media. I expected to see my friend list tick down but instead I was met by love and support. So many people choose to keep their private lives private, which I absolutely understand and respect.

But what so many don't realize is that sharing your tough moments can make other people's tough moments a little easier.

I don't think I would have been able to accept who I am as quickly as I did without the changes in American society in recent years. When I was growing up in the 1980s, someone's sexuality was only spoken about in hushed voices, as if the person had a disease they didn't want others to know about.

Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg -- who, like me, is in his late 30s and, like me, came out publicly just a few years ago -- put it this way : ""It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife. If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would've swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water.""

There is so much truth in his statement. There was such a big part of me that did not want to be gay. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a gay person over the age of 30 who hasn't felt this way.

On the flip side, it is getting better for younger generations. When I told my kids last year that if mom remarries, it will be to a woman -- it didn't faze them in the least.

Throughout all of this, I would have loved to have known that I was going to come out on the other side and be OK. And I want people reading my story to know that it's OK to be the person you're meant to be -- no matter what your age is when you finally get to know yourself and love who you are in the process.",2019-06-06 00:00:00
Crystal Ball: What will happen next year?,"Each December, we ask a group of CNN contributors and commentators for their predictions on some of the big events in the coming year. Some picks are expected, some surprising, and sometimes even our fearless prognosticators admit they have no idea what to pick! See whose prior predictions have come true.

2019 Which film will win the Oscar for best picture in 2019? “Green Book” won the Academy Award for Best Picture. SE Cupp CNN commentator I’ve seen close to no movies (I have a 3-year-old!), but I did get to see “First Man,” and it would certainly get my vote. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor I'm going to bet on “A Star is Born,” even though “BlacKkKlansman” probably deserves it more. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst It continues to rankle me that the stodgy, tradition-oriented Academy still relegates documentary films to their own separate category. But let’s hope there’s a break with tradition this year, and the wonderful documentary on Fred Rogers -- “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” -- wins. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor Crowd-pleasing films such as “Black Panther” or “A Star is Born” could emerge victorious, even if they were not the best movies of the year. But the deserving winner will be “Roma,” a gripping black-and-white reminiscence about a turbulent time in Mexico and the life of a domestic worker. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst My vote is for “A Star is Born” -- great chemistry between the two stars. And it was full of surprises -- Bradley Cooper, an actor who I thought could act, but not sing, turned out to be able to do both. And Lady Gaga, who I thought could sing, but not act, surprised me with her theatrical chops. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Final three for me are “BlacKkKlansman,” “A Star is Born” and “Black Panther.” While I think “A Star is Born” will win, I’m rooting for Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman.” Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor So many great movies this year -- from Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman,” Barry Jenkins’ adaption of the James Baldwin novel, “If Beale Street Could Talk,” and Marvel’s “Black Panther.” I’m going with “Beale Street” for the Oscar win. Confession: I never saw “A Star is Born” -- you can’t top Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in the 1976 version. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor “Black Panther.” Hollywood makes a statement embracing a film that represented both a cultural movement and historical moment -- one that illustrated the power of film to achieve the universal through the story of black and African diasporic identities. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor “Black Panther” or “BlacKkKlansman,” neither of which Trump would ever watch. But I think the Spike Lee-directed film “BlacKkKlansman” takes home the statue. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator “A Star is Born.” Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor Best picture will likely go to “A Star Is Born.” It has everything Academy voters love: a Hollywood storyline, A-list stars, a cinematic legacy and strong box-office performance. Timothy Stanley Historian In a sane world, Best Picture would go to “First Man,” a movie that looks big -- it’s about the Apollo moon mission -- but actually deals with something small and human, one man’s alienation from the world around him. It’s as close to poetry as Hollywood gets. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator My money is on “Black Panther” because it was a high-action blockbuster, and it delivers an important political message: With great power comes great responsibility. In addition, the movie breaks Hollywood barriers that should have been broken many years ago. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Lady Gaga can regurgitate anecdotes until the cows come home, and I’d still be delighted if “A Star Is Born” won. But I suspect “Widows” will sneak round the back and win it. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor My heart yearns for Wakanda (“Black Panther”), but the Academy is likely going to go Lady Gaga (“A Star is Born”).

2019 The 2020 race: Which Democrat running for president will lead the polls of Democratic voters at the end of 2019? Which Republican will lead the polls of that party’s voters? SE Cupp CNN commentator Of the 300 people who will run, I imagine Beto O’Rourke will have the best chance of navigating the primary and cutting through with voters. On the other side, I can’t envision a convincing challenger to Trump will emerge (though one can dream). Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor I predict Bernie Sanders will lead the polls at the end of 2019, based primarily on name recognition. He will not be the nominee in 2020. And I feel fairly confident in predicting that Trump will be his party's nominee. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst My early money leans toward Beto O’Rourke (who recently met with President Obama to discuss a 2020 run) as a 2019 frontrunner. And I don’t foresee any emergent Republican candidate that could contend with an unleashed, nothing-to-lose Donald Trump in the Republican primary. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor With hordes of lawmakers, governors and businesspeople pondering a run, and Democrats energized for victory, the polls will confound the experts and baffle campaign managers. Familiar names -- Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders -- will lead early, driven largely by name recognition. Late in the year, the horserace will favor Senator Amy Klobuchar, who will lead the pack. On the GOP side, Trump will lead, but he will face a serious challenger. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst I think Beto O’Rourke will lead the Democratic contenders -- he is inspiring, a visionary and also a man of the people. Meanwhile, Trump, the disruptive and divisive President, will lead the Republicans. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Beto O’Rourke will lead the Democratic pack, and Donald Trump will still lead the Republicans. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Republican voters will turn on Donald Trump and look to Vice President Mike Pence to run for president. Democrats, angry and eager to take back the Oval, won’t stray too far left from traditional names or politics. Joe Biden will be the guy most Democrats trust to lead and heal the nation -- but his only hope of winning in 2020 is to have a progressive woman, like Kamala Harris, as his running mate. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor Beto O’Rourke will lead the Democrats, since he is the first Democratic candidate since Barack Obama to inspire a belief in civic ideals, social justice and the grand notion that America belongs to all of us. And Donald Trump will lead the Republicans, as he continues to play to his base of nationalists and populists. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator Beto O'Rourke will be ahead for the Democrats, and Donald Trump, assuming he is still in office (which isn’t a sure thing), will be ahead for Republicans. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor The Democrat’s frontrunner will be Joe Biden, while the Republican frontrunner will be Donald Trump. But this will be more about name recognition and familiarity than anything else; once the 2020 race is really underway, all bets are off. Timothy Stanley Historian Trump is obviously a shoe-in for the Republican nomination, but the Democratic field remains such a mess that I wouldn’t be surprised if the polls are dominated by a celebrity (Oprah), someone who won’t run (Joe Biden) or the eternal candidacy of Hillary Clinton. Biden, however, will be the most popular because he’s the most realistic populist liberal. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator I will be keeping my eyes on Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke, who represents the young face that the Democrats want with the strong fundraising ability that they need. He ran a solid race for Senate in 2018, but his policies were too blue for Texas. President Trump has maintained high approval among his base, and I expect him to lead the GOP polls at the end of the year. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor In the UK, there is a popular Twitter phenomenon known as “the banter timeline.“ This is the notion that of all the possible courses our future might have taken, the one we are living is so patently ridiculous that the gods must have designed it purely for ”the banter.“ The banter timeline would dictate that the Democrat candidate leading by the end of 2019 would be Hillary Clinton. (Though she wouldn’t necessarily have the best odds of winning.) I suspect the Republicans will prefer to stick with the devil they know -- and choose Trump. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor The knives are already out on social media between the various factions of the Democratic Party, and history has shown us that undermining the future candidate (and the process that selects him or her) produces the worst of all possible outcomes. If pressed, I'll say Kamala Harris/Beto O'Rourke looks like our best bet for victory, but it'll depend on who President Pelosi decides to endorse. Either way, GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney will find a way to lose.

2019 Brexit: Will the UK leave the EU in 2019, and if it does, will it be with or without an agreed-upon deal? SE Cupp CNN commentator It’s the law, so I think it will happen regardless of a deal. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor No, they won't leave this year -- they'll either delay and/or re-vote. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst As I understand it, the “divorce” is now compulsory, with the exit date scheduled for March 29. To delay this -- or nullify it -- would require change to British law, along with an agreement from the rest of the EU. So, absent a change in law, I foresee the departure occurring with an agreed-upon final deal to be reached at a later date. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor Prime Minister Theresa May’s efforts to implement a decision she opposes -- pulling the UK out of the European Union -- will fail. Her plan will be rejected and the option of leaving without a deal will seem so scary that Britain will hold a second referendum. After having voted so casually the first time around, frantically checking the implications after voting, Britons will vote to remain and Brexit will be over. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst The UK will leave, with a deal: That’s what the masses want. And nobody does anything without a deal. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Yes, the UK will leave the EU and there will eventually be a deal struck -- messy as it seems now. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor British Prime Minister Theresa May came to office after the Brexit vote and has been struggling ever since to get a deal that satisfies all parties. As European leaders stand firm on their terms for Brexit, it seems certain Great Britain will leave the EU in 2019 without a deal. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor The UK will stay in the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May averts political disaster by allowing the nation to gracefully come to its senses regarding their place in the world. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor No deal. The government will collapse, and new elections will delay it all. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator The UK won’t leave without a deal because it will send the country and markets into chaos. But the deadline for a deal is fast approaching in March and one option would be for another referendum vote. Given the trends and demographics in the UK, a vote to stay in the EU is not out of the question. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor Yes, the UK will be leaving the EU on March 29, 2019, because it is the law, deal or no deal. With that deadline looming and little progress made so far on major issues like trade and customs, it seems likely -- and unfortunate -- that Britain will exit without a deal in place. Timothy Stanley Historian Right now, it looks like Britain either won’t leave the EU in 2019, or it will leave without a deal. Most likely, though, it will leave without a deal. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator The fact that British Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence by Conservative Party lawmakers indicates Brexit will happen. May has made it clear she is focused on delivering an orderly exit from the EU, and I expect that to happen. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Answers to this change roughly every 12 hours, but I reckon, despite the daily option tombola, we'll leave the EU with the agreed deal in 2019. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor I predict the UK will leave the EU without a deal, followed by Northern Ireland, Scotland and the City of London leaving the UK.

2019 50 years after men first walked on the moon, what will be the year’s biggest space exploration story? SE Cupp CNN commentator Commercial space exploration happening next year -- both SpaceX and Boeing are looking to send NASA astronauts. I’m also available, guys! Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor Fingers crossed it's Jeff Bezos launching himself into space. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst 2019 could be the year of the US Space Force, as Pentagon and Trump administration officials remain deeply engaged in discussions on the topic. If the Russians have had one on-and-off since the early 1990s, why can’t we? Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor Entrepreneurs Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos, racing to privatize space travel, will send their first tourists into orbit. That will become the top space story of the year. But for those of us who remain earthbound, nothing will beat the thrill of watching the International Space Station streaking gently across the sky. You can do what I do, sign up with NASA for alerts when the ISS flies over your house. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst SpaceX and/or Boeing will launch NASA astronauts inside commercial space ships. Thereafter, it’ll become accessible to the masses (who have enough money to pay for seats). Scott Jennings CNN contributor Non-astronauts will fly into space -- albeit briefly -- on a commercially purchased ticket. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor A human-led expedition to Mars, comprised of volunteer American citizens, scientists and others from across the globe – and funded by Elon Musk’s SpaceX project. Add my name to the list. This #Trekkie is ready to “seek out new life and new civilizations.” Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor In 2019, we will send an unmanned space probe to Mars -- bringing us one step closer to successfully landing astronauts on the red planet. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor We send NASA astronauts into Trump’s brain to figure out what is going on with him. There is clearly a great deal of space there to explore. Or, perhaps more realistically, commercial flights successfully head into space. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator We will learn a lot more about the climate on Mars, thanks to NASA. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor Space tourism -- the race between rich guys Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk to send paying passengers into outer space. Timothy Stanley Historian We’re still dreaming of going to Mars, but my hope for 2019 is that someone finally explores us: an alien who took the wrong turn around Venus. I’d like to hand them the keys to the planet and let them run it for a while, and if they occasionally eat us, it’ll still be an improvement on the current management. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator The most important space story for 2019 concerns progress being made to prioritize the national security issues related to space, in an effort to stay competitive with China and Russia. The establishment of the New Space Command is a step closer to President Trump's desired Space Force, which would ensure the safety of US spacecraft and astronauts in space. I support the idea of the Space Force, but believe it can be accomplished in the current structure of the US military. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Chinese aircraft Chang’e-4 is due to land on the dark side of the moon. I think it's extraordinary that, despite the fact we've gone so much farther afield already, this will be the first time humans have explored the unseen side of our satellite. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor Elon Musk's orbital Tesla is going to make a first encounter with intelligent alien life.

2019 What will the Dow Jones end at in 2019? Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor It will be down 0.3%, a number I have selected for absolutely no reason. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst Though my enthusiasm for tracking the market summary waned following the evaporation of the vast majority of my 401(k) on that darkest of days of 2008, I am going to predict we'll be somewhere around where we are right now, in the 24,000 range. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor The stock market euphoria that greeted Donald Trump’s election, like many other illusions, is now over. The Dow was already rising nicely in 2016 and the optimism continued in 2017. The party has ended. In 2019, the market will fall in the first part of the year and start recovering in the latter part. Final Dow: 22,500. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst 25,783 -- market remains strong, with ebbs and flows Scott Jennings CNN contributor Take your Dramamine® and delete your favorite stock ticker from your phone. A flat year is a win at 23,900. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Expect more dizzying ups and downs in early 2019, as the results of Trump’s trade wars, attacks on tech companies, and other policies unsettle investors. Then, the Dow will slow down considerably and level off around 26,000, as investors pull back and America braces for the 2020 presidential election. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor 22,000. The President’s resumption of trade wars with China and other parts of the world keeps skittish investors on their toes. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor 26,342, so slightly better than it is today. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator With rising uncertainty in the global marketplace over China and a slowdown in growth, the Dow will go down next year to 23,000. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor Dow Jones will end around 21,000 in 2019, due to domestic political instability and growing economic uncertainty over Trump’s trade policies. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator When it comes to the Dow and polling, I follow trends and not daily snapshots. We are ending 2018 close to where we started in January, around 24,800, so I will say we will end 2019 in that rage, around 24,600. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Much like the cult hero of “Legally Blonde,” Elle Woods, I suspect the DJ will “bend and snap.” That is to say: the hugely volatile political landscape internationally in 2019 and new trade arrangements will see everything vulnerable for a while, but it will settle roughly back where it started by Christmas -- hovering around 24,000. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor It'll depend on whether stock prices are being calculated in rubles or in renminbi, I guess. For now, closer to 15,000.

2019 What will be the Grammys’ Album of the Year? Country singer Kacey Musgraves took home the Grammy for her album, “Golden Hour.” SE Cupp CNN commentator Cardi B's ""Invasion of Privacy."" Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor It had damn well better be Janelle Monaé. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst “Beerbongs and Bentleys” and “Dirty Computer” are really two of the nominees? Since no music from the 1970s was nominated, I guess the Grammy for Album of the Year goes to “Black Panther” -- only because I enjoyed the movie and because I don't recognize any of the other albums nominated. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor The most striking feature of the Grammy awards will be the dominance of women, who will shine in most categories after last year’s embarrassment. The winner will be the unpretentiously likeable folk singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile, nominated for six Grammys. Best album: “By the Way, I Forgive You.” Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst Cardi B: “Invasion of Privacy.” She’s a rising star who is authentic, fresh, new and raw. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Unless it is on “Kids Place Live” on SiriusXM, I probably haven’t heard it. I will go with “Scorpion” by Drake. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy” wins Album of the Year because I love imperfect, confident, self-made women. And as a child of the original hip-hop generation, I always want this beautiful, unapologetically black musical genre to win on the big stage. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor The “Black Panther” album will win. A cultural milestone that dominated 2018 reaps full rewards and recognition across multiple platforms, led by the Pulitzer Prize-winning icon Kendrick Lamar. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor I’ll go with Drake’s album. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator Cardi B. It is the year of the rapper with a huge number of nominations, and whether you like her or not, she is the most talked-about and fascinating musical artist this year. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor The Grammys have not always been inclusive when it comes to women and hip-hop artists. 2019 will be different when Cardi B wins best Album for “Invasion of Privacy.” Timothy Stanley Historian I cannot predict the winner of the Grammys because I don't listen to contemporary music; it all sounds like noise to me, either people shouting at each other or operating industrial machinery. I am amused, though, to see Rick Astley is recording again -- that man really never gives up. I'd give the prize to him. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator I am not a fan of potty-mouth music, so that doesn’t help in my predictions. I would like to see Brandi Carlile’s “By the Way, I Forgive You” album win, but I believe Drake’s “Scorpion” will get the nod in 2019. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor The “Black Panther” album is wicked, but I suspect it will be either Janelle Monae’s year or Drake’s. Drake has a lot of nominations though, so perhaps Monae will take best album and he can hoover up the rest. I guess it all comes down to (sorry) God’s Plan. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor The Robert Mueller Sessions, Vol. 1-8 would be my pick, but it’ll probably be “Black Panther.” However, anyone but Post Malone is fine by me.

2019 Who will win the World Series? And who will win the MLB’s first regular season London games in June -- the Yankees, the Red Sox, or will there be a split? The Yankees won both games in London. SE Cupp CNN commentator I always have to bet on my Mets -- because by law Mets fans are required to be delusional. But in reality, the Red Sox for the series win and for the London games. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor Let's say Red Sox for both, because even spending almost all of one's adult life in New York can't make a person root for the Yankees. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst I do this every year -- vote with my heart and choose my hometown Atlanta Braves. And since I’m married to a diehard New York Yankees fan – the Yanks over the Sawx in London. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor The Los Angeles Dodgers will win the World Series. The Yankees will win the London series. The Brits will fiercely debate the merits of baseball and conclude with great satisfaction that, while their brush with baseball was not quite a damp squib, cricket remains superior. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst Yankees & Yankees. They are overdue, and they have the talent to make great things happen. Scott Jennings CNN contributor St. Louis Cardinals ride Paul Goldschmidt’s 40 home runs campaign to the World Series title. Red Sox beat Yanks overseas. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor And the Yankees win -- including in London. No way my team allows the Red Sox, Astros, Dodgers or any other team to ruin our dynasty. Loaded with cash to spend on super star free agents, the Commissioner’s Trophy returns home to New York in 2019. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor Yankees for both, since they have upgraded their pitching and have several important players returning to start their lineup. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor The NY Mets will turn it around and stun the world in 2019. The Yankees will sweep the London series, beating the Red Sox so badly that some Red Sox players will actually defect to the United Kingdom instead of returning home to face the embarrassment. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator Red Sox in the US, Red Sox in London. The only thing I like about baseball is hot dogs, so I am relying on my baseball-loving husband for his prediction. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor The Dodgers are going to win the series because I am from LA, and I believe! Go Dodger Blue! The Red Sox will win the MLB London games. Timothy Stanley Historian I don't follow baseball, but I've lived in Washington, DC, so my team is the Nationals. For London, I think the British would most enjoy a Red Sox win. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator I’m a Braves fan, but I predict the Houston Astros will win the World Series in 2019. They have a strong pitching rotation with Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole -- and that will help in the coming year. It will be exciting to watch MLB in London and see how folks across the pond respond. I would like to see a split with Yankees and Red Sox each winning a game. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor I am terrible on sport, for which I would rather blame traumatic physical education experiences than an inherent disinterest in teamwork (ahem). However, my highly scientific Twitter survey earlier today suggested that the Dodgers are a reasonable shout for the Series, and the Red Sox will win the closely-contested London games. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor I'm going to say the Yankees for both. Don't Aaron Judge me.

2019 What will President Trump’s approval rating be at the end of 2019? SE Cupp CNN commentator I’m guessing Democratic investigations will actually help him slightly, so I’ll put him at a 48%. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor Forty percent because a lot of people are terrible. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst Somewhere around the intersection of “piss a third of the country off,” “make a third of the country gleeful” and “leave all of us wondering why no one spellchecks his tweets prior to posting.” Which is to say, I think his approval will be a soft 42%. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor In the months ahead, Americans will learn more about the dealings of the Trump campaign, the Trump presidency and the Trump family. The investigations brewing for the past two years will come to a boil and the Democratic-led House of Representatives will hold public hearings on scandal after scandal. Approval rating: 29%. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst Thirty-three percent -- he is just too disruptive and divisive. Additionally, he will be impeached by then. Scott Jennings CNN contributor I think it’ll remain close to what it is today, ending at 42%. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Trump’s approval rating will hover around 35%, unless the President can deflect America's attention from the results of Mueller’s Russia investigation. Trump will be impeached by the House, and even if the mostly-GOP Senate fails to convict, Trump will be disgraced and pressured to resign. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor Forty percent. The President manages to hold onto virtually 100% of his base of support, irrespective of his policies, speeches or actions. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor That assumes Trump will be President. If he is still President by then, I think it’ll hover at 35%. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator Under 40. How far under 40 depends first on the economy and second on Mueller, but I’d predict just below 30%. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor For the President, it is all downhill from here. With the Mueller probe notching more guilty pleas and indictments, and the economy showing signs of weakness, his approval rate will tumble to 33%. Timothy Stanley Historian Trump’s approval rating seems to have a ceiling of 45% and is heavily concentrated in rural areas. I predict it will remain just that. He deserves to poll better given the state of the economy, yet cannot make inroads because his personality and cultural politics alienate half the country. He is the embodiment of polarization. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator Fearing the outcome of the Mueller investigation, I expect President Trump’s approval rating at the end of 2019 will drop to around 40% -- with disapproval of 55%. A strong economy will go a long way to helping the approval rating. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor I think the President's approval rating will be 37% -- similar to his lowest point so far (as a pollster average) in December last year. Pressure is mounting on all sides -- from Mueller to clashes with Congress over the border wall to the continued revelations about his seemingly crooked property empire. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor I think that it is a safe bet that Donald Trump will set a record for lowest approval before next year is out (and before he is). My prediction: based on Gallup polling dating back to Harry Truman’s presidency, Trump would be the first POTUS in recent history with a sub-20% rating.

2019 Who will win the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history. SE Cupp CNN commentator Green Bay Packers -- it’s our year, I can feel it. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor My hometown team, the Seattle Seahawks. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst With my beloved Atlanta Falcons all but eliminated from playoff contention, how many days until pitchers and catchers report? But if I'm to be forced into this, I think it will be the Houston Texans, who beat the Chicago Bears, 35-17. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor The New Orleans Saints will defeat the Kansas City Chiefs. It will be a great match, but with smallish-city teams in the big game, viewership will be at record lows. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst Los Angeles Rams -- great young quarterback, talented running back and lots of secret weapons. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Los Angeles Rams. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Coach Sean Payton and his New Orleans Saints will win the Super Bowl in Atlanta. I had sweet dreams of my Philadelphia Eagles repeating this season, but those dreams died long ago. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor Dallas Cowboys. The addition of Amari Cooper, the talent of Ezekial Elliot and the steadiness of Dak Prescott fuel the Cowboys toward a surprisingly deep playoff run and their first Super Bowl victory since 1996. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor New York Giants. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator New Orleans Saints -- rooting for the over-40 quarterback! Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor The Super Bowl is in Atlanta, but the championship is going to the City of Angels -- Los Angeles Rams! Timothy Stanley Historian I have no idea who will win the Super Bowl, but I'm a Catholic and I've always liked the name ""Arizona Cardinals."" It makes me think of a priest on horseback. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator I’m going to go with Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints. They have had a strong offensive season, and they get bonus points for having “Choppa Style” dance moves to help them celebrate. I also expect Drew Brees to win MVP. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Maroon 5 have already won -- I don’t care how many hits they have, it is absurd that they (probably) got that gig. But if you force me to choose an actual team, I’d say the Saints. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor Let’s go with the Kansas City Native Americans.",

""People are thinking 'I may have lost a loved one, but also I may have lost my country.' You feel so sad, terribly sad... The motto of Haiti is 'L'union fait la force': 'in unity there is strength.'

In moments like this, you cling to that. You cling to everything. It makes me remember that this is a country that didn't have a chance when it began, a nation of slaves becoming the world's first black republic. You have to draw from this historical precedent and hope there will be a rebirth.""

Brave. Groundbreaking. Badass. Notorious: The year in culture,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) —

This year, what did nationalism, pansexual, maverick, respect and excelsior all have in common?

The short answer is that all of them appeared on Merriam-Webster’s list of notable words of 2018.

The longer answer is that the words we look up and use to define or express ourselves tell the story of our lives, individually and as a country.

Several of these words tell the story of profound loss: “Maverick” spiked after the death of John McCain; “respect” following the passing of legendary Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin; “excelsior” in the wake of world-creator Stan Lee’s departure.

One of these words also tells a story of empowerment: Merriam-Webster said lookups for “pansexual” surged after Janelle Monae came out as such in a cover story for Rolling Stone. Language clearly matters to Monae, whose groundbreaking album “Dirty Computer” earned a Grammy nomination for album of the year, and whose body of work, wrote Kerra Bolton in May, uses “unique style to create a vocabulary and cultural conversation about what it means to be a black woman in the United States,” forging in the process “the intersectional feminism of our times.”

Ultimately, Merriam-Webster’s word of the year was “justice,” a choice that, in combination with Dictionary.com’s “misinformation” and Oxford Dictionary’s “toxic,” asserted historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, “certainly tell(s) a story about the state of public consciousness.” Justice “took a hit” in 2018, Ben-Ghiat said, but she embraced “freedom … to write and say what we think” as her own word of the year.

In the young life of this column (and our newsletter, Provoke/Persuade), we’ve looked back each weekend at some of the strongest opinion of the preceding week. With a new year on the horizon, this week we’re highlighting some of the top cultural criticism and social commentary of 2018. (You can also see our most popular CNN Opinion pieces here.)

A year of “Becoming” a nation embracing politics and poetry

Photo Illustration/getty images/alberto mier

If the words we look up tell our story in black and white, the books we read give that story color. In Electric Literature, Rebecca Makkai asked a question many could relate to: “The world’s on fire. Can we still talk about books?”

(Spoiler alert: Yes, and how!)

Poet and critic Tess Taylor made room to read Emily Wilson’s translation of “The Odyssey” with her son; she called it “the thrilling tale getting them through 2018.”

In a year when expressions of hate were horrifyingly relevant, “Educated,” Tara Westover’s account of growing up in and escaping from a survivalist childhood in Idaho, touched a nervy place of fascination with how extremist ideology operates. Slate’s podcast, “Standoff,” interviewed Westover as it revisited the 1992 siege at Ruby Ridge, still a flashpoint for many on the far right.

“Becoming,” first lady Michelle Obama’s memoir, was the best-selling hardcover book of 2018. With a buzzy national tour punctuated by newsmaking disclosures (thinking “Bye Felicia!” as she left the White House), some were ready to dismiss the former FLOTUS (and her Balenciaga boots). But as both Kate Brower and Laura Beers articulated in November, Michelle Obama’s candor on difficult topics – marriage counseling and in vitro fertilization, respectively – reflected a dynamic, enduring model of leadership. Michelle Obama herself touted the central importance of women’s leadership on International Day of the Girl: “We’re seeking to empower adolescent girls around the world through education, so that they can support their families, communities and countries.”

When it comes to books in 2018, it wasn’t all about the here and now. Zora Neale Hurston’s posthumously published “Barracoon: The Story of the Last ‘Black Cargo,’” an account of the last survivor of the last slave ship written between 1928 and 1931, received wide acclaim. “Barracoon” was a big deal, observed scholar Ellen Gruber Garvey, because its story disrupts formulas of “white supremacist myth-making in action.”

In June, the National Endowment for the Arts found that the number of Americans who say they’ve read poetry in the past year was up for the first time since 1992. As poet laureate Tracy K. Smith, who launched a podcast called “The Slowdown” this fall, pointed out in The New York Times, reading poetry “has become a means of owning up to the complexity of our problems, of accepting the likelihood that even we the righteous might be implicated by or complicit in some facet of the very wrongs we decry.”

Brave. Groundbreaking. Badass. Notorious.

For every #MeToo breakthrough, it seems women face two more setbacks. Or as Danielle Campoamor put it back in September, “Ariana Grande reminds us women have no safe place in America.” Grande endured being groped by a pastor while performing at Aretha Franklin’s funeral only to be eviscerated online after her ex-boyfriend died tragically.

At the same time, as 2018 was drawing to a close, American women hit a historic benchmark with Martha McSally’s appointment as an Arizona senator: in 2019, women will, for the first time, hold 25 Senate seats. This is a game changer, wrote Marianne Schnall, because it constitutes critical mass – the tipping point where a group can transform an institution’s culture.

Anyone looking for a badass woman on screen in 2018 found one in Elizabeth Jennings on “The Americans.” Played by the heavily nominated Keri Russell, Elizabeth upended conventions of gender and power on screen by making motherhood what I called “the ultimate disguise.”

Luckily for those who need a badass in real life, there’s Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Julie Cohen and Betsy West, directors of acclaimed documentary “RBG,” aren’t surprised by the Notorious RBG’s superhuman resilience amid health challenges: “During production of our documentary, we and our camerawoman were often exhausted trying to keep up with her – whether at a law school speaking engagement, at the gym or at the opera. One night, after an especially grueling day of shooting, we were just eager to get some sleep. The justice let slip that she was going home to put the finishing touches on her latest dissent.”

And as Louise Knight explained, in the opening lines of “RBG,” when Ginsburg says, “I ask no favor for my sex. … All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks,” she was quoting a 19th-century powerhouse, abolitionist and feminist Sarah Grimke – who prophesied that one day a woman would sit in the seat of chief justice of the US Supreme Court.

The revolution may not be televised, but in 2018 it was still happening on screen

Even in the midst of a low point in American race relations, observed Gene Seymour, black storytelling on screen and on the page – from “Black Panther” to “If Beale Street Could Talk” to electrifying debut fiction and poetry collections – “showed a broad multiplicity of voices and made a deep impact on pop culture throughout 2018.”

Representations of race on screen weren’t just a revolution unfolding in fictional worlds, as Isha Sesay and Peniel Joseph made clear. At the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May, Sesay argued, “we heard a civil rights protest song performed in the home of the British monarchy as the whole world watched. She invited a black pastor (the Rev. Michael Curry) to preach to the world the words of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. She walked herself to the man she has chosen to marry.”

Weeks later, as the French played for the World Cup title, the world watched as a team made up of primarily black and Muslim players lifted the trophy. For Joseph, the victory was a rare moment of optimism for the future of immigration, globalization, and citizenship.

One of the most revolutionary acts on television this year was a moment of apology and compromise: Pete Davidson and Dan Crenshaw’s joint plea for unity on “Saturday Night Live” after backlash against Davidson, whose father died on 9/11, for mocking Crenshaw, who has extensive war injuries.

“It was a beautiful moment, unlike anything I can recall on “SNL” – and I worked on the show’s production staff for eight seasons,” recalled Dean Obeidallah. “But the line that stayed with me the most was when he (Crenshaw) said, “We can remember what brings us together as a country and still see the good in each other.”

The year history took over the internet

luoman/E+/Getty Images

2018 was the year history went viral, opined Rebecca Onion for Slate, analyzing how historians used the Twitter thread to bring context and accuracy to the churning maw of the news cycle.

It’s true that #Twitterstorians took center stage this year, among them Manisha Sinha, who outlined what happened the last time a president chose America’s enemies over its friends (hint: there’s a lot more synergy going on between 2018 and Reconstruction than any of us should be comfortable with), and Nicole Hemmer, who lived through and reported on the protests in Charlottesville. Hemmer took to Twitter (and later CNN Opinion) in the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre to show how its terrible seeds were planted in the too-often-overlooked anti-Semitism brought to the surface by the Unite The Right rally.

When the internet went crazy over Mark Knight’s cartoon of Serena Williams, immediately decried as racist, and Drake’s dethroning of the Beatles with seven simultaneous Billboard Top 10 singles, Rebecca Wanzo and Jennifer Stoever were there to remind us why history matters. Wanzo debunked defenses of Knight by citing precedents of racist cartooning against black women going back to the 19th century, while Stoever called a halt in the “Drake vs. Beatles” battle and rejected the “rap vs. rock” cliché as “tired, race-baiting” “sonic misogyny.”

2018: The year of drama and disaster

Looking back on our year in culture inevitably spotlights how hollow the distinction between the arenas of culture and politics has become. Simply put, 2018 was a year of drama and disaster, a swirl of chaos punctuated by works of art and criticism that were at times staggering, creative, provocative and surprising. To borrow from Einat Lev, whose commentary on the Kilauea Volcano was one of CNN Opinion’s top reads of the year, I might apply this quotation to 2018 itself:

“This event – beautiful, destructive, frightening – also presents a moment for all of us to appreciate the immense power of the forces that never cease shaping our planet.”",2018-12-23 00:00:00

(CNN) —

In a year dominated by the Trump presidency and the run-up to the midterm elections, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the ongoing battles raging in Washington and across America. But politicians and policy divides weren’t the only headline makers. Stories of gun violence, celebrity deaths, a royal wedding and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too.

Here are excerpts from a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2018.

Julian Zelizer: Obama’s stern warning for Trump

Julian Zelizer

January 13

To say that Donald Trump is not acting presidential is not to romanticize what we have seen from previous inhabitants of the office. But it is to hold him accountable for going far beyond the proper limits on presidential behavior.

The biggest danger is that by tolerating Trump’s behavior in office, the public will make what he is doing and saying part of our conception of what it means to be presidential.

It is vital that members of both parties admit what they see when these moments happen and avoid normalizing these kinds of reckless departures from presidential history. For if the political class, and the public, starts to brush these moments off as “Trump being Trump” or “nothing worse than what we have seen” we will lower the bar so far it will be impossible to ever repair the presidency.

January 17

As a society, we must take this incident – appearing in the public consciousness during our #MeToo moment – as an opportunity to have some painful, nuanced conversations.

For example: Sexual assault and rape are never the victim’s fault. But we cannot indiscriminately start destroying careers over consensual sexual activity, which based on her account is what this case appears to be.

When we do that, we trivialize the brave victims who are coming forward about actual sex crimes.

Simone Biles: I went from foster care to the Olympics

Megan Battle Schoenberg Simone Biles

February 5

Although I was young when my foster care ordeal began, I remember how it felt to be passed off and overlooked. Like nobody knew me or wanted to know me. Like my talents didn’t count, and my voice didn’t matter.

Finding a family made me feel like I mattered. Finding a passion, something I loved and was really good at, made me feel like I mattered. Representing my country and being part of such an amazing Olympic team matters, as does being a role model for those looking to fulfill their own dreams.

February 15

We can’t ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I’m asking – no, demanding – we take action now.

Why? Because at the end of the day, the students at my school felt one shared experience – our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools.

But this time, my classmates and I are going to hold them to account. This time we are going to pressure them to take action. This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses.

Peggy Drexler: Why does Melania stay?

Jeremy Freeman Peggy Drexler

February 17

But perhaps most important, although divorcing Trump would surely please the “Free Melania” crowd, the first lady hasn’t really shown that she cares much what other people think of her – or needs to be saved.

She has not tried particularly hard to win public approval: Besides her scant appearances and botched RNC address, she’s become known for wearing the wrong things at the wrong time, like when she donned a pair of Manolos to visit victims of Hurricane Harvey. Which is also why it’s perhaps too hopeful to expect that the pressure of these new revelations (which, let’s be honest, are likely not new to her) will cause her to leave the life she seems comfortable in – one that’s very clearly sponsored by, if not warmly inclusive of, the President.

Gloria Borger: The great unraveling: Trump’s allies are really worried about him

Gloria Borger

March 2

Not since Richard Nixon started talking to the portraits on the walls of the West Wing has a president seemed so alone against the world.

One source – who is a presidential ally – is worried, really worried. …

Even by Trumpian standards, the chaos and the unraveling at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue are a stunning – and recurring – problem.

But there’s an up-against-the-wall quality to the past couple of weeks that is striking, and the crescendo is loud, clear, unhealthy, even dangerous.

Paul Callan: The lawyer Trump wants to represent him has been dead for 32 years

CNN Paul Callan

March 24

It’s becoming increasingly clear who President Donald Trump really wants to represent him in the Robert Mueller investigation – and there’s a good reason he can’t have him.

When John Dowd quit this week as lead counsel on Trump’s legal team and the President made an effort to recruit “deep state” conspiracy theorist and conservative legal commentator Joseph diGenova to the team, the conclusion could only be that Trump wants to go to war against Mueller, using the tactics favored by his onetime mentor Roy Cohn.

In effect, the President wants to wage an aggressive, and probably dirty war, on the special counsel. Cohn, having died in 1986, isn’t available. But there may be other lawyers who can fill that role

Jonathan Wackrow, former Secret Service agent: Barbara Bush’s code name was absolutely perfect

Courtesy Jonathan Wackrow Jonathan Wacrkrow

April 19

As a special agent with the United States Secret Service, I had the opportunity to work on many protective assignments with Mrs. Bush. While I was never permanently assigned to her detail, I am thankful for two specific moments with Mrs. Bush, ones I will cherish as defining experiences in my career and testaments to her legacy, her candor and grace.

The first occurred when I was a new agent, assigned to work a midnight shift at the Bush family’s summer residence in Kennebunkport, Maine. I was walking in the front yard at daybreak, preparing to end my shift, when Mrs. Bush suddenly appeared.

In my world, it was better to be unseen, but in this instant, I was in the former first lady’s full view with nowhere to hide. Mrs. Bush gave me the warmest smile and said, “Well, it is good morning for me, but it looks like you have been up all night, so I will wish you a good night’s sleep.” Stunned, I thanked her.

Paul Begala: Sean Hannity is a welfare queen

Paul Begala

April 23

Sean Hannity is a lot of things. Needy isn’t one of them. Greedy, in President Reagan’s framing, seems more like it. Perhaps the program that guarantees Hannity’s investments is a wise one. Perhaps, on the other hand, it is a wasteful welfare program. That’s not the point. It’s the hypocrisy, stupid.

Hannity is a very wealthy man. So is Donald Trump. It appears that part of the way they became rich was by decrying welfare for poor folks, then grabbing it for themselves. They view their voters, their viewers, as saps. Stooges. Suckers. As another great huckster said, there’s one born every minute. And Hannity is laughing all the way to the bank.

Einat Lev: Why Hawaii’s volcano is in danger of going ballistic

Matt Patrick, USGS Einat Lev

May 10

Everyone has been looking at the Kilauea Volcano’s lava flows. Sure, a wall of molten rock consuming a car is quite the sight. But as we all focus on the damage at Leilani Estates, we shouldn’t forget that volcanoes are complex systems, where everything is connected. New warnings about flying ballistic blocks and sinking lava lakes help us remember!

This event – beautiful, destructive, frightening – also presents a moment for all of us to appreciate the immense power of the forces that never cease shaping our planet. We are reminded by Kilauea to stay humble in the face of nature. And for volcanologists, the eruption is an opportunity to share with the public what we know about how these massive, intricate systems work.

Ivanka’s smile was undoubtedly offered to calm concerns about him and, perhaps, to distract from the mayhem and death that any thoughtful person could have anticipated as the embassy opened and Trump abandoned America’s claim to honest broker status in the Middle East.

It was the biggest test yet of Ivanka’s ability to cast a benign light on a man who regularly creates a shadow too dark for her to dispel.

Ford Vox: What the $%#@ is wrong with you? Of course it’s Yanny! (or Laurel)

Ford Vox

May 16

But if you’re shocked by the Yanny and Laurel differences in your own household and social networks, by all means use this as a moment to reflect on what else you might perceive differently, in the political messaging swirling around us.

Illusions like this fascinate us because they reveal there is a gap between what we perceive to be true and what actually exists. It’s baked into our biology; we’re equipped with brains that spend far more of their energy and devote far more network activity to processing and changing what we sense. Nothing gets in that isn’t dramatically altered before it reaches our conscious awareness.

All knowledge is a feat of human interpretation. These periodic revelations that we see things differently are one of the all-too-fleeting healthy forces of social media, reminding us that we have to work together if we’re going to get things right.

In a short period, Meghan Markle has ushered in a new sensibility and made the world recalibrate how it thinks about this family we thought we already knew so well.

It was a decision she made with her husband and with the blessing of the members of her new family. And it was powerful.

Hilary George-Parkin: What Kate Spade modeled for young women – and their moms

Hilary George-Parkin Hilary George-Parkin

June 5

There’s a reason Kate Spade’s work appealed just as much to a generation of 12-year-old girls as it did to their moms. At its core, it made the case that femininity, creativity and a sense of playfulness weren’t qualities you needed to give up or hide away in order to be taken seriously in the world – that, in fact, they should be celebrated. It was an idealistic notion, but the woman at the helm, who built what would become a multibillion-dollar brand on boxy handbags and polka-dot prints, was all the proof we needed.

The idea that whimsy should have a place in the workplace, that “sophisticated” doesn’t need to mean “staid,” that prints should be mixed and colors can be clashed, were, in many ways, ahead of their time. In an industry of dark sunglasses and status handbags, she embraced an unapologetically pretty, preppy, East Coast aesthetic, turning it on its head in the process.

S. Nathan Park: US-North Korea friendship would be the perfect bulwark against China

Danielle Cho S. Nathan Park

June 6

In short, North Korea is in serious need of a military and economic counterweight against China – and the United States can serve in that capacity. True, it is distasteful to be friends with a regime responsible for massive human rights violations. Yet pragmatism is a longstanding tradition in US foreign relations. Just consider that Mao Zedong was on the short list of history’s greatest monsters, but Richard Nixon shook his hand.

Pragmatists would look beyond the present conditions and examine how a friendly relationship with North Korea would serve the long-term US national interest. With the rise of China, East Asia is far and away the most important region in the world for the United States. If the United States could count North Korea as a friend, it would be adding a friendly state located at the doorstep of China.

Dean Obeidallah: Why Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant

Dean Obeidallah

June 24

Those shocked by these types of protests simply don’t grasp the level of emotion that many who oppose Trump feel. I hear it nightly on my SiriusXM radio show and see it firsthand on social media. Even Trump, in a rare moment of honesty, told his supporters a few weeks ago that those who oppose him are not just angry, but “really, really angry.” Many view Trump as a true threat to America.

So, it should come as no surprise that some would also look to hold members of Team Trump responsible as well. After all, Trump administration officials who defend Trump’s bigoted policies, his demonization of minority groups and his lies, are complicit. They freely choose to do the work for him and they shouldn’t be shocked if some – not all –Trump opponents lash out at them.

David Axelrod: Annapolis victims worked hard and honorably to serve their community

June 29

No, the shooter apparently wasn’t motivated by politics. But the victims died because the newspaper faithfully discharged its obligation to cover the news. So this slaughter should give us pause to reflect on the essential role of the journalist in our society.

They work hard to get the straight and unvarnished facts to us, to shine a light in dark corners and make sure we know what is going on in our communities, our country and the world.

It is a mission to which they commit themselves, often for little money and sometimes at great risk – even, as we now know, in the newsrooms of local papers.

LZ Granderson: I forgave my father for walking out on me. I hope he forgave me, too

LZ Granderson

July 7

I’ve been poor and rich. I’ve been another face in the crowd and a face on television. Inside a crack house and a guest at the White House. And at each junction of my life, the demons regarding my father followed. They had an open invitation courtesy of the anger I kept in my heart. It wasn’t until my son asked why hasn’t he ever met his grandfather that I realized how foolish I had been.

I wasn’t trying to protect my kid. I was trying to punish an absentee father, losing sight of the fact that forgiveness isn’t for the offender, but for the offended.

I went to the nursing home hoping to jog his memory, like a scene from “The Notebook.” I took my phone out to Facetime, so my son could see and talk to his grandfather for the first time. And I went to the nursing home to say, “I forgive you.”

In short, the World Cup champions remind us all that, in an era of globalization, racial and ethnic diversity represent an enduring strength at all levels of society, ones that build cultural and political bridges within and between countries.

For millions of soccer fans around the world, Africa, in effect, just won the World Cup! This is more than just wishful thinking. The makeup of the French team represents a powerful response against building walls and detention centers to detain and dehumanize immigrant populations.

The global debate over immigration is the human rights issue of our time. How are we to treat the women, men, children and families who risk their lives for opportunities that thrive in Western society?

The meeting in Helsinki, Finland, between two men expert in the art of spectacle intended to intimidate the world, proclaiming that Trump’s reorientation of America away from liberal democracy is in line with the intentions of his counterpart, Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The images tell another story: one that gives credence to the belief that Trump’s allegiance to Putin goes way beyond ideology. We still don’t know the actual reason the summit was held, nor do we know – yet – the nature of the hold Putin has over Trump. Yet photographs suggest this was no meeting of equals but an encounter between a supplicant (Trump) and a master (Putin), starting with Putin arriving late to their public encounter, setting it about 45 minutes back.

Manisha Sinha: What happened the last time a President chose America’s enemies over its friends

Shaowei Wang Manisha Sinha

July 25

Donald Trump likes to compare himself to Andrew Jackson, but the Andrew he really resembles is Andrew Johnson. What they have in common are delusions of personal grandeur and a tainted ascent to the presidency. Trump was elected by a minority of the American electorate, with help from the vagaries of the Electoral College system and from considerable Russian interference.

Johnson became president thanks to an assassin’s bullet. While Johnson immodestly compared himself to Jesus and Moses, Trump claims he is the best at everything, even boasting recently on Twitter that his popularity among Republicans exceeds that of Abraham Lincoln. …

But the resemblance between the two men goes deeper. Johnson’s white supremacist views were blatant and his policies precipitated a constitutional crisis that put the President at loggerheads with Congress and his own party, the Republicans.

To many, that sounded racist. That’s because it is. She isn’t complaining that the country’s getting older or younger, richer or poorer, that we’re having more or fewer children or moving to the suburbs. She’s complaining that people who come to America from other countries – even legally – are making this country unrecognizable to her. Indeed, to “us.”

Who “us” means is also clear: Fox News viewers, who are predominantly 65 and older and white. I know many of those viewers, and I’m sad to say that message probably resonated with a lot of them.

Timothy Stanley: What it tells us that John McCain drank vodka with Hillary Clinton

Timothy Stanley

August 25

John McCain once took on Hillary Clinton in a drinking contest. It was at a restaurant in Estonia in 2004, during a congressional tour. Both politicians managed four shots of vodka; the rules were unclear, but Clinton – McCain’s one-time political rival – was declared the winner, according to the restaurant proprietor (though in her own account, Clinton said they “agreed to withdraw in honorable fashion,” rather than name a winner).

That image sums up the humanity and character of the late Sen. McCain, who will be mourned deeply on both sides of the political aisle. He embodied a more moderate brand of conservatism – one that could separate politics and friendship – that now feels distant and very much missed.

He should have been elected President in 2000, when he ran for the Republican nomination and lost, and if he had made it to the White House, America might have forged a new consensus around a smaller state and a cleaner politics.

Today the country is divided in ways that McCain despaired of. But it should be united in grief for a genuine American hero.

Joshua Geltzer: How to prepare for ex-President Trump

courtesy Joshua Geltzer Joshua Geltzer

August 30

No one knows how Trump will leave the Oval Office. Maybe he’ll resign. Maybe he’ll be impeached. Maybe he’ll be voted out in November 2020 – or maybe he’ll leave at the end of two terms in January 2025.

But however he becomes an ex-president, it’s impossible to imagine Trump following in Richard Nixon’s post-presidency footsteps – ones that literally traversed empty beaches in a solitary existence. Whether Trump leaves of his own accord after eight years or is abruptly cast out by a vote of the Senate or Electoral College, he is not one to go quietly into the night.

Remember: This is the only presidential candidate in recent memory who refused, even when he appeared to be on the brink of losing the election, to commit to accepting the outcome of the vote. In a career that’s careened from real estate to reality TV to politics, there’s been one constant: a thirst for more attention.

Danielle Campoamor: Ariana Grande reminds us women have no safe place in America

Ashley Batz Danielle Campoamor

September 3

After Grande’s performance, the Rev. Charles H. Ellis III wrapped his right arm around Grande, pulled her close to him and touched her breast. He did this on stage, in a church, during a funeral – in front of thousands of attendees. Visibly uncomfortable and tense, Grande forced her way through awkward laughs as to not make a scene at the Queen of Soul’s eight-hour funeral. …

The majority of us have felt what Grande undoubtedly felt on that stage: the undeniable fear that accompanies a violation; the need to keep everyone around you happy while you’re internally screaming; the cultural expectation to keep smiling while your bodily autonomy is wholly dismissed.

To watch it play out at a funeral is not to be shocked by what you’ve witnessed, but to be reminded that women – no matter how powerful or famous – are not granted the same public safety as men.

Like his viewers, I fell in love with Tony. He was a brilliant writer and storyteller, and you saw his toughness and sensed his vulnerability. His team at ZPZ are the most gifted filmmakers I have seen in a long, long time. His shows were brilliantly shot, directed and edited, always. His writing was poetry, although his friends say he denied being a poet.

I can’t begin to tell you how much I appreciate and will miss my small part in this program. And my small connection with one of the most brilliant storytellers of our generation. I will miss his voice. I already miss his voice.

I have no claim to being more distraught over Tony’s passing than any of his fans, and not in the same league as those who knew and worked with him. But like those who did know him well, I am really angry at his loss, and deeply sad. His kind won’t come our way again.

Rebecca Wanzo: These images of women around Kavanaugh evoke a familiar alibi

Joe Angeles/WUSTL Photos/Joe Angeles/WUSTL Photos Rebecca Wanzo

September 26

This choice is an extension of a strategy we have seen even before the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh emerged late in the confirmation process. Kavanaugh stands poised to be the justice who will cement an anti-abortion rights court. With images of him with his wife, daughters, law clerks, and young female basketball players, he is framed as a man who supports women and their futures. (Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations.)

They were front and center in the hearings – a visual counterargument to the idea that women’s lives and bodies are not safe in his hands. Now that some women have accused him of assaulting them, the images are even more important. The happy, shining faces of these teenage girls are meant to inspire trust.

Images sell the idea that these girls have been safe in his hands. How could anyone imagine that this man, trusted and loved, would hurt them? And if he has not hurt them, how could he have hurt any other young woman?

Jennifer Taub: Brett Kavanaugh and I have a lot in common

Ilana Panich-Linsman Jennifer Taub

September 28

We both were raised with conservative politics and attended elite prep schools. We both are religious, with deep faith and a belief in God. We both attended Yale in the mid-1980s. We both, aside from occasional binge drinking, worked hard in school and wrote for the student newspaper. We both studied at Cross Campus Library. We both managed to get into top-tier law schools. He Yale, me Harvard. Although we shared similarities, I do not recall ever meeting him at Yale.

But there is one place where our similarities end, and that has made all the difference in our lives. While Brett Kavanaugh appears to have moved fluidly from his beer-drinking prep school days into his beer-drinking college years, I was not as fortunate.

In early fall of my freshman year at Yale, I was raped by an upperclassman. Until that moment, I had expected to maintain my virginity until I was married, or at least until I fell deeply in love. Some of the details are forever seared into my memory, like they were in Christine Blasey Ford’s.

It was also a laugh that the world – or at least its leaders – had at the expense of President Trump.

Beginning his speech at the United Nations General Assembly this week, Trump didn’t appear to expect the humorous interlude as he launched into a recital of his achievements in office to date.

There was no serious stumble, but a short pause, perhaps taking in what was happening. …

The lesson for UN delegates who may have laughed is this: Hope you don’t get found out.

President Trump likes respect. He won’t forget. And he may get the last laugh.

Earlier this week, Rand was besieged in the airport by activists “getting up in his face,” as you, Sen. Booker, encouraged them to do a few months ago. Preventing someone from moving forward, thrusting your middle finger in their face, screaming vitriol – is this the way to express concern or enact change? Or does it only incite unstable people to violence, making them feel that assaulting a person is somehow politically justifiable?

Sen. Booker, Rand has worked with you to co-sponsor criminal justice reform bills. He respects you, and so do I. I would call on you to retract your statement. I would call on you to condemn violence, the leaking of elected officials’ personal addresses (our address was leaked from a Senate directory given only to senators), and the intimidation and threats that are being hurled at them and their families.

Jeffrey Sachs: Trump’s failure to fight climate change is a crime against humanity

Courtesy Jeffrey Sachs Jeffrey Sachs

October 18

President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity. They are the authors and agents of systematic policies that deny basic human rights to their own citizens and people around the world, including the rights to life, health and property. These politicians have blood on their hands, and the death toll continues to rise.

Trump remains in willful denial of the thousands of deaths caused by his government’s inept, under-funded, and under-motivated response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year. The image that will remain in history is of the President gleefully throwing paper towels for a photo op as the people of Puerto Rico around him suffered and died of neglect. In September, Hurricane Florence claimed at least 48 lives, with more likely to come in its aftermath. Last month, Hurricane Michael claimed at least 32 lives, with more than a thousand people reportedly still missing. The final death toll will likely soar in the months ahead as the residual consequences of the storm become more clear.

October 22

This week, the winners of two high-rolling lottery jackpots may get to live out their own big-spending fantasies. Tuesday’s MegaMillions drawing stands at $1.6 billion and Wednesday’s lesser Powerball is still no snip at $620 million. There isn’t even a promise of alien invasion to cut short the spending window.

But in life, as in fiction, there’s always still a catch. Is an overnight windfall of this magnitude really worth the hassle? Earlier this year, a New Hampshire woman sued for the right to retain anonymity while claiming her Powerball prize of $560 million. Most states still consider the identity of lottery winners a matter of public record.

If that sounds like a price worth paying for a half a billion-life change, bear in mind the number of lottery winners who’ve met grisly ends after the news of their winnings spread.

Tim Naftali: The midterms put our system against the Agitator in Chief

New York University Tim Naftali

October 24

Historically, the balancing against power in Washington has happened despite the fact that too many of us view elections – especially midterms – as spectator sports or don’t care about them at all. How this can be in a country that prides itself on the blessings of liberty is a question for another time. But what if this healthy cycle of rebalancing is broken in 2018 despite two years of Trumpian chaos, disrespect for large swathes of our society and daily contempt for dissent?

With only a matter of days to go, the outcome of the struggle in the current three-person race among center-left anger, Trumpist rage and widespread apathy remains remarkably TBD. If our Agitator in Chief’s 2018 Provocation Tour falls short, Donald J. Trump will be the clear loser and our constitutional system the winner. But if he manages to cheat history, our political system will face its strongest stress test in the modern era.

Van Jones: 16 reasons to be excited about the midterm Rainbow Wave

Van Jones

November 7

In this election, we witnessed the end of two years of one-party rule and the beginning of a new Democratic Party: younger, browner, cooler; with more women, more veterans and the ability to contest and win races from the deep South to the Midwest. … I call this torrent of inclusive populism “The Rainbow Wave.” Here is why I am excited about this peek into the future of our nation and the Democratic Party:

1. Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar, both Democrats, will be the first Muslim women in the House of Representatives.

2. Sharice Davids of Kansas and Deb Haaland of New Mexico, also Democrats, will be the first Native American women in the House of Representatives.

3. Colorado Democrat Jared Polis will be the nation’s first openly gay governor. Sharice Davids, mentioned above, is also part of the LGBT community. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema still stands a chance of being the first openly bisexual senator.

November 19

According to a recent paper, the Earth is caught directly in the crosshairs of a cosmic hurricane. A swarm of nearly 100 stars, accompanied by an even greater amount of dark matter, is aimed directly at our stellar neighborhood and there’s nothing we can do to stop it; in fact, the vanguard is already upon us. This sounds like a perfect summer blockbuster movie, starring The Rock and Chris Pratt, or maybe Scarlett Johansson and Charlize Theron.

Except this is for real. But is it a danger? Well, actually, no. Not at all. But it’s potentially incredibly fascinating, with lots of interesting scientific interconnections.

Marcus Mabry: America faces a crossroads after George H.W. Bush’s death

Marcus Mabry

December 1

Agree or disagree with Bush’s politics, it is his profound decency that is his legacy. Just one example: Read his letter to Bill Clinton after he lost the 1992 election. That dignity and decorum is, perhaps, the greatest difference between Trump and his predecessors.

That decency deficit is what has led a handful of Republicans to repudiate Trump’s politics and tone – and many more did so before he was the party’s nominee.

But today’s Republican Party is the party of Trump, not the party of Bush.

And America is at a crossroads. The suburban vote in the midterm elections suggested that many swing voters reject Trump’s divisiveness. But do they accept the burdens of global leadership that George H.W. Bush embraced?”

Throughout his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, special counsel Robert Mueller has imposed on his team an ironclad rule: Nobody leaks and nobody speaks – out of court, that is. But when it comes to official court filings – indictments, plea agreements, sentencing memos – Mueller has been loquacious and at times downright chatty, disclosing in compelling narrative fashion crucial details about his investigation and giving tantalizing clues about what might happen next.

(CNN) —

I could tell that the walls of the room were originally white, but years of dirty hands, sun and time had made them dull. The yellowish hue from the fluorescent lights hanging above didn’t help. Thankfully, the generic floral pictures hanging near the man sitting on the edge of the bed provided some semblance of joy. Nothing else in the room did – especially me.

LZ Granderson

I was in a nursing home.

The man sitting on the edge of the bed was my father.

And this would be the last day I would see him alive.

In healthy father-son relationships, when the parent dies the child mourns. But considering that more than 20 years had passed since my father and I had seen each other, you could say we didn’t have a healthy relationship.

When I was in elementary school he would occasionally pick me up on the weekends and we’d watch the Detroit Tigers on the television in his kitchen. I once spent an entire summer with him watching baseball and learning how to fish. Then one day, without explanation, he stopped coming around.

I once ran away from my mother’s home, showed up at his place begging for him to take me in, and he drove me back without hesitation. More than five years would go by before I would see him again. Another three after that. Then finally some 20-odd years later in a dingy room of a nursing home in a suburb of Detroit.

I used to say that 23 chromosomes and disappointment were the only things my father contributed to my life. It was my way of laughing through pain I couldn’t acknowledge.

Over time the desperation to be a part of his life turned into resentment and anger over him not wanting to be a part of mine. When my mother told me a couple of years ago that he had Alzheimer’s disease I coldly replied: “He didn’t know me before; what does it matter if he doesn’t recognize me now?”

I’m aware such an admission reflects poorly on me. But I don’t write this to make myself look good. I don’t pretend I’ve evolved or that I have all the answers. I write because we all have our struggles.

I’ve been poor and rich. I’ve been another face in the crowd and a face on television. Inside a crack house and a guest at the White House. And at each junction of my life, the demons regarding my father followed. They had an open invitation courtesy of the anger I kept in my heart. It wasn’t until my son asked why hasn’t he ever met his grandfather that I realized how foolish I had been.

I wasn’t trying to protect my kid. I was trying to punish an absentee father, losing sight of the fact that forgiveness isn’t for the offender, but for the offended.

I went to the nursing home hoping to jog his memory, like a scene from “The Notebook.” I took my phone out to Facetime, so my son could see and talk to his grandfather for the first time. And I went to the nursing home to say “I forgive you.”

But the disease had progressed too far. He smiled but he didn’t know who I was. My son was happy to see his grandfather’s face, but no conversation ensued. My father was incapable of comprehending what was being said or forming sentences of his own. I looked him in the eyes and told him “I forgive you,” but if he understood, he didn’t show it.

In March I learned that my father died. I didn’t cry. Instead, I mourned the fact I didn’t care enough about him to cry. I thought about all the time I let slip by because I wanted to show everyone how strong I was. I thought about the memories I had robbed from my son. And I thought: You don’t always know what people are going through when they hurt the ones they love, and you may never find out if you don’t have enough forgiveness in your heart to ask.

I went to the nursing home that day because I was finally ready to ask. The reward for my foolish pride is spending the rest of my life without an answer.

On Father’s Day this year I woke up to several text messages from well-wishers. Some friends gave me a card raving about what a great dad I am. My son sent his love. I checked baseball scores to see if the Tigers won the night before. They did, 7-5 over the Chicago White Sox.

I closed my eyes and I could see a little boy watching the Tigers with his dad in the kitchen. I saw them fishing. Talking. I guess he did have a positive impact on my life after all. I opened my eyes, stared at the bright white ceiling in my room and finally allowed the tears for my father to fall, whispering – “I hope you found it in your heart to forgive me too.”",2018-07-07 00:00:00
I was Anthony Bourdain's 'censor' at CNN (opinion),"Editor’s Note: Marianna Spicer Joslyn is executive director of News Standards and Practices at CNN. Prior to her 24 years at CNN, she was executive producer of CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” producer of ABC News’ “This Week With David Brinkley,” “World News Saturday and Sunday,” and “The Health Show,” and an associate producer and writer for CBS’$2 60 Minutes” and “CBS Reports.” The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) —

I was Anthony Bourdain’s “censor” at CNN.

No, we don’t really have “censors,” per se, at CNN – we have Standards and Practices. I was the lucky one in our department to review “Parts Unknown” for things like graphic language or pictures, political bent or historical tweaking.

I never met him. I never even spoke to him. I didn’t have to. He spoke to me, and everyone else, through his work.

As a former documentarian, I especially appreciated the sheer beauty of his programs, and the talents of his team. I was blown away by the photography, the direction, the editing and, of course, the writing.

As many have remarked, Bourdain had a very distinctive voice. As a writer for “60 Minutes,” I did preliminary scripts for the likes of Mike Wallace, Ed Bradley and Diane Sawyer. I tried to hear their voices in my head as I wrote those initial tracks. I don’t think I could have done that for Anthony Bourdain. His voice was too personal … so visceral. I didn’t know how he felt about what he was experiencing. Only he could tell us.

Tony – and I think of him that way rather than by his formal name – spoke plainly. Writers like him don’t write to impress, they don’t try to write poetry, and they don’t even think about the impact their words will have. They write to share their experience as they are experiencing it – not as a travelogue, but more trying to put you there with them. They can tell us what they see and hear and smell and taste and in a way that is organic.

For someone used to dealing with what news standards should be for our network, trying to find the “bar” for “Parts Unknown” was its own journey.

It’s well known that Tony was profane. This was something new for CNN. We had hired him wanting him and everything that went along with it. But even though CNN is cable, it is also a brand. It’s the most widely respected news network in the world, our viewers tell us, and we really don’t want profane vernacular coming out of our anchors’ mouths.

But we hired Tony to be Tony. Dilemma. So someone came up with the arbitrary “two shits per show.” F-words were verboten and muted, although of course you could see what was being said. Tony joked about the “two shits” rule on late night TV and said he was negotiating for three for the next season.

I have to say, I eventually gave up on the “shits.” But those weren’t the biggest problem.

Tony loved talking about genitals. Mostly his. “Be careful after eating spicy foods to wash your hands before relieving yourself” was his favorite. Various bugs and reptiles climbing up his pants and endangering the jewels was another. Then there was the show where people were leaping in ponds and having to spend the rest of the day with “moist nuts.”

Whenever the opportunity presented itself, Tony made sure you knew how his body functions were impacted. On a trip to the French Alps with his good buddy and fellow chef Eric Ripert, where both of them ate copious amounts of cheese fondue, Tony warned Eric that he would be having large, concrete-like bowel movements.

I learned that “crap” and “shit” were different. Who knew?

For one of the last episodes, about the Lower East Side of New York, I paid no attention to the “shits” uttered by Tony and his various guests. The multiple f-words, uttered equally by Tony and his dinner companions, would be muted.

But in this episode, Tony’s guests were, hard to believe, more profane than he was. They told tales of 60’s NYC and the very gritty art and music scene. A lunch companion, guest/singer/performer Lydia Lunch, spoke plainly about what it took to make it in the 60’s – hand jobs under the table to get her band to Europe. And that’s one of her milder utterances. And millennials think they invented shock value. Let’s just say “let it all hang out” wasn’t a metaphor.

The producers at Zero Point Zero and I had many discussions over the dispatching of animals. I’ve since read what Tony wrote about that, and I wished I’d read it before. He was on the record as saying after he killed his first pig with a spear, which he felt obligated to do, having ordered the execution of many, many animals as a chef, he felt it was hypocritical not to show where our food comes from.

Again, cable is not necessarily cable news. I am an animal lover and admittedly in denial about continuing to eat meat while I can’t stand the thought, let alone the sight, of killing animals. I didn’t feel our audience was ready for Tony’s level of reality. I challenged his executive producer with the question, “Would Tony want to bring a cow out to his dinner guests to see its butchering?” We compromised, but not much.

Of course, Tony was very, very funny. We had to seek a middle ground in many areas, especially politics. In one episode, Tony described a particularly disgusting-sounding food he tried somewhere in Africa as being so good he would “eat it out of Chris Christie’s jock on a hot summer day.” Besides the fact that, at the time, Christie was a sitting governor and a presidential candidate, there was the TMI factor. Then the “fat joke” factor. I have the fortunate alternative of kicking these decisions to the next level. It passed, under the “let Tony be Tony” rule.

Tony seemed to love all things shocking, not really a surprise given his personal journey, because after all, what was really shocking to him? In an episode on Tokyo, he reveled in following a couple who “taught” bondage. There were many extended scenes of “fun with ropes” that rubbed my bosses the wrong way – if you’ll forgive the pun – but Tony loved it.

My responsibilities included looking at several cuts of each program – rough cut, fine cut, picture lock. I actually needed to look at all the cuts because I was convinced Tony (or maybe his producers?) loved playing the game of “what else can I sneak in here that standards might miss on the second cut.” Blurs needed to be checked and rechecked. Was there anything new? I’m sure I was just paranoid … maybe.

One of my favorite challenges over the past five years was an episode on Chicago, where Tony visited a bar whose owner was also a painter. His work was primarily of political icons. One such painting was of Sarah Palin, naked, holding a shotgun, with a turkey being dispatched behind her. Uh. No. Please cover the vice presidential candidate’s private parts. Made me think the show might be called “Private Parts Unknown.”

Like his viewers, I fell in love with Tony. He was a brilliant writer and storyteller, and you saw his toughness and sensed his vulnerability. His team at ZPZ are the most gifted filmmakers I have seen in a long, long time. His shows were brilliantly shot, directed and edited, always. His writing was poetry, although his friends say he denied being a poet.

I can’t begin to tell you how much I appreciate and will miss my small part in this program. And my small connection with one of the most brilliant storytellers of our generation. I will miss his voice. I already miss his voice.

I have no claim to being more distraught over Tony’s passing than any of his fans, and not in the same league as those who knew and worked with him. But like those who did know him well, I am really angry at his loss, and deeply sad. His kind won’t come our way again.",2018-09-22 00:00:00

(CNN) —

President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity. They are the authors and agents of systematic policies that deny basic human rights to their own citizens and people around the world, including the rights to life, health, and property. These politicians have blood on their hands, and the death toll continues to rise.

Trump remains in willful denial of the thousands of deaths caused by his government’s inept, under-funded, and under-motivated response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. The image that will remain in history is of the President gleefully throwing paper towels for a photo op as the people of Puerto Rico around him suffered and died of neglect. Last September, 2018 Hurricane Florence claimed at least 48 lives, with more likely to come in its aftermath. Soon after, Hurricane Michael claimed at least 32 lives, with more than a thousand people reportedly still missing. The final death toll will likely soar in the months ahead as the residual consequences of the storm become more clear.

As the Earth warms due to the continued burning of coal, oil, and gas, climate-related disasters that include high-intensity hurricanes, floods, droughts, extreme precipitation, forest fires, and heat waves, pose rising dangers to life and property. Hurricanes become more destructive as warmer ocean waters feed more energy to the storms. Warmer air also carries more moisture for devastating rainfalls, while rising sea levels lead to more flooding.

Yet Trump and his minions are the loyal servants of the fossil-fuel industry, which fill Republican party campaign coffers. Trump has also stalled the fight against climate change by pulling out of the Paris Agreement. The politicians thereby deprive the people of their lives and property out of profound cynicism, greed, and willful scientific ignorance.

The first job of government is to protect the public. Real protection requires climate action on several fronts: educating the public about the growing dire risks of human-induced climate change; enacting legislation and regulations to ensure that families and businesses are kept out of harm’s way, for example by stopping construction in flood plains, and investing in sustainable infrastructure to counteract rising sea levels; anticipating the rising frequency of high-intensity climate-related disasters through science-based preparedness following through on properly scaled disaster-response during and after storm events; and most importantly for the future, spearheading the rapid transition to zero-carbon energy to prevent much greater calamities in the years ahead.

This straightforward to-do list is the opposite of what Trump and his cronies are doing. Trump blithely disregards scientific findings about climate change and thereby exposes the nation to unprecedented risks. The officials he has appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant parts of government are industry cronies and lobbyists far more interested in self-enrichment, padding their accounts, and helping their once-and-future employers than in doing their current jobs.

Trump’s mishandling of Puerto Rico disaster in the wake of Hurricane Maria is grounds itself for impeachment and trial. Thousands of citizens died unnecessarily on Trump’s watch because the administration could not be stirred to proper action before, during, and after the hurricane.

Two independent, detailed epidemiological studies, using different methodologies – one led by researchers at Harvard University and the other by researchers at George Washington University – have estimated that thousands died in the aftermath of Maria.

While dozens died during the storm, thousands more died as a result of the residual effects of the storm. Maria downed electricity and wreaked havoc on the ability of Puerto Ricans to meet their life-sustaining needs by disrupting access to health services, safe water, and transportation. They died, in short, from the storm, and ultimately from inadequate disaster prevention, preparedness and response.

Yet when the George Washington University study was released in September, 2018, the President responded by saying, “I think we did a fantastic job” in Puerto Rico. He brazenly denied the death count, without any attempt whatsoever to understand or learn from the findings.

Recent scientific studies underscore the dire emergency ahead. Professor James Hansen, one of the world’s leading climatologists, has demonstrated that the Earth’s climate has moved above the temperature range that supported the entire 10,000 years of civilization. The risks of catastrophic sea level rise are upon us.

A group of world-leading ecologists recently highlighted that critical Earth systems could spiral out of control. The Nobel-prize winning Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change released a harrowing report showing that the world has just a few years left to move decisively towards renewable energy if it hopes to achieve the globally agreed target to limit warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average temperature of the planet.

Simone Biles: I went from foster care to the Olympics(Opinion),"Editor’s Note: Simone Biles is a four-time Olympic gold medalist in gymnastics. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) —

People love to ask: “What’s your secret?” Sometimes they want to know how I defy gravity on the mat. Other times they want to know how I went from foster care to the Olympics.

My answer to both is the same: a mix of talent, hard work and grabbing the right opportunity when given the chance. When I was far too young to know it, others around me saw that I had a gift for gymnastics. Without their encouragement and support, I would have never been a gymnast.

I was blessed to have both a gift and the chance to develop it. But many people aren’t so lucky.

Megan Battle Schoenberg Simone Biles

Did you know that in the United States there are nearly 400,000 children and youth in foster care? In my mind, those are 400,000 talents waiting to be discovered. But as few as 3% of foster kids go on to earn a bachelor’s degree, compared to about 30% of the general population.

Is it possible that all of these young people have no desire to go on to higher education? Clearly not. They simply lack the support, and often the financial resources and opportunity to realize their potential.

So, I’m speaking up on their behalf to say it’s time for an education revolution. It’s time for a new model, where everyone has an opportunity to learn no matter their background.

And I want to advocate for these kids because I was a foster care kid myself. My road to success began the day my grandfather and his wife officially adopted my sister and me. My birth mother suffered from drug addiction, and when I was just three years old, my siblings and I were removed from her custody. From there, we bounced around until I was six and my grandparents made the brave move to adopt us.

Although I was young when my foster care ordeal began, I remember how it felt to be passed off and over-looked. Like nobody knew me or wanted to know me. Like my talents didn’t count, and my voice didn’t matter.

Finding a family made me feel like I mattered. Finding a passion, something I loved and was really good at, made me feel like I mattered. Representing my country and being part of such an amazing Olympic team matters, as does being a role model for those looking to fulfill their own dreams.

Which brings me to the issue of education. There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that children and youth in foster care are a vulnerable population in the education system. Across the United States, 52% of foster youth attend schools that rank in the lowest 30%. Worse yet, nearly a quarter of foster youth struggle with learning disabilities in the school system.

And that’s saying nothing of the academic and emotional challenges that accompany multiple family and school placements over the course of childhood.

But if we invest in foster care children, they, too, can have the opportunity to succeed – which in turn strengthens our communities, economy and society. And one area of investment that I’m particularly concerned with is college.

I always dreamed of going to college. I had planned to go the University of California Los Angeles, but I deferred and continued training at my home gym.

However, I wasn’t satisfied with my deferral. I wanted to find a way to pursue my studies while still training for the next Olympic Games, and that’s why I enrolled at University of the People, a non-profit, tuition-free online university that is opening access to higher education for students around the world.

The online university format gives me a uniquely flexible opportunity to fit college around my career in a way that didn’t otherwise exist. And it isn’t just a great solution for competitive athletes. It’s an opportunity for anyone who feels that the financial, structural or personal barriers to college are too high for them to overcome.

Knowing what it means to have the odds stacked against you, I believe it is my duty to provide assistance to those most in need. For this reason, I am launching a scholarship fund at UoPeople for foster kids and others. This fund will assist with covering the costs associated with earning their degrees – including application fees and assessments fees at the end of each course.

Our circumstances shouldn’t define us or keep us from our goals, especially if that goal is higher education. My hope is that I can help other foster care children realize that goal in the months and years ahead.",2018-02-05 00:00:00
A dark matter hurricane is headed our way (opinion),"(CNN) —

According to a recent paper, the Earth is caught directly in the crosshairs of a cosmic hurricane. A swarm of nearly 100 stars, accompanied by an even greater amount of dark matter, is aimed directly at our stellar neighborhood and there’s nothing we can do to stop it; in fact, the vanguard is already upon us.

Except this is for real. But is it a danger? Well, actually, no. Not at all. But it’s potentially incredibly fascinating, with lots of interesting scientific interconnections. So, what is really going on?

The story starts last April, when the Gaia satellite announced the locations and trajectories of 2 billion stars in the vicinity of the Milky Way surrounding our sun. They released the data to the public.

Scientists were then able to look at the data set to see if they could spot anything peculiar. In galaxies like the Milky Way, the most common behavior is that the stars orbit the center of the galaxy in a manner broadly similar to the planets orbiting our sun. However, there are some stars that exhibit unusual motion. About a year ago, astronomers identified some “stellar streams” passing through our celestial neighborhood.

One of them, called S1 (for stream 1), consists of nearly 100 stars of similar age and composition, orbiting the Milky Way in a direction exactly opposite that of normal stars. It’s kind of like a handful of cars driving the wrong way down the highway, except with a much greater distance between them and with no likelihood of a collision. These stars are spread out over a few thousand light years and they will pass through the solar system’s neighborhood over the course of a few million years.

Astronomers identified S1 as being part of the remnants of a dwarf galaxy that collided with the Milky Way and was consumed in an epic episode of cosmic cannibalism. Dwarf galaxies are very small, typically about 1% the mass of the Milky Way. They can orbit larger galaxies and collide with the bigger galaxy, adding their mass to the parent. This is what appears to have happened in the case of S1, although the process has taken probably a billion years.

Dwarf galaxies often have a disproportionately large fraction of dark matter. Dark matter is a hypothetical and still-undiscovered form of matter that interacts only gravitationally. Scientists have proposed its existence to explain many astronomical mysteries, for example the observation that most galaxies rotate faster than can be explained by the known laws of physics and the stars and gas of which they are composed.

While dark matter has not yet been observed, hypothesizing its existence is the simplest and most economical explanation for myriad astronomical mysteries. Averaged over the entire universe, dark matter is thought to be five times more prevalent than the ordinary mass of stars and gas and planets.

In dwarf galaxies, the fraction of dark matter is often higher. In Fornax, a well-studied dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, researchers estimate that the dark matter is between 10 and 100 times greater than the mass found in its stars.

If that number holds for S1, the dark matter of the S1 stream is passing through the Earth at a much higher velocity than the more ordinary dark matter that orbits the Milky Way – about twice as fast. It is thought that S1 dark matter is flying through the solar system at a speed of about 550 km/s, or about 1.2 million mph. While these numbers are impressive, they are misleading. Dark matter, if it exists, is extremely diffuse and it will have no discernible effect on the solar system.

Because dark matter hasn’t been observed yet, these velocity numbers are speculative, although they are strongly supported by a very large body of evidence. However, the prospect of high velocity dark matter flying through the Earth has suggested an opportunity to detect it.

In a paper in the prestigious journal Physical Review D, researcher Ciaran O’Hare and his collaborators calculated the possibilities of discovering dark matter using both existing and proposed dark matter detectors. They considered two varieties of dark matter particles: a very heavy kind called a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle) and a very light kind called an axion. Because the ultimate nature of dark matter is not known, it is important to be open to all possibilities.

They found that the detectors they evaluated could find WIMPs for certain ranges of the particle mass. However, when they looked at the axion possibility, it appeared the prospects were even better. Because of its light mass and the manner in which an axion would interact with the detector, the apparatus simply has a better chance of seeing the axion. (If axions exist, of course.)

Experiments with names like ADMX, MADMAX and ABRACADABRA are able or will be able to search for the signatures of dark matter proposed in the recent paper. They consist of technologies that are designed to interact with axions in a strong magnetic field and convert them to ordinary microwaves or radio waves that can be easily detected.

It’s important to remember that the S1 stream poses no credible threat to the Earth and humanity. There is no need for an action hero to save us. However, the synergy of science is staggering. A careful catalog of nearby stars has opened the prospect of a better possibility of finding and identifying dark matter, which is one of the great unanswered mysteries of modern physics. It’s an amazing time we live in, in which we can study such things.

There’s a line in the hit 1988 film “Heathers” – now running as a musical in London’s West End – when the clique of popular girls takes an inane straw poll of their high school cafeteria. “You inherit $5 million the same day aliens land on the Earth and say they’re going to blow it up in two days. What do you do?” The answers are as diffuse as they are wild: vows of selfless charity, fantasies of luring Madonna into prostitution, designs for suicide-bombing zoos “so you and the lion die like one.”

This week, the winners of two high-rolling lottery jackpots may get to live out their own big-spending fantasies. Tuesday’s MegaMillions drawing currently stands at $1.6 billion and Wednesday’s lesser Powerball is still no snip at $620 million. There isn’t even a promise of alien invasion to cut short the spending window.

But in life, as in fiction, there’s always still a catch. Is an overnight windfall of this magnitude really worth the hassle? Earlier this year, a New Hampshire woman sued for the right to retain anonymity while claiming her Powerball prize of $560 million. Most states still consider the identity of lottery winners a matter of public record.

If that sounds like a price worth paying for a half a billion life change, bear in mind the number of lottery winners who’ve met grisly ends after the news of their winnings spread.

In 2006, Abraham Shakespeare won $30 million in Florida; less than three years later, he was found buried under a concrete slab. Doris “Dee Dee” Moore, a woman who mysteriously befriended Shakespeare after his win, was eventually convicted of his murder. She’d offered to help Shakespeare manage his winnings, and killed him for them instead.

Shakespeare isn’t the only winner who’s been killed after becoming a high-profile target. In November 2015, Craigory Burch Jr. won $400,000 in Illinois and posed with the check. Two months later, he was killed in a targeted home invasion by gunmen demanding his money.

This is, of course, old wisdom. Chaucer’s medieval “Pardoner’s Tale” tells the story of three arrogant brothers eager to seek out and destroy Death. When they meet a wizened old man on their journey, so the tale goes, he directs them “to find Death, turn up this crooked way” and points them to a glistening casket of gold buried in the roots of the tree. It only takes this sudden windfall to ensure all three of the brothers kill each other.

Six-hundred years later, J.K. Rowling adapts the tale in the Harry Potter books to tell the story of “the Elder Wand.” In this version, Death gifts the eldest of the three brothers an all-powerful magic wand – but it can’t protect him in his sleep. Excited by his new power, he gets drunk in a nearby inn and boasts of his good luck, whereupon he promptly has his throat cut in his drunken sleep by a fellow patron. (“And so Death took the first brother for his own.”) Folk knowledge through the ages has warned us: Too much sudden gold or power, and you attract the wrong type of envy.

Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images A woman fills out a Mega Millions lottery ticket on October 19, 2018 in New York City.

Still, who doesn’t want to win the lottery? Just keep your mouth shut, do your best to claim anonymity (easier in some states than other) and don’t flash your cash, right?

If only it were that simple. Even if you can keep out of the limelight, it’s hard to adapt to sudden wealth when you’re not used to it. Drug addiction has plagued lottery winners. Jack Whittaker, who won the Powerball in 2002, lost his daughter and granddaughter to drugs and blamed their sudden wealth for fueling their spending on drugs. (“My granddaughter is dead because of the money,” Whittaker said in 2007. “You know, my wife said she wished that she had torn the ticket up. Well, I wish that we tore the ticket up, too.”)

Even those born into wealthy families, whose relatives have every opportunity to teach them how to manage money, often screw it up. The last Duke of Marlborough had to put Blenheim Palace, one of Britain’s largest stately homes and birthplace of Winston Churchill, into a trust to avoid his ex-convict son from taking control of it. In 1999, citing the Marlborough case, the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland went to court to delay the receipt of an inheritance by their son George, who was 14 years old at the time.

“Too much too young,” they argued, would leave him vulnerable to “vices and pitfalls.” George Percy has since forged his own career in geothermal energy and will still inherit Alnwick Castle on his parents’ death.

But the concerns of parents like the Northumberlands have fueled the rise of “Next Generation” programs in private banks, which specialize in teaching the young how to manage their money sensibly. If you do win this week’s Powerball, the best thing you can probably do is sign up to spend a week alongside the world’s young aristocrats and oil heirs.

It’s sad but true: The best answer given to a fantasy wealth questionnaire in popular culture isn’t the hedonism of “Heathers,” but the vow of Ross Geller in “Friends” as he snatches a lottery ticket from his friends in season 9: “I’m going to put it all into a very low-yield bond!”

Given that winning $1.6 billion seems like so much trouble, you might consider passing altogether on this week’s game of chance. If these horror stories of a “lottery” curse don’t put you off, consider the old moral arguments: Lottery tickets are primarily bought in poor neighborhoods, by people who can’t afford to throw their money away. Even if your Powerball purchase this week is a one-off flutter, you’re still fueling an industry powered by perpetuating gambling addictions.

But if you’ve really got to play this week, enjoy the thrill. Just cross your fingers, count your lucky stars and pray that you don’t win.",2018-10-22 00:00:00

Anyone who needs confirmation of the secret of a strongman – that he’s a weak man, in constant need of ego affirmation – need only look at images of the Helsinki “summit” between American President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which revealed the insecurities of both men underneath the façade of power, and Trump’s submissiveness to Putin in particular.

CNN Ruth Ben-Ghiat

Here is a selection of those images captured by photo journalists. Of course, they don’t convey every moment of the meeting, but they are consistent with what we saw on air during their appearances together. There are many other such similar images – each seemingly more awkward than the last – in which the subjects tell more of a story than they may have wanted through physical cues.

The meeting in Helsinki between two men expert in the art of spectacle intended to intimidate the world, proclaiming that Trump’s reorientation of America away from liberal democracy is in line with the intentions of his counterpart Putin.

The images tell another story: one that gives credence to the belief that Trump’s allegiance to Putin goes way beyond ideology. We still don’t know the actual reason the summit was held, nor do we know – yet - the nature of the hold Putin has over Trump. Yet photographs suggest that this was no meeting of equals but an encounter between a supplicant (Trump) and a master (Putin), starting with Putin arriving late to their public encounter, setting it about 45 minutes back.

At the same time, Putin, who is used to absolute control, had some discomfort at having their relationship scrutinized by the world’s press. He indicated this with small gestures that told a story when captured by photographers.

Trump is known for his expansive body language and his flamboyant use of hand gestures in particular: he’s used to using his large frame to advantage and dominating any space he’s in. In images of him seated with Putin and together at the podium, though, Trump seems to want to appear smaller out of a very uncharacteristic desire not to overshadow his interlocutor.

Whatever their momentary alliances, strongmen know only one mode: competition. Putin reportedly had his new limousine – slightly larger than Trump’s – brought over for the occasion. Both men are performers, too, with years of practice in honing personas built on equal parts of charm and threat. Yet neither was able to hide that this summit was far from ordinary head-of-state business. Thanks to Robert Mueller’s investigation, one day soon we may come to know why that is.

AWKWARD STRONGMEN

Trump shows Putin respect by containing his physical presence inward, a pose he commonly adopts when meeting with the press and dignitaries: here he sits with shoulders hunched, hands rigorously together, eyes downcast. Putin alternated between trying to look relaxed and even bored at Trump’s flattery; but his hand gripping the armrest in an awkward way tells us that this is not an easy moment for him either.

(CNN) —

Someday, Donald Trump will become ex-President Trump. After a guilty plea from his longtime “fixer,” Michael Cohen, alleging that Trump directed the commission of federal crimes, perhaps that day will arrive sooner rather than later. But whether it’s a week, 18 months or more than six years away, we need to start preparing now. That’s because, for all of the threat to our democracy Trump poses as president, he may pose an even bigger one as an ex-president.

No one knows how Trump will leave the Oval Office. Maybe he’ll resign. Maybe he’ll be impeached. Maybe he’ll be voted out in November 2020 – or maybe he’ll leave at the end of two terms in January 2025.

But, however he becomes an ex-president, it’s impossible to imagine Trump following in Richard Nixon’s post-presidency footsteps – ones that literally traversed empty beaches in a solitary existence. Whether Trump leaves of his own accord after eight years or is abruptly cast out by a vote of the Senate or Electoral College, he is not one to go quietly into the night.

Remember: This is the only presidential candidate in recent memory who refused, even when he appeared to be on the brink of losing the election, to commit to accepting the outcome of the vote. In a career that’s careened from real estate to reality TV to politics, there’s been one constant: a thirst for more attention.

So imagine ex-President Trump tweeting out real-time commentary on every move his successor makes. Imagine him continuing to fire up crowds at the campaign-style rallies he hasn’t stopped doing even as a sitting president. Imagine him starting his own news media empire – just as he apparently planned to do if he lost in 2016. He will be loud.

And he will be dangerous. Already, Trump is casting doubt on the validity of the upcoming midterm elections, suggesting that Moscow is intervening to favor the Democrats and predicting violence if Democrats reverse Republican gains. Already, Trump is indulging the voices of white supremacism and paranoia, finding moral equivalence “on both sides” in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, and criticizing tech companies for removing the hate-filled conspiracy theories of Alex Jones and his Infowars. Already, Trump is baselessly attacking other presidents, accusing Barack Obama of surveilling him and planting a spy in his campaign.

Now imagine what Trump will be without White House advisers surrounding him and at least trying to rein him in. Imagine how he might cast doubt on election results, especially ones that have landed him out of office. Imagine how he might seek to rally support wherever he can find it, even among the most extreme voices in our society. Imagine what he might accuse a successor of doing – especially one who’s just beaten him – given what Trump has said about a predecessor against whom he didn’t even run and who went out of his way to be cordial in the transition between them.

And think about Trump’s supporters. For many who felt that they didn’t have a voice in Washington, Trump was, at last, that voice. They won’t want that voice to go silent. That’s particularly true if they feel that, just as Trump told them, the system proves “rigged.” They’ll surely feel that way if Trump’s impeached or effectively forced to resign. But, even if he’s voted out – or even if he serves for eight years but claims to have been hamstrung for much of it by a purported “witch hunt” led by special counsel Robert Mueller – Trump’s supporters will feel that they and he never really got a fair shake. And, as he always does, Trump will indulge that view – indeed, he’ll stoke it.

Our nation’s thought leaders need to develop and agree to principles now to mitigate the looming threat posed by ex-President Trump. One might apply to the next president, whether Democratic or Republican: Simply do not engage with ex-President Trump, no matter how vicious his attacks become; isolate him by ignoring him.

Another might govern both sides of the aisle in Congress: Speak up loudly for the norm of ex-presidents treating their successors – and the office itself – with respect, even if they disagree with particular policies. And a third might guide the media: Make a pact (whether or not the likes of Breitbart and Fox News agree to it) not to give ex-President Trump more than perfunctory coverage, whatever invective he hurls and however the public remains fascinated by his norm-shattering behavior.

From the White House to the Capitol to the media, the dangers posed by ex-President Trump put a premium on electing leaders and supporting commentators who can make a compelling – even passionate – case for why fundamental norms of American governance and political dialogue need to be restored and protected.

There will, of course, be more to Trump’s post-presidency than the man himself: He has introduced ideas that will not simply vanish when he leaves the White House. Some of those ideas concern how presidents (and even presidential candidates) communicate, such as by interrupting and talking over debate opponents as well as by using language – like Trump’s reference to “s**thole countries” – previously unacceptable in mainstream politics or even society.

Some of those ideas relate to particular policies, from Trump’s brand of economic nationalism to his insistence that immigration is predominantly a liability for the United States, its security and its identity. No matter how Trump leaves office, those ideas have now been normalized in ways that defy instant reversal. They will need to be addressed by deliberate norm-restoring behavior by future presidents and by the articulation of superior policies by politicians able to make those policies resonate with the public.

Whatever traction Trump’s ideas have, Trump himself will surely cling to the spotlight – if he can. We were, as a nation, largely blindsided by the assault on longstanding norms that Trump has personified. That’s allowed a lot of damage to be done that we’ll spend decades repairing. We can’t afford to be blindsided, yet again, by the potential for ex-President Trump to shatter more norms and continue to shake the foundations of our democracy. That’s what those ousted from power do in banana republics. Let’s get the principles in place to ensure it doesn’t happen here.",2018-08-30 00:00:00

(CNN) —

After the two had had their say, the millions had theirs. A wrenching day of testimony by Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over her claim that he had once sexually assaulted her (which he denies) set off a global torrent of reaction. It would continue even after a stunning twist Friday stalled what had seemed a march to confirmation.

By then, on social media, stories from women had piled up behind a heartbreaking hashtag, #whyIdidntreport, which became a spontaneous national repository of revelation and regret.

Recounting her own rape, Jennifer Taub wrote that “watching Thursday’s hearing reopened so much of that trauma,” and suggested what might help to heal her. And in the New York Times, Padma Lakshmi wrote about the years it took her to talk about her rape at 16, warning “we all have a lot to lose if we put a time limit on telling the truth about sexual assault.”

Meanwhile, pundits, politicians and regular citizens tore into a “broken” confirmation process that recalled the Anita Hill case and had turned into a “partisan circus.” Julian Zelizer summoned Hill’s ordeal to argue that the nickel never dropped for the GOP. The “joke” of the Senate’s investigation of the Kavanaugh case, he said, reveals a nation whose “politics are in a worse place than they were 27 years ago.”

And on Thursday evening the white Republican men who control the Senate Judiciary Committee delivered their verdict: a vote to forward Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate. While no surprise, this was for many women (and men) another patriarchal punch in the gut. For others? A vindication.

Then two women cornered swing vote Jeff Flake on an elevator, delivered their own stories of assault, and by the end of Friday President Donald Trump had ordered a weeklong FBI probe of his nominee—a pause, that David Gergen had suggested about 12 hours earlier “to allow senators to hear the public’s voice.”

Flake’s belated attempt to put the brakes on Kavanaugh’s confirmation drew only a half-hearted cheer from Noah Berlatsky, who said it was only “the bare minimum to even approach decency.” Still, it’s not nothing, he wrote: “Dissension among Republicans in power can signal GOP partisans that it’s okay to take positions against Trump or against McConnell.”

Did we mention that Bill Cosby was sentenced to prison this week for sexual assault?

We can’t remember when our contributors had so much to say.

More than he-said, she-said

San Diego Union-Tribune/ ZUMA Wire © San Diego Union-Tribune/ ZUMA Wire

Frida Ghitis saw a dire signal from Republicans after Christine Blasey Ford’s riveting, credible testimony. In the midst of #MeToo, she said, the party is “actively standing against efforts to repair one of the longstanding injustices in society: the attitude that allows men to exploit and abuse women.”

Former prosecutor Paul Callan filed a dissenting view: “Blasey Ford made a very good initial impression,” he said, but “the troubling gaps in her story” would not have convinced a trial jury. Alice Stewart sympathized with Kavanaugh: “No one’s good name and reputation should be ruined for the sake of political gain.”

But if Blasey Ford’s “testimony is not believed, it is difficult to imagine an accuser whose would be,” wrote Deborah Tuerkheimer. “Where she was controlled, he was enraged. Where she seemed objective, he seemed partisan. Where she was helpful, he was nonresponsive and unwilling to answer straightforward questions. On several occasions, he was belligerent.” (It helped that she knew from her hippocampus, wrote Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky, bolstering her explanation of why her memory of the alleged attack was detailed in some places but not in others.)

And Carol Costello wrote that Blasey Ford’s testimony signaled that the days of he-said-who-cares-what-she-said are over for good.

Defense attorney Page Pate said Blasey Ford “nailed it,” which was why it was such a bad look for the committee’s Republicans to have their chosen prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, suddenly stop her questioning of the sobbing nominee. They dropped her “like a hot potato when it came time to really confront Judge Kavanaugh about these allegations.”

Kavanaugh’s repeated crying as he defended himself before senators, wrote Michael D’Antonio, showed the “wider latitude” for emoting that men in politics have today (he noted that a woman acting the same way would have been called “hysterical.”) Kavanaugh had a right to despair, observed Scott Jennings, and “deserves credit for fighting like hell to defend his honor, his reputation and the family name carried by his wife and daughters.”

His emotional turn was a far cry from the placid jurist the nation saw earlier in the week in a Fox interview—with wife Emily Estes Kavanaugh at his side—a preemptive strategy all about the optics, said author Rebecca Wanzo. The well-worn “good wife” trope sends a message (as it did for Bill Clinton and Clarence Thomas): “if the wife and family are the injured parties, the woman who has brought forth the charge is understood as victimizing a woman and children too.” (A viral photo of women at the hearings, on the other hand, delivered on a very different set of optics.)

For many women it was simply a harrowing day. Daniel Campoamor wrote that Kavanaugh’s “overt anger, his unapologetic willingness to yell and, at times, cut off sitting senators,” triggered a “physical response I was powerless to control.” After she dropped her daughter at school, Tess Taylor pulled over to cry as she listened to Blasey Ford’s testimony and reflected on the hard work still ahead for women: “I cried because I am angry. I cried because I want a world where my daughter trusts her voice and her stories will be listened to.” And Karine Jean-Pierre asked: “What is our duty to a system of civics that no longer serves our people, but severs them from justice”?

Are you kidding?

When Bill Cosby was sentenced to prison Tuesday after years of sexual assault allegations, some of his defenders said he was a black man who was set up. Are you kidding? wrote Kyra Kiles in the Grio. Instead of martyring a predator they should use their energy to help, not silence, victims for “a stranger they ‘know’ only from behind the warm glow of a TV screen.”

The Independent’s Kuba Shand-Baptiste wrote that a reluctant Hollywood Chamber of Commerce needs to scrub Cosby’s star from the “Walk of Fame”: “To suggest that his legacy, and not the people he hurt through it, deserves special protection beggars belief.”

Was laughing at Trump’s UN General Assembly comment really such a good idea? World leaders lost it when President Trump proclaimed that “my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country” – and Nic Robertson has a warning for delegates who joined in: “Hope you don’t get found out. President Trump likes respect. He won’t forget. And he may get the last laugh.”

In any case, his speech was aimed squarely at voters back home, wrote David Andelman. It was a hard sell for “America first” and a hard slam at Iran. The world should worry, Andelman wrote: “Trump’s defiant messaging – given Iran’s steadfast adherence to a nuclear deal that the United States wants desperately to kill – is powerful evidence” that he is hurtling the globe toward nuclear proliferation.

’Censoring’ Bourdain

David Scott Holloway/CNN

The late, great Anthony Bourdain was brilliant and fearless. Here was a writer and storyteller who didn’t give a ****. But what you might not know is that he didn’t get a **** either, or a *****, or even a ****. Not if Marianna Spicer Joslyn could help it. She is executive director of News Standards and Practices at CNN, and was in charge of making Bourdain’s freewheeling show clean enough for cable. “I was Anthony Bourdain’s ‘censor,’” she writes. It was her job to kill off the bad words, plus the fat jokes, the off-color descriptions and the sex talk. But without killing what made Bourdain unique and interesting. “Of course, Tony was very, very funny. We had to seek a middle ground in many areas… Like his viewers, I fell in love with Tony.”

– What is “period poverty?” Amika George, an 18-year old student in London, explains. Thousands of UK girls have to skip school when they menstruate because they can’t afford tampons or pads. George started the #FreePeriods program, eventually getting the British government to allocate money for it, and becoming a hero to many girls. She was in New York last week to pick up a Global Goals Campaign award. “The fight is far from over,” for girls around the globe, she writes. Access to menstrual products must be “treated as a universal human right, not a privilege.”

– The question is: What would Olivia Benson do? With its 20th season premiere, “Law and Order: Special Victims Unit” made TV history this week. And made Melissa Blake wonder if its complicated protagonist Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) is the female role model we need in 2018: “a TV show like ‘SVU’ has never been more relevant – or more needed,” she writes.

Next chapter?

As we head into a new week of Kavanaugh, expect the pending FBI investigation to hang heavy in the air. James Gagliano says leave it to “Carla F. Bad.”

Who’s she? “Well, ‘she’ is the readily memorized acronym that reminds investigators of just what to investigate when looking into someone’s background. It is an enduring checklist that the FBI utilizes to assess honesty and trustworthiness in someone holding, or seeking to hold, a position of trust in our republic,” he writes.

“The acronym represents character, associates, reputation, loyalty, ability, finances, bias, alcohol and drugs. It was presumably employed during Judge Kavanaugh’s multiple background investigations during his tenure in the Bush 43 White House, and when he was appointed a federal appeals judge in 2006.”

Let’s hear what Carla says.

As America approaches the end of Donald Trump’s first year as President, one point on which the entire country can agree is that this has been a year like no other in the nation’s history. If the polls are to be believed, most of us see Trump’s presidency so far as a slow-motion calamity.

And yet, not every development in the last year has been negative. The Trump presidency has energized the country and given it a new mood of seriousness.

It has reminded America about its priorities and caused its people to ponder important questions. Even if he has done so unwittingly, we can thank President Trump for bringing some exciting changes to the country. Here are five of Donald Trump’s greatest unintentional accomplishments.

Sparking the women’s movement and a conversation about decency

It all started before he came into office, when voters heard and saw how he talked to and about women. We heard the women who accused him of sexual harassment; we saw how he disparaged women on the campaign trail; and we saw that he became President in spite of it all.

On the day after the inauguration, millions of women took to the streets around the world to make it clear that women would not sit back and watch Trump’s style become the new normal. The women’s march became likely the largest single day demonstration in US history.

And that was just the beginning. As the backlash against sexism has continued, courageous women revealed the extent of abuse they have experienced in all facets of life. The #MeToo movement took down some of the most prominent figures in journalism, entertainment, politics and elsewhere. And the tsunami against abuse is still raging.

It’s no wonder “feminism” is Merriam-Webster’s word of the year, its most searched term.

It’s no wonder “The Silence Breakers” are Time Magazine’s Person of the Year.

And the best is still to come.

The next elections should bring a tide of women to public office. EMILY’s List, the group that helps women political candidates, reportedly says last year it had heard from about 1,000 women interested in getting its support. This year, the number skyrocketed to 22,000

Killing apathy

Trump’s presidency has electrified the country, creating a sense of energy and urgency unlike anything the United States had seen in at least a generation. Today, even people who routinely muttered, “I hate politics,” and stayed uninvolved, are bristling with political thoughts and following the latest news about Trump’s legislative agenda, the Russia investigation, and matters as obscure as the gap between what Trump says and what his secretary of state argues.

Americans have discovered that political apathy is a luxury better left to people living in countries where they trust their government.

The disastrous cost of apathy became clear after the 2016 election, when far more people stayed home than voted for either Trump or Clinton. As a consequence, the US has become a nation of political junkies and disciplined voters. When Alabamians voted in a special election pitting Trump’s candidate, Roy Moore, against Democrat Doug Jones, turnout surpassed all expectations. In Virginia’s recent elections, turnout was the highest in 20 years for a gubernatorial race.

Raising the question: What really makes America great?

As soon as he took office, Trump started trying to enact the agenda that he claimed would Make America Great Again. But to millions of Americans, Trump’s agenda and rhetoric seemed to highlight precisely the opposite.

Trump forced many who had not given the matter much thought to consider what exactly it is that makes America great: its pursuit of ideals such as respect for the individual, for a free press, for equality; and the sacred notion of “rule of law,” that no individual, however powerful, stands above the law or should wield his power to interfere with justice.

Trump’s attacks on the media, on Muslims, his appalling failure to clearly condemn Neo-Nazis, his repeated use of ethnic slurs, and his relentlessly divisive rhetoric reminded us of America’s most important qualities. Many Americans fear their Democracy is threatened – and feel determined to defend it.

Trump helped us understand the difference between patriotism and nationalism. Patriotism is love for one’s country. It compels us to protect those characteristics that make it worth loving, and to strive to bring the country closer to its ideals. Nationalism, on the other hand, is what Trump preaches in his MAGA creed. It is an attitude of superiority, tainted with notions of ethnic and religious supremacy.

Reinvigorating journalism

When historians look back at the Trump era, they will note that Trump spawned a golden age of journalism. Even as Trump declared war on the media, casting doubt on any piece of news he found unflattering by calling it “fake news,” serious journalists went to work with more determination than ever.

Sure, journalists made mistakes, and when discovered, they were promptly corrected. That stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s avalanche of lies. By The New York Times’ count, Trump has told nearly six times as many falsehoods in 10 months than Barack Obama told in eight years as President. Trump succeeded in confusing the public and blurring reality. It was all in keeping with his gaslighting technique. But the reality-based media fought back with facts and with in-depth reporting that brought Americans history-changing truths.

It wasn’t just the television news networks but also the newspapers, which had seemed fated to die in the electronic age. The New York Times and The Washington Post engaged in a friendly-competition war that benefited the country, scoring major scoops, from the multiple and repeatedly-lied-about meetings between Trump campaign officials and Kremlin-linked figures to the sexual transgressions of powerful men.

As Trump kept attacking the media, Americans flocked to its most prestigious names, willingly paying for credible information. The Washington Post saw digital subscriptions spike to more than a million, and the Times topped 2.5 million – both explosive increases from the pre-Trump days.

Giving satire a shot in the arm

While Trump made Americans more serious, he also made comedians much funnier. Political humor blossomed like never before. Observers noted that the President himself hardly ever laughs unless in the company of adoring crowds, with his sense of humor limited to mocks and insults.

But for professional humorists, Trump was a godsend. The bittersweet cracks propelled the ruthlessly brilliant Stephen Colbert to new levels of hilarity, and the more Trump-centered his jokes became, the higher his ratings climbed.

“Saturday Night Live” also got its groove back with Trump-theme jokes, reaching its highest ratings in decades. Then there was Samantha Bee, also on fire, giving uproarious voice to the Trump-fueled rage of women, also garnering sky-rocketing ratings. People, by the millions, laughed along.

So, you see, it hasn’t all been bad. Perhaps Vladimir Putin is right when he says Trump has made significant achievements. Although, this is probably not what Putin or what Trump has in mind when he falsely claims he has accomplished more than any of his predecessors.

It’s more along the lines of Colbert’s comment after Roy Moore lost the election in Alabama, when he said, “I’m a little shaky … due to a condition my doctor calls ‘hope.’”

These are at least five achievements from the Trump administration that can give Americans that same hope.",2017-12-19 00:00:00
30 top takes of 2017,"(CNN) —

In a year dominated by the beginning of the Trump presidency, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the man occupying the highest office in the land. But Donald Trump’s many actions and tweets weren’t the only subjects of interest. Stories of racism and white supremacist groups, workplace sexual harassment, freedom of the press and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too.

Here are excerpts from a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2017.

David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact

January 31

John Nowak David Axelrod

I woke up this morning as an alternative fact.

In justifying the appointment of Steve Bannon, the President’s chief strategist, to the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited my role in the Obama White House as a precedent. Spicer said press secretary Robert Gibbs and I attended classified National Security Council meetings “all the time.”

That is simply not true.

As a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his National Security Council Principals committee over the strategy the United States would pursue in the war with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the President’s decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it.

Dean Obeidallah: Donald Trump’s most bone-chilling tweet

February 6

Dean Obeidallah

Here is Trump’s truly jaw-dropping tweet from Saturday morning: “The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!”

Why is this so concerning? It’s OK to argue about whether the judge should or shouldn’t have issued this order. But Trump is apparently attempting to delegitimize our federal judiciary by calling Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush-appointed judge, a “so-called” judge while arguing that his decision is “ridiculous.”

Let’s be blunt, because the stakes demand it: An independent federal judiciary is our last, best hope at preventing Trump from violating the US Constitution and illegally grabbing power. And Trump has to understand that, hence his attempt to undermine it.

George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past

February 19

I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.

I remember my mother’s tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn’t sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.

That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion.

Peter Bergen: Why the ‘mother of all bombs’ and why now?

April 13

CNN Peter Bergen

The dropping of a “mother of all bombs” Thursday by the United States on an ISIS cave and bunker complex in Achin district in eastern Afghanistan should be understood as part of an effort to reverse a war that is not going well for the Afghan government and, by extension, the United States.

The non-nuclear 21,600-pound GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) “targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters use to move around freely,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.

Thursday’s bombing had a feeling of deja vu. A decade and a half ago the US Air Force dropped massive 15,000 pound “Daisy Cutter” bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001. Achin district is only a dozen or so miles from the Tora Bora region.

Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights

April 19

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Nikki Haley

The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.

As the US ambassador to the United Nations, I’ve looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign – a loud, blaring siren – that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.

Sarah Lenti: Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option

It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids.

My heart dropped. She didn’t know me at all.

I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family.

Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me – and it isn’t the first.

John McWhorter: A man who is tragically unfit to be president

May 2

Jeremy Freeman John McWhorter

When President Donald Trump revealed that he doesn’t know why the Civil War was fought, or at least figures it could have been averted by the kind of deal-making he supposedly excels at, it was revealing in ways beyond the ones easy to glean.

The ignorance is, as usual, stunning for someone in the public spotlight. “People don’t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War?” Trump asks rhetorically, which is like saying no one has bothered to study anatomy or physics.

Yet this sort of thing should no longer surprise us from this man. He doesn’t read and lacks curiosity, but that’s hardly rare among human beings. A college teacher friend of mine the other day noted that no one in his class could name who was president in the 1980s, nor, upon being told who it was, could they name his political party. People like this don’t mysteriously develop an interest in civics after college. Sometimes they become president.

Michael D’Antonio: The little boy president

May 16

Toni Raiten-D'Antonio. Michael D'Antonio

Like most little boys, Donald Trump can be disarmingly honest, as when he once said, “When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same. The temperament is not that different.” The trouble is that the first grader is now President of the United States, and his temperament is on display for the world to see.

Unpredictable, impulsive and immature, Trump acts in a way that would be expected of a 6-year-old boy, but is terrifying in a man whose moods dictate decisions carried out by adults on behalf of the most powerful nation in the world.

Trump’s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey offers a sterling example of the childish – and reckless – Trump style. When Comey broke with bureau tradition and spoke negatively about Trump’s rival in the election, though initially he was criticized by candidate Trump, he was later praised – and effusively. Over and over again, the soon-to-be-president described how Comey had done the right thing in criticizing Hillary Clinton. Comey remained in Trump’s good graces after he was inaugurated, and Trump’s team expressed confidence in him up until last week.

Anushay Hossain: The ugly truth behind Saudi Arabia’s love for Melania Trump

May 23

Anushay Hossain

Donald Trump’s first major trip overseas may be fraught with diplomatic land mines for the President, but the Trump administration can at least comfort itself with the clear hit that Melania Trump has been with the Saudi press.

The fact that Melania is communicating with the media and the public in Saudi Arabia – mainly through what Saudi news reports have deemed her “classy and conservative” fashion choices – works well in the notoriously anti-woman kingdom. Her intense appeal makes sense, considering the first lady represents so much that Saudi citizens find familiar and can relate to, especially visually. Melania walks behind her husband, is quiet and reserved, does not make obvious demands (at least not ones we can hear), and most importantly, she looks beautiful and polished…

In Melania, the Saudi press and the Saudi government found the perfect spokeswoman, who projects a glamorous image that glosses over one of world’s most autocratic and oppressive regimes.

Gloria Borger: Trump, home all alone

May 30

Gloria Borger

So Trump returns to the White House this week just as he left – lonely, angry and not happy with much of anyone. The presidency, Donald Trump is discovering, is not an easy or natural fit.

“He now lives within himself, which is a dangerous place for Donald Trump to be,” says someone who speaks with the President. “I see him emotionally withdrawing. He’s gained weight. He doesn’t have anybody whom he trusts.”

The question, he adds, is whether Trump will understand the enormity of what he faces or will instead “be back to being arrogant and stubborn.” He will have to realize that “all this trip really did was hit the pause button.”

Douglas Heye: After baseball attack, the hate in politics has got to go

June 14

Jeremy Freeman Douglas Heye

Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an art form. But what we’ve seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others’ motives and legitimacy.

On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate – or a blind “us versus them” tribal mentality – stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks.

Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues.

We know what we will do today. We will pray and we will come together. But what we do tomorrow is even more important.

John Kirby: Here’s what we’re sure of in the USS Fitzgerald collision

June 17

John Kirby

First, we know the crew fought heroically to save their ship and the lives of their shipmates. We know that from early reports by Navy officials but also from the images that flashed across our screens, our tablets and our phones after the incident happened early Saturday.

One look at the crushed, twisted starboard side, the hoses flaked about, the water being discharged, the frantic work being done tells you all you need to know about the stuff you can’t see in those same images: a fiercely brave crew working together to staunch the flooding, to rescue their shipmates and to save their ship.

You can be certain they ended up drenched, exhausted, scraped and bruised – but not broken. They kept that ship from foundering for 16 brutal hours. And they brought her back into port.

Jen Psaki: Putin set a trap and Trump fell into it

July 7

Jeff Mauritzen Jen Psaki

The Russians just played the President. It was predictable. And he let it happen.

On paper, Vladimir Putin should not have had the upper hand going into the meeting.

To start with, Russia has been living with sanctions put in place more than three years ago because of its annexation of Crimea.

And most Americans, save a few people including the President of the United States, are confident that Putin led the Russian intervention into the American election and into many other elections around the world.

President Obama booted out nearly three dozen spies in December and closed two compounds, and there are many, from both parties, calling for an additional round of sanctions on Russia.

We should have had some leverage. So what happened?

Jane Carr: What the white supremacist view of history leaves out

August 18

John Nowak Jane Greenway Carr

The white supremacists in Charlottesville said they wanted to “defend history” by protesting efforts to take down Confederate monuments. They say they feel threatened. They fear the removal of “white stories” from our culture.

I used to teach African-American literature and cultural history. I wish I could tell them what real erasure looks like. I’d ask them to think about the memorials that never existed in public spaces in the South – noting Richmond’s past as a slave market, or the communities of free blacks who were terrorized by the installation of these Confederate monuments in the first place. To take down Charlottesville’s statue of Robert E. Lee will not change the fact that all Virginia schoolchildren know his name, while the names of those who lived in the lost Charlottesville neighborhood of Vinegar Hill are forgotten.

I keep returning to the question: How can people who claim to love history get the meaning of history so very, very wrong?

Lev Golinkin: Jared and Ivanka are failing a basic moral test

August 19

But the silence emanating from Jared and Ivanka was exponentially more powerful than any I’d heard before. To me, as a Jew, seeing nothing but two tweets from Ivanka brought the kind of pain I’m sure is echoed by African-Americans anytime Ben Carson defends the President, and Asian-Americans in the wake of Elaine Chao’s and Nikki Haley’s equivocations: condemning hate in general terms while carefully avoiding criticizing the very administration they’re part of.

No press conference was forthcoming, no rejection of Donald Trump’s words; there was no statement from Jared about the horror his grandparents had survived; nothing from Ivanka, who had spoken about standing up for mothers on the campaign trail, about defending today’s Jewish children – her children; indeed all children – from intimidation and violence. There was nothing, but the sound of steady clicking on Ivanka’s electronic device as she wrote two tweets.

It was like listening to the fabric of Judaism tear at itself.

Fifty-four years later, King’s legacy offers concrete ways of dealing with a contemporary racial landscape that has produced a sense of vertigo in large swaths of the American public. King’s words remain a singular anchor for all those who believe in freedom; by speaking truth to power in a political climate more racially toxic than our own, King did more than dream about racial justice.

He challenged all of us to embrace a vision of a liberated future capable of touching individual hearts and minds as it traversed through the blood and veins of the body politic, on the way to creating a nation as good as the best of its citizens.

Alice Stewart: What Trump got right in Texas

August 30

Alice Stewart

Hurricane Harvey is historic, not just in its size and scope, but in its significance as Donald Trump’s first natural disaster test as President. His “darned if you do, darned if you don’t” decision to visit South Texas on Tuesday, away from the rescue efforts, was the right call. Trump is demonstrating he has the compassion and commitment to meet the needs of victims of the deadly storm.

Critics blasted Trump for not meeting with victims directly to offer his personal condolences. Look, there’s plenty of time for the powerful photos showing comfort, but now is the time for action – not optics. These people are in the rescue and recovery mode, which can only be hampered by the distraction of a presidential visit. They need homes, not hugs; they need structure, not selfies, and they need funds, not a presidential flyover.

Unfortunately, every president has been forced to lead this country through natural or man-made disasters and faced the challenges of serving as consoler in chief: President Barack Obama had the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings; President George W. Bush had 9/11; President Bill Clinton met the challenge after the Oklahoma City bombing. All rose to the occasion.

Likewise, Trump is stepping up to the challenge, reassuring storm victims that resources are on the way.

LaQuishe Wright: Harvey survivor: The loss is hitting me in waves

September 1

LaQuishe Wright LaQuishe Wright

I woke up Friday morning and looked outside at a deceptively beautiful day. Beautiful because my two sons, Bry and Ryan, two dogs and I are safe and dry and the sun is shining again after days of endless rain. Deceptive because our entire life as we know it is submerged in 4 feet of water less than 20 minutes away.

To experience devastation like that brought by Hurricane Harvey feels very different from what you’ve probably seen on television. I was lucky enough to make it out of my house in Katy with my kids, my dogs, our cars and at least some of our belongings and memories. My neighbors’ harrowing evacuations make me feel even luckier to have made it out safely, but I can’t help but be concerned about what comes next for us.

Brooke Baldwin: Speaking like this to women in 2017? No way

September 18

Brooke Baldwin

The newsroom around me fell silent. I was staring into the camera trying to make sense of what was unfolding on live television. I even caught my cameraman Jay’s eyes in disbelief. I thought again: “It is 2017, and this grown man is on my show talking with me – a female host – about boobs. Is this seriously happening?”

And then I did something I’ve done only a handful of times in my career. I told the control room to kill his mic and said “bye.” I invite a variety of people on my show with wide-ranging opinions – sometimes even my jaw hits the floor, too – but I let them speak. Whether it’s left, right or center – I want to expose my viewers to other perspectives. Agree with them or not, the nation needs to listen.

But this … was different.

Eleanor McManus, Why I’m speaking up about Mark Halperin

Fast forward several months later to when I graduated and asked for an informational meeting. I reached out to Mr. Halperin and he asked me to come see him. I was thrilled that someone from ABC News was willing to meet with me – perhaps that was my way in the door. It was my first official meeting; I even had to buy a suit for the occasion.

I don’t quite remember what we talked about, but I do remember him asking me to sit down next to him on the couch. I thought it was awkward to sit on the couch when I was perfectly comfortable sitting in the chair across from his desk. But I complied, and I also remember him sitting a little too close to me…

I’m telling my story publicly now because I hope that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not be so courteous and apologetic. I’m hoping women today will finally speak out in real time – when this behavior happens. Women cannot stay silent for fear it will damage their careers, because that only allows the aggressor to continue his behavior with other women.

Marvin Washington: Kneeling isn’t about patriotism – it’s a distress signal

October 14

Marvin Washington Marvin Washington

I spent 10 years playing in the NFL, won a Super Bowl and have been blessed beyond imagination – in no small part because of the best fans in professional sports – fans of multiple races, genders, religions and political persuasions.

I’m not confused about the role the fans played in my success and neither are the current players in the league. I understand that many NFL fans on both sides feel strongly about the National Anthem protests and the issues of race that underlie them – so do I and so do the current players. I am an African-American who grew up in the 1960s and the vitriol that surged two Fridays ago, stoked by a speech delivered in Alabama no less, is eerily reminiscent for me of that dark time in our history.

Some players had been engaging in periodic protest long before President Donald Trump’s fateful rally, but it’s also fair to say this wasn’t top of mind for most people before that rally. Trump suggested (mostly white) owners should fire any of the (mostly black) players on their teams who engaged in protest during the National Anthem, and he called them a profane name.

The protests, begun by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and now being carried on by current players, are not about patriotism – they are about systemic racial inequality in the criminal justice system. They are about how communities of color are policed – problems that experts on both sides agree on.

Nicole Stamp: What decent men can do in response to #MeToo

October 21

Kevin Jones Nicole Stamp

8. Don’t use gendered or misogynist insults. Words like bitch, cunt, or slut only target women. Sissy, fairy and cuck demean feminine traits as lesser, weak and undesirable in men. Avoid those words. If you must insult someone, focus on their actions, not their body or their gender.

9. Free kids from rigid gender roles. For boys and young men, you can role-model that activities and traits traditionally coded as “feminine” are valuable. Challenge dismissive ideas around what counts as “girl stuff.” Delight in stories with strong female characters. Give a toddler boy a baby doll and praise his gentleness. Race trucks with a little girl. Give kids the tools and confidence to challenge and defy gender stereotypes.

10. Don’t focus on little girls’ looks. Many people’s first interaction with a young girl is to compliment her cuteness, prettiness or clothing. But this tells her – and any boys nearby – that beauty is her most interesting trait. Instead, ask little girls engaging, gender-neutral questions, like “What kind of toy is that? What subjects do you like in school? What’s your favorite animal? Hey, what are you reading?” There are so many things to talk about.

Brianna Keilar: With my husband deployed, covering the news hits home

The last few days the news has been dominated by a controversy over Trump’s call to Myeshia Johnson, a Gold Star widow. She is just 24 years old and pregnant with her third child, mourning her husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in an ISIS ambush in Niger. …

Moments of dignity and solemnity have been interrupted over and over by politics and vitriol and today, it seems, is no different.

I turn the television off and retweet the President’s tweet, commenting, “As I’m watching ‘Taking Chance’ this tweet alerts on my phone. And that about sums up this week for me.”

A few minutes later a man tweets at me: “It’s telling that you are only now watching this. Been out for years. More evidence U and other media R in a bubble & don’t know real people.”

I just can’t let it go.

“My husband is on his sixth deployment right now. You don’t know anything about me,” I reply.

Mr. Trump, please stop it. Please stop!

Think of what Sgt. Johnson would want. You are putting his widow in the terrible position of having to fight for her dignity when she should be concentrating on taking care of herself, her health, her two children, and the one on the way.

Listen to what Myeshia Johnson said this morning in an interview on ABC.

“The President said that he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways and I was – it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn’t remember my husband’s name. The only way he remembered my husband’s name because he told me he had my husband’s report in front of him and that’s when he actually said La David.”

I know you have children – and two daughters.

Can you imagine Ivanka or Tiffany in Myeshia’s shoes?

Mel Robbins: Why Americans don’t give a damn about mass shootings

November 6

CNN Mel Robbins

One month ago, the worst mass shooting in US history took place at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 people injured. Bill O’Reilly boiled the massacre down to six words: “This is the price of freedom.”

I hate to say it, but he is right. Sunday, just 34 days after Vegas, 26 people were gunned down and about 20 others were wounded during a church service in Texas. And here’s what is really sick – we won’t be surprised when there’s another mass shooting next month. Maybe it’ll be your church, your mall, your concert or your movie theater. That’s the price of freedom.

In America, we are free to stockpile weapons. We are free to order ammo online. We are free to outfit our guns with bump stocks, like the Vegas shooter did. This is the price we pay for freedom, alright. The freedom to not give a damn.

Jessica Barth: We could have made Weinstein powerless

November 9

Wes Klain Jessica Barth

It has taken me a few days to process the sudden explosion of allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and assault made against Harvey Weinstein. Each woman who steps forward leaves me with a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, I feel an overwhelming sense of relief and pride when I see women joining together to share their stories. On the other, I experience a sense of horror over the staggering number of accusers. Women stripped of their power, silenced and shamed.

I was one of them and recounted my own experience publicly last week.

In my own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, I have been made to feel as if I had to compromise my own convictions for the advancement of my career. I was made to believe that my talent and experience should take a back seat to my physical appearance. I was manipulated into believing I had “asked for it.” And I was made to feel that if I spoke out or fought back, the repercussions would make me regret it.

At first, David was giddy to be appearing on a prime-time television series. He was cheerful and cooperative, which made my job easier as I worked every angle to come up with stories about this shiny-haired young man. …

A few months later, the nice young man who’d kissed my mom on the cheek in thanks for looking after his puppies was pretty much gone. Whenever I appeared on set, David began to disappear between scenes – during the times he had once joined me for interviews. I couldn’t write about David’s favorite snack food (dry-roasted peanuts) or his favorite color (“It depends on my mood”) or how he felt about his neat new sports car if he was hiding from me all the time.

David Gergen: Trump’s foolish war with the press

November 27

David Gergen

In other words, we are witness to a war between Trump and the press, playing out every day in newspapers and television. Each morning brings a new revelation; each evening touches off a shouting match. It is difficult to remember any press secretary since Nixon’s Ron Ziegler who has faced so much suspicion from the Fourth Estate.

Yet what is equally surprising is how oblivious this White House is to what has gone wrong and how to fix it. His team is as disdainful of history as it is of time-honored traditions about press-government relations. Either they suffer from massive incompetence or extraordinary arrogance.

History has been quite clear: The presidents who have built the best relationships with the press are those who respect its place in American life, have enjoyed a give and take with reporters and care about the truth. From Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt and Jack Kennedy to Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, press coverage has been much more favorable because those leaders in the Oval Office were not only good copy but men of character in their public lives.

Mark Bauerlein: Why Trump is still winning

December 5

Courtesy Mark Bauerlein Mark Bauerlein

This is the real battle going on in D.C. today: not Democrats vs. Republicans but President Donald Trump vs. establishment Republicans. Trump is trampling upon every taboo and sensitivity that liberalism has erected in the last 50 years, and Republican leaders have learned to get by in that uptight habitat. …

And now, the needle seems to tilt Trump’s way.

This correction is not that hard to understand. You see, Trump has an invincible ally at the far end of the ideological spectrum. I don’t mean the extreme right, the nationalists, paleoconservatives, and fringe groups that the media relentlessly tie to the President. He has better friends at the other pole, people on the far left who see the world only through the lens of race, gender, sexuality and victimhood.

Arianne Zucker, I have no fear, so ‘Access Hollywood’ tape will never define me

December 6

c/o Arianne Zucker Arianne Zucker

Now that the “Access Hollywood” tape is back in the news after reports that Donald Trump questions its authenticity, I am puzzled for this reason: Just from experience, anyone who has ever been on television before, with a microphone pinned to them, should always assume that someone is listening. And when you get caught speaking poorly about someone, at least own up to it.

People ask me whether I need or want an individual apology from either now-President Trump or Billy Bush. Well, apologizing to me would be the appropriate thing to do. Am I losing sleep over it waiting for one? Absolutely not.

I refuse to let a situation such as this one take away my emotional power. You are who you allow yourself to be and I did not and will not let this event or any of its aftermath affect who I am as a woman, mother, daughter, friend and partner to a great man.

The Mark Halperin story: I'm writing this so other women won't stay silent like I did (Opinion),"Story highlights Eleanor McManus: When I was just out of college, in a private informational meeting with Mark Halperin, he tried to kiss me and attempted a bit more McManus: I'm telling my story now in hopes that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not fear speaking out

Editor’s Note: Eleanor McManus was a senior producer for CNN’s Larry King Live, and is the cofounder of Trident DMG, a crisis management and strategic communications firm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author.

(CNN) —

The first 10 years of my professional career were spent at CNN. Beginning as a production assistant, I worked my way up to senior producer for “Larry King Live.” I had the most amazing opportunities to work incredible news stories, and even met my husband at CNN. I loved everything about TV news – the excitement, the ability to be part of breaking a story, the adrenaline, and the camaraderie of the entire news team.

But my career at CNN – and in journalism, for that matter – almost didn’t happen.

courtesy Eleanor McManus Eleanor McManus

When I was a 21-year-old student, I attended a political event in Boston. Present were several candidates running for president. It was interesting to see political leaders speak in person for the first time, but it wasn’t the speeches that intrigued me – it was the cameras in the back of the room. The media asking questions, trying to break stories, making their news reports – that was most exciting to me.

So I worked up the courage to go to the back of the room to speak with one of the journalists. That’s when I met Mark Halperin, who was at that time working for ABC News. He gave me his card, told me to give him a call and said he would help me understand how to get into the business.

Fast forward several months later to when I graduated and asked for an informational meeting. I reached out to Mr. Halperin and he asked me to come see him. I was thrilled that someone from ABC News was willing to meet with me – perhaps that was my way in the door. It was my first official meeting; I even had to buy a suit for the occasion.

I don’t quite remember what we talked about, but I do remember him asking me to sit down next to him on the couch. I thought it was awkward to sit on the couch when I was perfectly comfortable sitting in the chair across from his desk. But I complied, and I also remember him sitting a little too close to me.

At one point I felt a bit too uncomfortable, and I stood up to thank him for the meeting. That’s when he leaned in, tried to kiss me, and attempted to do a bit more. I didn’t want to offend the man in charge of political programming at ABC News, and I tried to be courteous and apologetic, and practically ran out of the office. I was upset not by his actions, but the thought that I did something wrong to encourage that behavior. Was my suit too revealing? Did I lead him on? Was this what I had to expect if I went into broadcast news or journalism? If so, I didn’t want any part of it.

Luckily, I was resilient back then and I didn’t let this situation detour my hopes and dreams. I moved to Washington, DC and studied journalism full-time. When I finally landed a position at CNN on “Larry King Live,” I booked celebrities, politicians, and all sorts of newsmakers. One person I vowed never to book on the show was Mark Halperin. If that was my only payback, then so be it.

Over the years I’ve told this story to several people, and only because it irritated me that someone like him became more and more successful and grew through the ranks, getting away with his behavior for so long. It only came to an end this week when CNN reported the accounts of five women who said Halperin had sexually harassed women while at ABC.

As difficult a decision as it was, I thought it was time to come forward with my personal story because hopefully other women will have the courage to come forward and tell their own stories, no longer remaining silent for fear of retribution.

Looking back, knowing what I know now, I should not have been so courteous and apologetic. I should have told him his actions were wrong and reported him to the ABC News HR department. But, as many have said before me, I was young and naive and didn’t want to ruin my career before it even began.

I’m telling my story publicly now because I hope that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not be so courteous and apologetic. I’m hoping women today will finally speak out in real-time – when this behavior happens. Women cannot stay silent for fear it will damage their careers, because that only allows the aggressor to continue his behavior with other women.

I don’t think this behavior will ever go away. But I do hope that from now on, women will finally speak out when it happens to them. Maybe it will empower others – both men and women – to stand up for themselves, and predators will no longer be able to get away with their abhorrent behavior.

A spokesperson for Halperin declined to comment, but pointed us to Halperin’s Wednesday night statement, responding to a CNN article detailing allegations against him by five other women: “During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me. I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize. Under the circumstances, I’m going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.”

On Thursday, HBO, which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner, issued the following statement: “HBO is no longer proceeding with the project tied to the untitled book co-authored by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2016 Presidential election. HBO has no tolerance for sexual harassment within the company or its productions.”

A spokesman for MSNBC, where Halperin has worked as a political analyst, said in a statement: “We find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.”",2017-10-26 00:00:00

Story highlights Nikki Haley: Widespread human rights violations a warning sign that breakdown in security is coming Syrian war just one example of how such violations can spiral into all-out war, she says

(CNN) —

Imagine you are the parent of a boy – a teenager. Policemen come to your home in the middle of the night and take your boy away. He is held without explanation for weeks. And when he finally comes home, your boy has all the marks of having been tortured. Bruises from being beaten. Red, open wounds from being burned. Then you look at his hands and the worst is confirmed. Where his fingernails once were, there are only raw, bloody, exposed nerves. Grown men with pliers, he tells you, ripped his fingernails off in prison.

For a group of parents in Syria in 2011, this was not an exercise in imagination but a horrifying reality. Their boys were arrested and tortured for the crime of writing anti-government graffiti on the wall of a school. When the parents marched in protest to demand their children’s release, security services opened fire on them. When more people came out to protest the killings, the government fired on them again. Soon, the point of no return was reached.

Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/AP Nikki Haley

“We were asking in a peaceful way to release the children but their reply was bullets,” a relative of one of the boys told a reporter. “Now we can have no compromise with any security branches.”

The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.

As the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, I’ve looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign – a loud, blaring siren – that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.

Syria is not alone. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo today, it is no coincidence that reports of government soldiers and armed groups committing extrajudicial executions of civilians in the Kasais region are occurring at the same time that the security situation appears to be quickly spiraling out of control.

These sorts of allegations demand answers from independent investigations. And when violations are found to occur, the United Nations cannot turn a blind eye. We must engage these violators early and often, in the statements we make and the measures we impose. Human rights violations and abuses suffered by civilians rarely have a happy ending. At best, they drive desperate people from their homes and from their countries. At worst, they radicalize them to take up arms themselves.

“Widespread human rights violations are a warning sign – a loud, blaring siren – that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.” Nikki Haley

In other cases, human rights violations and abuses don’t lead to violence down the road, they exist side-by-side with threats to peace and security. In fact, the world’s most brutal regimes are also the most ruthless violators of human rights.

In the case of North Korea, human rights abuses literally finance the government’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Political prisoners work themselves to death in coal mines to finance the regime’s military. Starvation, sexual violence and slave labor in the prison camps help supply the North Korean nuclear program.

In Burundi, the government is using human rights violations to stifle dissent. The Burundian government services use torture to crack down on protestors. This has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee to neighboring countries and caused massive regional disruption. A U.N. report detailed 17 types of torture used by the government, including driving sharpened steel rods into the legs of victims and dripping melted plastic on them.

In fact, there is hardly an issue on the agenda of the Security Council that does not in some way involve human rights. As president of the Council, I’ve had great support from U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres in driving home the connection between threats to human dignity and threats to peace. I’m grateful as well to my colleagues on the Security Council, who agreed to take this unprecedented step.

The next international crisis could very well come from places in which human rights are widely disregarded. Perhaps it will be in North Korea or Iran or Cuba. We don’t know when the next group of desperate people will rise up or when the next gang of violent extremists will exploit human suffering to further their cause. But we know from history that it will happen. And when it does, the United Nations will be called upon to act. We are much better off acting before abuse turns to conflict.

Imagine if we had acted six years ago in Syria. If we learn nothing else from the torture of children, let it be this: Evil is an inescapable fact of life, but the violence that results from human rights violations and abuses is not inevitable. We can choose to learn from history, not doom ourselves to repeat it.",2017-04-19 00:00:00

Story highlights Douglas Heye: Wednesday's attack on Republicans at a baseball field reminds us that hateful rhetoric accumulates and causes things to escalate Whomever the targets, it was perhaps inescapable that something tragic was coming in an environment like this, Heye writes

Editor’s Note: Douglas Heye is a CNN political commentator and former deputy chief of staff to then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) —

Shortly after Wednesday morning’s attack on Republican members of Congress practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game, Congressman Rodney Davis, still in his baseball clothes, spoke to CNN’s Brianna Keilar.

In addition to describing the events he witnessed, he spoke from the heart.

“This hatefulness that we see in this country today over policy differences has got to stop … Republicans and Democrats need to use this day today to stand together and say ‘stop.’ Let’s work together. Let’s get things done,” he said. “We can have our differences, but let’s not let it lead to such hate.”

Jeremy Freeman Douglas Heye

We should all heed Congressman Davis’ call, including our President. Since his announcement to run for office, Donald Trump has consistently yelled fire in a crowded political theater by castigating various segments of our population and encouraging his supporters to “knock the crap” out of protesters. And on and on.

Many Donald Trump supporters have followed his lead, escalating the rhetoric against political opponents and the media. A reporter was choke-slammed in Montana. And before Trump, too many Republicans engaged in awful and, let’s face it, racist attacks on President Obama. Perhaps even worse, too many Republicans watched this happen and remained silent.

Meanwhile, town halls, opportunities that should allow for a respectful dialogue between elected officials and voters, have become opposition events where silencing and jeering the politician has become the norm.

President Trump holds the world’s largest microphone and therefore can do the most to quell much of the angry rhetoric we’ve seen.

But it doesn’t end with our President. Since he was elected, many Democrats have continually upped the ante to out-resist each other in opposition to President Trump. Their behavior has created an environment where Democratic lawmakers routinely stoop to foul language in public events. It’s also a climate where a comedian and a theater company feel it’s somehow acceptable to post gruesome pictures of a decapitated president or stage a Shakespeare classic to envision the assassination of a politician who bears a strong resemblance to Donald Trump.

And in this case, where the shooter appears to have been a volunteer for Bernie Sanders, Democrats too have some soul-searching to do. Senator Sanders has strongly condemned the suspect, and he is right that “violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.”

These things accumulate, which means they inevitably escalate. And whether the targets are Republican members of Congress, like today, or Democratic politicians or members of the media, it was perhaps inescapable that something tragic was coming in an environment like this.

Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an artform. But what we’ve seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others’ motives and legitimacy.

On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate – or a blind “us versus them” tribal mentality – stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks.

Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues.

We know what we will do today. We will pray and we will come together. But what we do tomorrow is even more important. A successful, bi-partisan Congressional Baseball Game sounds like a perfect way to start.",2017-06-14 00:00:00

Story highlights The US has long respected and promoted science, Nye writes Nye: Science is being undermined by ideological forces motivated to maintain the status quo

(CNN) —

I was proud to join thousands of concerned citizens, scientists and engineers in Saturday’s March for Science. With more than 600 marches taking place around the world, we conveyed that science is political, not partisan, and science should shape our policies.

Although it is the means by which humankind discovers objective truths in nature, science is and has always been political. Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution refers to promoting “the progress of science and useful arts” to motivate innovators, stimulate the economy and establish just laws.

The US has become the most powerful nation on Earth and among the greatest in history, because it has long respected and promoted science. Countless policies, from military deployments to regulations that control the formula of a shampoo, are based on science.

Scientific research depends on government investment (approximately $65 billion in the US last year), which itself relies on a social compact: that basic research across all fields is beneficial to a nation.

Currently, science is being actively undermined by ideological forces motivated to maintain the status quo rather than advance the nation’s long-term interest. This is especially true of the extractive fossil fuel industries. When facing tides of deliberate misinformation, scientists, engineers and researchers have taken it upon themselves to organize and raise awareness about their professions and the vital importance of the scientific enterprise.

By marching, scientists had no choice but to engage more in the political sphere. They face staggering proposed budget cuts in energy, medical and environmental research. The denial of the accepted facts of science, along with the rejection of well-established theories – such as evolution and especially climate change – have cultivated anti-science policies that harm people, economies and our global environment.

Science is a process that enables continual innovation, extraordinary public works, reliable transportation, and food for the world’s billions. Consider what the US has achieved in space science; the national pride and cosmic perspective of our planetary home are priceless. Science is universal. Countries around the world have followed suit and established space programs to garner similar benefits.

Without science, the US, any country in fact, cannot compete on the world stage. Yet today, we have a great many lawmakers, not just here but around the world, deliberately ignoring and actively suppressing science. It’s another formula – a formula for disaster. Imagine your world without printed words of any kind – paper, electronic or otherwise.

How would your life be without electricity, let alone information technology? Consider a city with no sewers. Be thankful for antibiotics and polio vaccines. These technologies derive from our science.

To suppress scientific discoveries such as evolution, the benefit of vaccines, or global warming apparently based on nothing but intuition will soon prove costly and fruitless – and in some heretofore-productive agricultural regions, very costly and literally fruitless. These examples and countless others are connected to policy issues, which can only be addressed competently by understanding the natural laws in play.

As a society, we want informed citizens, who can make good judgments in the voting booth. We ignore natural laws at our peril.

At the 600-plus Marches for Science around the world this Earth Day, we reminded everyone, our lawmakers especially, that science serves our society, and science must shape our public policies. The science marches can prove effective by prompting action. May the facts be with us.",2017-04-22 00:00:00

I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.

I remember my mother’s tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn’t sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.

That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion. On its face, the order was “neutral,” authorizing the military to designate whole swaths of land as military zones, and evacuate any persons from it as they saw fit.

But behind that facade lay a much darker purpose: to tear 120,000 innocent Japanese-Americans from their homes along the West Coast and relocate them to 10 prison camps scattered throughout the United States.

It didn’t matter, back then, that most of us were US citizens and had never even been to Japan. We were presumed guilty, and held without charge for four years, simply because we happened to look like the people who had bombed Pearl Harbor. For that crime, we lost our homes, our livelihoods and our freedoms.

Every year, on February 19, we Japanese-Americans honor this day as Remembrance Day, and we renew our pledge to make sure what happened to us never happens again in America. I am always amazed, and saddened, that despite our decadeslong efforts, so many young people today are not even aware that such a tragedy and miscarriage of justice took place here.

And I grow increasingly concerned that we are careening toward a future where such a thing would again be possible.

A few months into his campaign, Donald Trump refused to outright reject the policies and fears that underlay the internment. Instead, he suggested that it was a tough call, and that he “would have had to be there” in order to know whether it was the wrong one.

Trump ignored the inconvenient fact that not a single case of espionage or sabotage was ever proven against any internee, and that the military itself admitted that there was never any evidence to support their sweeping policy. A few months later, a top Trump surrogate went on television and suggested that the internment might actually serve as a “precedent” for another Trump policy – the registration of Muslim-Americans in a database.

I cannot help but hear in these words terrible echoes from the past. The internment happened because of three things: fear, prejudice and a failure of political leadership. When the administration targets groups today, whether for exclusion from travel here on the basis of religion and national origin, or for deportation based on their undocumented status, I know from personal experience that these are not done, as they claim, truly in the name of national security.

No, instead they are intended to strike fear into communities, to show the muscle and “toughness” of a new president, and to divide the citizenry against itself. These are the acts of a despot, not an elected leader.

I have dedicated my life to standing against our nation’s impulse toward demagoguery and tyranny by the whipped-up masses. The answer lies not just in education, but in empathy. The false narrative – that there are those who belong here and those who do not – is designed precisely to divorce us from the truth that we are all here and in this together.

We are an interdependent people, sharing a common bond of humanity. The most pernicious aspect of Trump’s policies is thus the denial of those basic bonds and that humanity. I will not stand for it, and no people of good conscience should.

The question before us, then, on Remembrance Day is a simple one: Will America remember? The internment is not a “precedent,” it is a stark and painful lesson. We will only learn from the past if we know, understand and remember it. For if we fail, we most assuredly are doomed to repeat it.",2017-02-18 00:00:00

Political analyst David Axelrod attends a Democratic presidential debate sponsored by CNN and Facebook at Wynn Las Vegas on October 13, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Story highlights Contrary to what Sean Spicer said, Axelrod says he and Robert Gibbs did not regularly attend the most sensitive National Security Council meetings Axelrod: Former Breitbart chief Steve Bannon will exercise authority no political adviser has had before

Editor’s Note: David Axelrod is CNN’s senior political commentator and host of the podcast “The Axe Files.” He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) —

I woke up this morning as an Alternative Fact.

In justifying the appointment of Steve Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, to the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited my role in the Obama White House as a precedent. Spicer said press secretary Robert Gibbs and I attended classified National Security Council meetings “all the time.”

That is simply not true.

As a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his National Security Council Principals committee over the strategy the U.S would pursue in the war with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the president’s decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it.

We knew our presence chagrined some of the principals but, acting on the president’s instructions, we were there to gain a thorough understanding of what would be one of the most important judgments he would make as commander-in-chief.

Our access also came with limits. We were barred from some of the most sensitive meetings on the Afghanistan-Pakistan policy review so as not to inhibit discussions.

Beyond that, Gibbs and I did not attend regular meetings of the NSC Principals committee or their deputies nor were we invited to weekly meetings on terrorist threats.

We did not attend the president’s regular meetings with the Secretary of Defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff nor with the Secretary of State.

We did not sit in on the president’s daily intelligence briefing.

Our expertise was in politics and communications, not national security and foreign policy and our attendance, much less participation, in these meetings would have been inappropriate.

Where aides were needed, the National Security Adviser and Chief of Staff filled the role.

In elevating Bannon to sit with the Secretaries of Defense and State and other key national security figures on the NSC principals committee, President Trump has blazed new ground. Bannon will exercise authority no political adviser has had before. He will be a full participant, not an observer, in national security deliberations.

Under the president’s announced structure, Bannon has eclipsed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence on the National Security Council.

Indeed, Bannon already has emerged as the president’s most trusted adviser on global affairs, an area in which Trump has little expertise.

It was Bannon who guided the drafting of Trump’s controversial immigration order. According to reports, the Secretary of Defense and director of Homeland Security were not consulted; the State Department was caught unawares.

The order, which has roiled the world, reflected not only Trump’s campaign pledge for “extreme vetting” but the white nationalist, anti-immigrant bent of Breitbart News, the organization Bannon led before joining Trump’s campaign team.

Trump’s warmth to right-wing populist movements in Europe and hostility to trade and global institutions are wholly consistent with the worldview of Bannon’s Breitbart, which recently opened bureaus in France and Germany in advance of elections there.

Ten days in, this much is clear: Steve Bannon is playing a role in national security and foreign policy for which there is no precedent.

And for better or worse, he already is making an impact.",2017-01-30 00:00:00
The Donald Trump presidency: How the world sees it,"(CNN) This time last year, CNN Opinion asked a group of commentators from around the world for their take on the US presidential election. One year later, Donald Trump is preparing to be sworn in as President of the United States. So, what is the world expecting -- and hoping for -- from a Trump presidency? Guest commentators from around the world weigh in. The views expressed are their own.

Russia: A domestic win for Putin

When Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, he received a round of applause in the Russian parliament. It was a pure, almost childish expression of joy.

Since then, the ""Russian factor"" has loomed ominously over Trump's impending presidency. The Russian term "" kompromat "" -- compromising material -- is entering the English language, much like ""sputnik"" did more than 50 years ago. The American press debates -- in total seriousness -- whether the Kremlin is literally keeping the President of the most powerful country on Earth on its leash and shaping his policies. More importantly, the notorious hacking story is far from over. For many in Washington, Vladimir Putin has become the main trickster of the election.

However, Russian officialdom was hardly expecting a Trump victory. Viewing the American election as a zero-sum game with the West, Putin planned for a likely defeat. Before Election Day, Russia's propaganda machine was warming up to announce that a flawed American political system would never let the anti-establishment candidate win. That was supposed to be Russia's consolation prize.

Then, defeat suddenly turned into victory. Russia is beyond satisfied with this serendipitous turn of events. A happy and astounded Kremlin will now try to get the most from Trump -- from easing sanctions to making a deal on Syria and settling the Ukraine issue.

It is difficult, of course, to predict how Trump's administration will address these issues and what the result will be. But this uncertainty hardly undermines the feeling that Russian officialdom has been experiencing: a sense they have achieved a moral victory over the West and its values.

Since the annexation of Crimea, the West has labeled Putin a pariah and a global threat. Yet now, Trump's win has made something clear: It is not Putin who is a weak outlier before the world's liberal order. Rather, it is the West that is divided and full of resentment. An outcast yesterday, Putin may now see himself as a major power broker in the emerging global Trumpworld.

The least that the Kremlin will now expect from the White House is a display of respect and equality. After what has been presented by Russian propaganda as years of unprecedented humiliation and offense from the West, Putin will easily sell his country's newfound parity with the United States to the Russian public for his own personal gain.

Transforming Putin's moral triumph into a dramatic expansion of Russian influence on the global stage will be trickier. But from the Kremlin's point of view, it is probably doable.

Mexico: Will Trump really pursue his 'Mexican agenda'?

Ana Maria Salazar

Throughout his campaign, we all hoped he would tone down such rhetoric so as not to alienate the Hispanic vote (too much, at least). However, his rhetoric simply became more vitriolic -- and more threatening.

So President Enrique Peña Nieto invited him to Mexico , perhaps in hopes that the hospitality and reality of bilateral relations would change Donald Trump´s opinion about the southern border (and awkward facts such as there being potentially millions of jobs at stake -- on both sides of the border -- if he decided to scrap NAFTA).

But mere hours after returning from Mexico, not only did Trump NOT change his mind, but he engaged ( in Arizona of all places ) in some of his most anti-immigration rhetoric yet. Meanwhile, in Mexico there was a backlash against Peña Nieto's decision to invite Trump, forcing Finance Minister Luis Videgaray -- seen as instrumental in arranging the visit -- out of the Cabinet.

As the votes were tallied on election night, there was hope that Trump's rhetoric was campaign garbage and not genuine policy. But in the two months since the election, Trump has reiterated his calls for a wall, insisted that Mexico will reimburse the US for the cost and called for the renegotiation of NAFTA and a border tax for companies that invest in Mexico and wish to send their products to the United States.

On the back of all this, the Mexican peso has plunged, and there is concern that on January 20, the least popular person in decades to be sworn in as US President will deliver a speech that could be catastrophic for the Mexican economy.

Since losing his role at the finance ministry, Luis Videgaray has been appointed foreign minister, and will head negotiations with the United States. Perhaps the President is hoping that Trump will now play and negotiate in an appropriate way. He likely is wrong.

Through his threats, tweets, and speeches, Trump may have left the President and his negotiators with no political wiggle room to sign any kind of agreement that requires ratification by the Mexican Senate. And the chances for a candidate from Peña Nieto's party will likely be scuppered in the 2018 presidential elections unless the President can convince Trump not to initiate massive deportations and to stop insisting on building the wall.

But if Trump believes his ""Mexican agenda"" helped get him elected, it is hard to imagine he will do anything but continue to insist on his beautiful wall, deportations and a new and ""improved"" NAFTA agreement.

Israel: Netanyahu breathes a sigh of relief

Yaakov Katz

After eight years of hostility and tension with President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will let out a huge sigh of relief Friday when Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

For Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition government, Trump's presidency is viewed as a new beginning when it comes to Israeli-US relations. One government minister went so far as to say that Trump's victory in November signals that ""the days of the Messiah"" have come.

That might be a stretch, but for Israel, Trump seems like the antithesis of the outgoing president.

While Obama regularly pressured Israel to stop construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Trump's advisers have said they will not. While Obama refused to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, Trump has said that he will . And while Obama championed the Iran deal that Israel aggressively tried to prevent, Trump has raised the possibility that he will scrap it.

While this all bodes well for the current government in Jerusalem, it remains to be seen what Trump will do when it comes to Israel's ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. Will he follow the longstanding US policy of pushing for a two-state solution or will he offer new options for a resolution?

Will he stand strong against settlement expansion or will he allow Israeli annexation of settlements as some government ministers are advocating?

So far, Trump hasn't said much, although the announcement that his son-in-law Jared Kushner will serve as the president's Middle East envoy seems to indicate that he plans to take on the thorny issue.

Like other countries in the Middle East, Israel is hoping to see a more engaged America playing an active role in the region. The presence of Russian military forces in Syria, for example, is believed to be directly linked to Obama's decision not to enforce his ""red line"" on the use of chemical weapons in that ongoing civil war and humanitarian disaster. Leaving a vacuum allowed Russia to enter the country.

Will Trump re-engage the Middle East or will he prefer to remain on the sidelines and stay away from a region that has for decades frustrated consecutive American presidents?

Starting on January 20, the world will begin to get some answers.

India: Did America get its Modi?

Sanjay Kumar

On the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, India is experiencing some of the same kind of anxiety it felt when Narendra Modi was about to become the country's prime minister, back in May 2014

A right-wing Hindu leader with a controversial political past who cultivated an image as an outsider, Modi's rise to power disturbed the existing political equilibrium in the country, and his election brought with it a heightened sense of unpredictability and uncertainty among not just Indians, but overseas as well. Indeed, for many -- particularly the country's liberals -- it took quite some time for the reality of a Modi premiership to sink in.

A sense of disbelief and uncertainty has gripped many people here again.

Will the improvement in India-US relations continue with a Trump administration? How will Indians settled and working in the United States be treated? Will the protectionist measures that Trump is talking about impact Indians living abroad? Will such policies affect the outsourcing that keeps so many Indians in India working?

These are just some of the questions Indians have. But the questions also extend to international affairs -- how is India going to adjust if Washington decides to revise Obama's policy towards the Middle East and western Asia? Policymakers in New Delhi are already worried, for example, that reimposing sanctions on Iran would impact India's crude oil supply and delay the completion of Chabahar port that will create a new trade route for Afghanistan and drastically alter the trade dynamics in South Asia.

In addition, New Delhi is also keenly waiting to see how Trump goes about dealing with Pakistan. Will he continue the old policy of transactional engagement with the Muslim state or take a firm line over its support for terror groups?

But there is a more philosophical concern among liberals in India: The potential impact of a close political entente between Modi and Trump. The fear is that the political proximity between the two leaders, who have strong anti-Muslim, anti-minority images, will unleash and strengthen forces inimical to liberal and secular values. Such sentiment is already simmering in India since Modi assumed office in 2014 -- and his presence has contributed to keeping the Indo-Pakistan relationship on tenterhooks.

Many on the Indian subcontinent see Trump as Modi's alter ego. Closer ties between them might prove to be a double-edged sword for our country.

Britain: Trump creates a stir

On Monday, the British people learned that Donald Trump's late mother was an admirer of the British monarchy. ""She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, 'cause nobody does that like the English,"" he told an interviewer

A family weakness for the British nostalgia industry is unlikely to have much impact on his approval rating among a population deeply concerned about the President-elect's ethics, prejudices and mental stability.

What did get the UK talking was the identity of the interviewer. Michael Gove, who recently left the British Cabinet after losing a leadership election, has returned to his role as a columnist for The Times of London. He remains a prominent figure in Westminster politics and has retained his seat in the House of Commons.

Meeting with Trump in his capacity as a journalist, Gove is only the latest right-wing figure to irk the British government by flaunting a relationship with the President-elect outside official channels. Prime Minister Theresa May, who clashed frequently with Gove when they were Cabinet colleagues under David Cameron, has made clear that such freelance diplomacy will not hasten his political rehabilitation.

Even Gove, however, failed to match the stir created when the President-elect was pictured with Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, before he had met representatives of the governing Conservative Party.

When Trump then suggested on Twitter that Farage should be appointed ambassador to Washington, May was furious. In Britain, where ambassadorships are traditionally held by long-serving career diplomats, this was seen as unprecedented interference in the affairs of Her Majesty's Government. The Queen nominally appoints each ambassador and takes a close interest due to her contacts with other heads of state. If Trump shares his mother's fondness for the Queen's ceremonial role in British life, he would be well advised to respect her protocol.

As well as securing a scoop for The Times, Gove's main aim in meeting the President-elect will likely have been to impress on him the existence of prominent Brexiteers other than Nigel Farage. Farage has enjoyed high visibility on British TV, his divisive rhetoric delivering strong ratings. Unlike Trump, he has not succeeded in translating that into electoral success, having failed at seven attempts to win a seat in Parliament . He was excluded by the official ""Vote Leave"" campaign in the UK referendum, run by more mainstream members of the Conservative Party, and campaigned instead with a smaller, unregistered ""Leave EU"" team dominated by UKIP. The anti-European movement in Britain is riddled with personal divisions; Gove, who played a major role in ""Vote Leave"", will have bridled at Farage taking credit for the referendum.

None of these subtleties are likely to deter the British government from maintaining a formal alliance with the United States as long as it remains a world power. But the President-elect would be wise to avoid playing favorites with squabbling British politicians. Serious concerns remain about the future of the relationship with Britain; elements in the security services are concerned about the legal implications for the "" Five-Eyes "" intelligence sharing system should Trump authorize the use of torture by their American partners. In Scotland, he has long been an unpopular landlord, indulging in an ongoing feud with the ruling Scottish National Party over environmental and planning issues.

Diplomacy by Twitter is not the British way. The Queen would not approve.

Germany: Will Merkel confront Trump?

Almut Möller

From a Berlin perspective, there is a particular irony in the inauguration of Donald Trump as the next US president. Today's Germany in many ways is a product of the post-World War II era in Europe on which the United States has spent so much time and resources over the past decades.

Locking Germany into a collective European order has been key to pacifying the European continent, and has served Germany particularly well. Indeed, the principles that are so strongly rooted in this country are largely tied to the pacifist attitudes of the German public and a preference for an economic rather than a security role in foreign affairs. There is also a strong reflexive support among Germans for multilateral approaches aimed at building global institutions and international law, as well as for the need for Germany to have a predictable foreign policy.

But what Berlin has understood from the President-elect so far is that Donald Trump is not really very interested in any of these principles. Instead, his rhetoric runs counter to some of the most formative instincts of the political elite in Germany -- and of the public at large. The question Germans have now is how Berlin will react once President Trump actually starts to shape politics rather than talking about it?

And there has been plenty in the talk so far to cause concern. For example, just last weekend, Trump gave a major interview with widely read German newspaper BILD Zeitung in which he called into question the role of NATO and the future cohesion of the European Union. Both institutions are fundamental pillars of German foreign policy.

Angela Merkel gave a first glimpse of her mindset in a news conference with the prime minister of New Zealand in Berlin that same day. ""I think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands,"" she said when asked about Trump's comments. By her usually cautious standards this was another remarkable statement following her initial reaction to Trump's election back in November.

When President Barack Obama gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in the summer of 2013 , he called for an end to German complacency in international affairs. Developments in and around Europe over recent years have already seen a much more active Germany on the European and international stage. Berlin has understood that some of its vital interests -- both in economic and security terms -- have come to be challenged.

Trump is going to ensure Germany accelerates along this path, a reality that will have major implications for Germany and Europe. Berlin has a realistic understanding of its power, and where the German government has the resources to punch its weight it will attempt to do so.

But how willing will Germany be to confront President Trump on fundamental questions over the future of the European and global order? Germany currently holds the G20 presidency. That might give us a sign about how much Merkel is willing to say.

China: Trump should avoid the Taiwan card

Shen Dingli

While the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's incoming administration doesn't bode well for anyone, the instability ahead could begin to recede if the new executive branch is willing to learn and acts sensibly.

For instance, Trump has repeatedly demanded ""fair trade"". No one rejects the idea of fair trade, but if the focus is on ""fair"" rather than ""unfair"" trade, then the key issue is who decides what type of trade is fair or otherwise.

As long as the United States does not exit the World Trade Organization, America, like any other member of the WTO, is subject to the body's arbitration mechanism to settle trade disputes.

The Trump administration may renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement or quit the Trans Pacific Partnership, but if it does, it will still be opting for negotiation and bilateral trade agreements with Asia-Pacific nations and other trade partners. In other words, Trump may not be a fan of globalism, but he still subscribes to bilateralism and even internationalism.

China, for its part, could well live with a China-US bilateral trade and investment framework, along with a WTO cap. The ongoing negotiation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty is an example. Trump wants ""smart"" negotiation, to which China has no objection. But if Trump refuses to settle disputes through negotiation, then China won't be happy.

Still, China is wary of the possibility that the Trump team might try to play the Taiwan card as part of any bargaining. This would be unacceptable -- China may be willing to negotiate or renegotiate over trade, investment and currency levels, but it will in no way be willing to renegotiate the ""One China"" principle . This is one thing that China will never put up for sale.

If the Trump administration can understand this key point quickly, and if it acts in a diplomatic way, then Trump does indeed have a chance to make America truly great again.

South Africa: Trump brings a new style

Tinashe Chuchu

South Africans in general were more inclined to support Hillary Clinton for president, but that did not happen. Why the support for Clinton? Because South Africans valued the longstanding relationship that their nation had developed with the Clintons, especially during the Mandela years.

Now that the election is over and Donald Trump has won, South Africa -- like many other nations -- hopes that it will be able to secure favorable trade relations with the Trump administration. Of course, the signs from the Trump camp suggest that the incoming administration will take a tough stance on trade. And though Trump did not single out South Africa specifically for criticism, he did warn more broadly that deals would need to be rethought because the United States is always losing out on trade agreements.

Another issue that might be of interest to South Africans is US immigration policy toward South Africa. Again, Trump warned over the threat posed by certain kinds of immigration, which became a feature of his campaign. If he cracks down it could make it tougher for South Africans wishing to secure a US visa.

But it's not all trepidation. Some South Africans admire Trump's apparent success with his own businesses. They hope that he will enjoy similar success running the United States. Indeed, if Trump is successful and the US economy performs well under his presidency, countries like South Africa will likely benefit, too.

As John Stremlau, former vice president of the Carter Center, told Africa's News24 , it is still unclear what shape the Trump administration's foreign policy will take. However, as a businessman, it seems that Trump is determined to try his hand at making deals. It will be interesting to see what this new style means for business with Africa.

Egypt: A lesson for Americans

Adel Abdel Ghafar

The election of Donald Trump was welcome news in Cairo. The US President-elect and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met each other on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting last September. After that meeting, both expressed a mutual admiration for one another. Sisi remarked that Trump would make a strong leader, which Trump reciprocated by praising Sisi as a ""fantastic guy."" Sisi was reportedly the first Arab leader to congratulate Trump, and recently reportedly stated to the Egyptian press that he knew Trump would win as ""his honesty touched the hearts of the American people.""

It's not hard to imagine why these two men would get along. Both are not particularly fond of protecting human rights, and have demonstrated a deep disdain for the press. They abhor Islamists of all shapes and forms. Neither man handles criticism well, as demonstrated by their emotional outbursts. Both admire Vladimir Putin, who has spent time cultivating them both.

Overall, they share an identical black and white world view, reminiscent of George W. Bush's ""you are either with us or against us."" There is no middle way in Trump and Sisi's world; only enemies to be annihilated or friends based on mutual interests.

With regards to Egypt and the Middle East, discourse on human rights and democratization will become background noise, as the Trump administration's foreign policy will likely focus on advancing US economic and security interests. Trump and Sisi began collaborating even before the President-elect assumed office: Trump reportedly called on Sisi to withdraw the U.N. resolution against Israeli settlements , which ultimately passed.

Conveniently, the Egyptian media has dropped the commentary from Trump about Muslim bans and registries from its coverage, while equating the President-elect with Sisi; a strongman who will bring stability in an age of turbulence. However, almost three years since Sisi's election, many segments of the Egyptian population feel disappointed in his leadership, as he has failed to bring stability or usher in the era of economic prosperity that he promised.

Given time, the American people, like their Egyptian counterparts, are also likely to find themselves profoundly unhappy with their new president.

Philippines: Will Trump challenge Duterte?

Mong Palatino

Considering that there are, by some estimates , around 300,000 Filipinos living as undocumented migrants in the United States, the question for many here is whether President Donald Trump will be true to his campaign promise of being tough on illegal immigration.

As for the about 3.5 million Filipinos living in the United States , they join other Americans in hoping that the Trump presidency will deliver stable jobs, better health care, and safer communities.

Like other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines wants to know whether Trump will continue to endorse the rebalancing of American forces toward the Asia-Pacific region. More specifically, Filipinos have two other questions on defense: What will Trump's policy be regarding the maritime dispute in the South China Sea involving China and its smaller neighbors? Will he uphold the mutual defense pact between the Philippines and the United States?

It is not only on defense that a Trump presidency raises questions for Filipinos. In terms of his economic program, for example, many wonder whether his vow to protect American businesses will mean less investment in the Philippines and the rest of Asia? They also wonder whether his call for the return of manufacturing and outsourced jobs to the United States will disrupt Asian economies.

Interestingly, Trump is often compared to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Both are non-traditional politicians who achieved surprising electoral victories despite their controversial, divisive -- sometimes politically incorrect -- views.

Duterte has frequently criticized the United States for its colonial crimes and political meddling, even making an unprecedented declaration of a ""separation"" of the Philippines and the United States. President Obama chose to ignore Duterte's rants. Will Trump do the same thing? Will he comment on the alleged American plot to destabilize Duterte's government

Both are interesting questions. But perhaps the biggest question mark is over whether Donald Trump will raise the issue of human rights with Duterte, whose war on drugs has, by many accounts, left thousands of civilians dead.

Filipinos are extremely curious to find out what happens next.

Story highlights As the Obamas moved out of White House, David Axelrod returned to recall big challenges of Obama's first days there Axelrod: Whatever happens next, he has done some good work that cannot be erased and will not be forgotten

(CNN) —

The walls, just days earlier bedecked with portraits of President Obama at work, were covered with empty frames, awaiting a new leading man.

The hallways that had been buzzing with energy were strangely still, as all but the most senior staff had already turned in their badges and moved on. In the mostly emptied West Wing, those who remained packed up a few last items between hugs, handshakes, laughs and memories.

The White House on Thursday was winding down, the day before the wheel of democracy turns out one cast and ushers in another.

As the hours ticked down on the Obama era, I returned to see old colleagues and friends, some of whom had walked into that citadel of American government with me eight years ago.

On that day, the vibe was entirely different. The place filled with the frenetic energy of something new and momentous.

Even as we located our offices and familiarized ourselves with our rarified surroundings, we plunged into the work of saving the country from an epic economic crisis – the worst since the Great Depression. There were two wars raging and 180,000 troops in harm’s way and Osama bin Laden was alive and still plotting against America.

What we would quickly learn is that as we labored through these challenges, others would arrive unexpectedly. Pirates, pandemics and massive oil leaks on the sea floor do not fit neatly into your planning calendar. That’s the nature of the presidency. Events have a way of hijacking your days and the story.

I smiled the other day when the president, at his final news conference, shared the advice he had given his children in times of stress. “The only thing that’s the end of the world…is the end of the world,” he said.

His wisdom and equanimity had helped the country and buoyed his staff through times that felt as if they could be the end of the world. And those qualities were on display again these past two months when a stunning election result left so many unsettled.

Those who lingered at the White House on Thursday wondered which pieces of Obama’s legacy would survive the stark change of leadership that Friday will bring. But there are so many things that simply cannot be erased.

History will record that at a time of maximum crisis, this president made a series of courageous and difficult decisions to save our economy and the American auto industry. I was there. I saw it. He never flinched.

He had the foresight, through the Recovery Act, to plant the seeds of a renewable energy industry that has blossomed and is the future. It will not be turned back.

He fought for equal rights for all Americans and helped lead to a sea change in how gay Americans are treated. On this issue, our country is not going back.

And while the incoming administration and Congress have made the repeal of Obamacare their rallying cry, no longer is it considered acceptable for people with pre-existing conditions to be refused insurance, or women to be charged exponentially more than men.

Americans now expect to be able to cover their adult children up to the age of 26, and they won’t accept any plan that dumps 20 million Americans from the insurance rolls.

The reforms that have cut costs and improved care and helped curb runaway inflation in health care spending have changed the industry in lasting ways.

Perhaps spurred by fears of repeal without an adequate replacement, the health care law derisively named for the president by its opponents has never polled as well or been as popular as it is today.

Obama has shifted the starting point for the debate on health care. Wherever it lands, we are never going back to where we were eight years ago.

Beyond his many durable achievements, nothing will erase the memory of a president who brought dignity, honor and integrity to the Oval Office. He set high standards of conduct for those around him. He and his family were wonderful role models, so welcome in these times of coarsening culture.

We’ll remember those moments of amazing grace, when he lifted our spirits, and the evenness with which he faced an implacable and sometimes bitter opposition.

Through eight challenging years, he never succumbed to cynicism. He came as a believer in the fundamental ideals of our democracy, he pushed for them and he leaves as their champion.

I stopped in to see my old friend on his final day in the Oval Office. I told him how proud I was of him and grateful to have been along for some of this amazing journey.

“We did some good work here,” he said.

As administrations change, it might feel like the end of the world to those who worked for this president and to some of the many Americans who, by the latest counts, like and support him. It is not.

Whatever happens next, he has done some good work that cannot be erased and will not be forgotten.",2017-01-20 00:00:00

Roxanne Jones: Beyonce gets Super Bowl show right

CNN Roxanne Jones

February 9

“There were nods to Michael Jackson, to Black Greek step shows, to Malcolm X and a salute to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panthers. For a minute, watching Beyonce and those strong black women sporting black berets and big afros march out onto the field, I forgot I was watching a Super Bowl performance. For the first time I felt like I wasn’t just a spectator of the game but that the game had become a part of my black experience in America. With just a few lyrics, Beyonce connected with black women everywhere. Her performance became personal.”

David Axelrod: A surprising request from Justice Scalia

John Nowak

February 14

“Justice David Souter, Scalia’s longtime colleague on the court, had just announced his retirement, creating a vacancy for President Obama to fill. Scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president, I might have some influence on the decision – or at least enough to pass along a message.

’I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation,’ said Scalia, then in his 23rd year as the court’s leading and most provocative conservative voice. ‘But I hope he sends us someone smart.’

A little taken aback that he was engaging me on the subject, I searched for the right answer, and lamely offered one that signaled my slight discomfort with the topic. ‘I’m sure he will, Justice Scalia.’

He wasn’t done. Leaning forward, as if to share a confidential thought, he tried again.

’Let me put a finer point on it,’ the justice said, in a lower, purposeful tone of voice, his eyes fixed on mine. ‘I hope he sends us Elena Kagan.’”

Jay Parini: Why the hate for Hillary Clinton?

Jay Parini

March 20

“Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can’t be denied, though many will try. Don’t forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children’s Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That’s only the beginning.

And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings, in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of ‘Why don’t they like you?’

Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus – certainly no fan of Clinton’s – recently wrote in The Washington Post that ‘there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.’ As we’ve seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points.”

Danny Cevallos: Abby Wambach’s arrest for a crime that makes no sense

Danny Cevallos

April 4

“Why? Why do people who otherwise would never commit a crime somehow get arrested for drunken driving? Sure, it’s a question of personal responsibility, but why is it so much easier for upstanding citizens to refrain from all other crimes, except DUI?

It’s the mixed signals. Most other criminal activity unambiguously violates our social norms. There’s no ‘gray area’ when it comes to smoking meth at a cocktail party, for example. Most crimes are also social faux pas, such that you would neither engage in, nor tolerate the behavior from a peer.

With DUIs, however, there are mixed messages. Most people are surprised to learn that it’s not actually illegal to drink and drive. Technically, it’s only illegal to drive while ‘impaired’ by alcohol. What does ‘impaired’ mean?”

“Fat is a floating signifier. It can attach to anyone at any moment. Ask Amy.

But why do we care what anyone weighs? Well, the stakes are high when being thin or fat determines whether you’ll be loved, respected, hired, promoted, dated, married, able to travel, buy clothes, see people who look like you in mainstream media, get unbiased medical care, and count as a person – or not. (And these are just a few examples.)”

Edythe McNamee/CNN John D. Sutter

April 8

“Shortsighted government officials have strangled the Mississippi River with so many dams and levees that it doesn’t deliver the soil that’s needed to rebuild the marshes. Instead, all of that useful dirt, which normally would be deposited slowly as the river wiggles across a wide and free delta, is rushed out to the bottom of the sea. Oil and gas canals and pipelines, meanwhile, have carved up what’s left of the marsh, making it more vulnerable to collapse.”

Stephanie Coontz: The awkward truth of ‘make America great again’

Stephanie Coontz

April 29

“Idealizing the era when America was the economic powerhouse of the world, bipartisanship reigned and male breadwinner families were the norm requires overlooking much else. Nostalgia is never random. We cherry-pick the past, highlighting what we like and leaving out the things we don’t, even if they were closely intertwined.

So when Trump says let’s “make America great again” and Clinton says let’s make it ‘whole again,’ they neglect to mention how much the prosperity of the postwar era depended on a system of regulation and taxation that neither of them shows any inclination to reinstate.”

Michael D’Antonio: Donald Trump isn’t crazy

“As 16 Republican primary opponents failed to stop Trump’s momentum, the idea that he is crazy seemed to miss the mark. The word “crazy” conjures up a person who is so plagued by delusions, or perhaps hallucinations, that he makes no sense at all.

Consider his success, both before and during his pursuit of the presidency, and it’s hard to argue that Trump suffers from such a profoundly distorted view of reality.

In fact he has long demonstrated a keen awareness of how our society worships celebrity and rewards those who can attract the limelight and hold its focus.”

Peter Bergen: Bin Laden’s spectacular miscalculation

CNN Peter Bergen

September 8

“For so long the two great oceans of the Atlantic and the Pacific had protected America from its enemies, but no more.

Yet, for all their tactical success the 9/11 attacks failed strategically and, in the end, achieved precisely the opposite of what Osama bin Laden had intended.

There are, of course, differences between the post-World War II era and the post 9/11 era. The long-term aftermath of Pearl Harbor was not only a decisive Allied victory in the war but also decades of American leadership and dominance.

After its initial success in Afghanistan following 9/11, victory was not decisive for the United States. Instead, American forces continued to be at war with a number of shadowy jihadist groups, most recently ISIS, and this now seems like a quasi-permanent state of affairs that could persist well beyond the next presidency.”

CNN Commentators: Who won the first presidential debate?

David Hume Kennerly for CNN Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton shake hands at the first presidential debate on September 26, 2016, in Hempstead, New York.

September 27

David Gergen: “By all traditional standards of debate, Mrs. Clinton crushed. She carefully marshaled her arguments and facts and then sent them into battle with a smile. She rolled out a long list of indictments against Donald Trump, often damaging. By contrast, he came in unprepared, had nothing fresh to say, and increasingly gave way to rants. As the evening ended, the media buried him in criticisms.

Even so, I doubt she has put him away.”

S.E. Cupp: “In contrast, Trump mostly did the job he had to do. To move undecideds, he had to hammer one point home: Clinton is a politician who doesn’t get it. Over and over again, he attacked her as more of the same, out of touch, and a politician who hasn’t gotten it right. He didn’t go after her character or personal issues, for the most part – which voters know well. She outmanned him on specifics and details. But his attacks were far more effective than hers.”

Dean Obeidallah: Trump’s beef with SNL is no laughing matter

Dean Obeidallah

October 16

“[Trump’s] message was clear: Mock me, and I might sue you.

Couple all this with Trump’s calls during this campaign to change the libel laws to make it easier for him to sue media outlets who unfairly criticize him, and this is no laughing matter.

Would a President Trump use the apparatus of the federal government – such as the Federal Communications Commission – to intimidate comedians and dissuade them from mocking him? Yes, I know we have a First Amendment, but alarmingly I bet there are Trump supporters who would go along with anything Trump asks for, even if it was flat out unconstitutional. (Trump has bragged as much, claiming he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would stand with him.)”

Barack Obama: America will take the giant leap to Mars,"A newly released study from NASA shows Mars had an ancient ocean that might have been as large as Earth's Arctic Ocean.

STAR CITY, RUSSIA - MARCH 5: In this handout from National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA, Astronaut Scott Kelly is seen inside a Soyuz simulator at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) March 5, 2015 in Star City, Russia.

Story highlights Barack Obama: Space program shows America's boundary-pushing curiosity. We do what's possible before anyone else He says next step is to reach for Mars: learn to build new habitats that can sustain astronauts on long missions

Editor’s Note: Barack Obama is President of the United States.

(CNN) —

One of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather’s shoulders, waving a flag as our astronauts returned to Hawaii. This was years before we’d set foot on the moon. Decades before we’d land a rover on Mars. A generation before photos from the International Space Station would show up in our social media feeds.

I still have the same sense of wonder about our space program that I did as a child. It represents an essential part of our character – curiosity and exploration, innovation and ingenuity, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and doing it before anybody else. The space race we won not only contributed immeasurably important technological and medical advances, but it also inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers with the right stuff to keep America on the cutting edge.

Pete Souza/The White House President Barack Obama

That’s one of the reasons why, in my first address as President to the American people, I vowed to return science to its rightful place. In our first few months, my administration made the largest single investment in basic research in our history, and I went to the Kennedy Space Center to call for reimagining and reinvigorating our space program to explore more of our solar system and look deeper into the universe than ever.

In the years since, we’ve revitalized technology innovation at NASA, extended the life of the International Space Station, and helped American companies create private-sector jobs by capitalizing on the untapped potential of the space industry.

Last year alone, NASA discovered flowing water on Mars and evidence of ice on one of Jupiter’s moons, and we mapped Pluto – more than 3 billion miles away – in high-resolution. Our space telescopes revealed additional Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, and we’re pursuing new missions to interact with asteroids, which will help us learn how to protect the Earth from the threat of colliding with one while also teaching us about the origins of life on Earth. We’ve flown by every planet in the solar system – something no other nation can say. And we continue to drive down the cost of space exploration for taxpayers.

This week, we’ll convene some of America’s leading scientists, engineers, innovators and students in Pittsburgh to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers. Just five years ago, US companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it. More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.

We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we’re already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station.

The next step is to reach beyond the bounds of Earth’s orbit. I’m excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth – something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars.

The reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times, John Noble Wilford, later wrote that Mars tugs at our imagination “with a force mightier than gravity.” Getting there will take a giant leap. But the first, small steps happen when our students – the Mars generation – walk into their classrooms each day. Scientific discovery doesn’t happen with the flip of a switch; it takes years of testing, patience and a national commitment to education.

President Eisenhower knew this: In 1958, he devoted great resources to science and math education around the same time he created NASA. And it’s why I’m proud that we’ve passed important milestones in STEM education. For the first time, more than 100,000 engineers are graduating from American schools every year, and we’re on track to accomplish my goal of training 100,000 excellent new STEM teachers in a decade.

When our Apollo astronauts looked back from space, they realized that while their mission was to explore the moon, they had “in fact discovered the Earth.” If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last, we won’t just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we’ll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves.

Someday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We’ll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we’ll know that because of the choices we make now, they’ve gone to space not just to visit, but to stay – and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.",2016-10-11 00:00:00
Michelle Obama: This issue is personal for me,"Story highlights Michelle Obama launched global girls' education initiative Let Girls Learn She traveled to Morocco and Liberia with Meryl Streep, Freida Pinto and CNN's Isha Sesay Her trip was documented in the CNN Film ""We Will Rise""

Editor’s Note: Michelle Obama is the first lady of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Watch CNN Films’ “We Will Rise: Michelle Obama’s Mission to Educate Girls Around the World” on CNNgo.

(CNN) —

For me, education has never been simply a policy issue – it’s personal.

Neither of my parents and hardly anyone in the neighborhood where I grew up went to college. But thanks to a lot of hard work and plenty of financial aid, I had the opportunity to attend some of the finest universities in this country. That education opened so many doors and gave me the confidence to pursue my ambitions and have a voice in the world.

For me, education was power.

And a few years ago, when I had the honor of meeting Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head just for trying to go to school, this issue got really personal for me. I saw that the terrorists who nearly killed her were trying to silence her voice, snuff out her ambitions, and take away her power.

That’s why I decided to work on global girls’ education as first lady: because right now, there are tens of millions of girls like Malala in every corner of the globe who are not in school – girls who are so bright, hardworking and hungry to learn. And that’s really the mission of the Let Girls Learn initiative we launched last year: It’s a global effort to give these girls the education they need to fulfill their potential and lift up their families, communities and countries.

Now, as first lady, I have no budget of my own for programs, and I have no authority to make or pass laws. That’s why, when we first launched Let Girls Learn, many folks doubted that we could make a real impact on this global issue.

Michelle Obama: For girls, a heartbreaking loss – and an opportunity

But over the past year and a half, we’ve established partnerships with some of the world’s largest companies and organizations that are committing money, resources and expertise. We’re collaborating with countries like Canada, Mexico and the Nordic countries on girls’ education efforts. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have collectively pledged nearly $600 million.

The United States is investing over a billion dollars through new and ongoing efforts and running Let Girls Learn programs in more than 50 countries. The World Bank Group will be investing $2.5 billion over the next five years. And through social media campaigns, Let Girls Learn has rallied people across America and across the globe to step up and be champions for girls worldwide.

All this is happening because time and again, whether it’s a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a 15-year-old girl here in the United States, when people hear the stories of girls who aren’t in school, they want to help.

That’s why CNN’s new film on global girls’ education, “We Will Rise,” airing for the first time this week, is so critically important – because it tells these girls’ stories.

This powerful film chronicles the lives of some of the girls I visited this past summer in Liberia and Morocco, two countries in Africa where many girls struggle to get an education. I was joined in my travels by the actors and activists Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto, who are also passionate about girls’ education, as well as CNN anchor Isha Sesay.

Together, we sat down with girls in both countries to discuss the barriers they face and the dreams they hold for their futures. Like so many girls around the world, many of these girls come from families struggling with poverty. Some endure dangerous commutes to and from school each day. Others face cultural pressures to drop out, marry young and start having children of their own.

But these girls have big plans for their lives. They want to attend college and become doctors, teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs; and day after day, they do whatever it takes to get the education they need to fulfill their dreams. They get up before dawn, and spend hours harvesting crops, cooking for their families and tending to their younger siblings before heading to class. After school, they work as maids and in factories, and they study for hours late into the night.

I hope you will be as moved by their stories as I was – and I hope you’ll visit LetGirlsLearn.gov to learn more about how you can take action to help girls like them worldwide go to school.

Unlike so many girls around the world, we have a voice. That’s why, particularly on this year’s International Day of the Girl, I ask that you use yours to help these girls get the education they deserve. They’re counting on us, and I have no intention of letting them down. I plan to keep working on their behalf, not just for the rest of my time as first lady, but for the rest of my life. I hope you will join me.

Story highlights Orlando mass killing fits grim pattern of homegrown terrorism, writes Peter Bergen Since 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes

Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book “United States of Jihad: Investigating America’s Homegrown Terrorists.”

(CNN) —

The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.

Because 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.

But Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.

In fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.

In other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.

Similarly, Nidal Hasan came to the attention of the FBI a year before he carried out the massacre at Fort Hood because he was in frequent email contact with a militant cleric in Yemen.

Mateen was investigated by the FBI in 2013 for inflammatory comments he made to co-workers and a year later because of his connections to Moner Abu Salha, an al Qaeda recruit who grew up in Vero Beach, Florida, and who died in a suicide attack in Syria in 2014 on behalf of the Nusra Front, al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate.

But in the end, the FBI didn’t pursue cases against Mateen, Tsarnaev or Hasan.

Although, according to a U.S. official, Mateen pledged allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call around the time that he was carrying out his assault at the Orlando nightclub, no evidence has emerged that he received training from ISIS in Syria, unlike the terrorists who killed 130 in Paris in November and 32 in Brussels in March.

Based on what we know now, Mateen appears similar to other jihadist terrorists in the States since 9/11. There have been more than 300 jihadist terrorism cases in the United States since the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The perpetrators are not the young hotheads of popular imagination. The individuals in these cases have an average age 28, a third are married and a third have children. Mateen was 29 when he carried out the attack, has been married twice and has a three-year-old son.

The homegrown terror threat poses a knotty problem for U.S. law enforcement, as lone wolves are not communicating via email or on the phone with foreign terrorist organizations, the type of communications that can be intercepted by the U.S. intelligence community. Nor do they have meetings with co-conspirators of the type that can be monitored by the FBI.

The FBI has said that it is mounting 900 investigations of suspected Islamist militants in all 50 states. Complicating the difficulty of detecting a mass killer like Mateen is the fact that he worked for a global security firm and was a licensed security officer in Florida, which may have made him – like Maj. Nidal Hasan – less suspicious to law enforcement.

The attack in Orlando reminds us that despite all these FBI investigations, sometimes American terrorists will still succeed in carrying out an attack.

Story highlights Mel Robbins: Statement of rape victim moving to women, but the ones who should read it are men and boys She says assailant's father wrote clueless letter to judge that speaks volumes on why rape so often goes unpunished Robbins: Rape is not about alcohol, it's about a decision to rape

This commentary has been updated since its publication. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

I just finished reading one of the most powerful things I’ve ever seen.

If you’ve already seen it, you likely feel the same way:

It is riveting. It’s raw. I hung on every single word.

It is the 12-page victim impact statement written by a woman who was raped in January 2015 on the Stanford University campus after a night of drinking at a party.

03:56 - Source: CNN Stanford rape survivor's letter to her attacker

The power of her words stood in stark contrast to those of the father of her attacker. He, too, wrote a letter to the judge who held his son’s fate in his hands. It is deeply disturbing in its plainspoken and clueless banality, and tells you everything you need to know about why the crime of rape so frequently goes unpunished in America.

This is a case with no ambiguity. There were witnesses to her attack: two male Stanford students were riding their bikes across campus when they spotted Brock Allen Turner on top of a woman who wasn’t moving. These men are among the heroes in her heartbreakingly sad story.

They chased him, tackled him and held him until the police came. The victim had no memory of the rape. She was unconscious behind a dumpster when Turner assaulted her. His defense: she consented.

He was convicted of all three felony accounts and will register as a sex offender. He faced 14 years in prison, and will only serve six months. (update: Turner was released from jail Friday after serving 3 months of his sentence.)

At the sentencing, the victim read her letter aloud and addressed Turner directly. In it, she gives a harrowing description of her rape and a jaw-dropping account of its aftermath. Reading it will expose you to the horror every rape victim faces as she is retraumatized over and over while society seeks “justice” against her rapist.

I’m a parent. I was so moved that I printed out a copy. I wanted my family to read it. Not just our two daughters, but my husband and our son.

That’s who should be reading this letter. Give it to your sons, your brothers and your mates.

If anything is going to change the culture of rape in our society, it will be a turnaround led by men like the two guys who stopped it that night and the Santa Clara county district attorney, Jeff Rosen, who called the sentence “unjust.”

Rosen added that “the fact that the defendant preyed upon an intoxicated stranger on a college campus should not be viewed as less serious than if he assaulted an intoxicated stranger in downtown Palo Alto… Campus rape is no different than off-campus rape. Rape is rape.”

We women know all too well about victim blaming, alcohol as an excuse for assault. It’s not alcohol that’s raping women; it is men.

Our sons, all the young men in our lives need to be told: Alcohol is never an excuse

As the victim wrote: “Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked.”

It’s black and white: If a woman is drunk, she can’t consent.

After hearing from the victim, the judge also considered the appalling letter from the rapist’s father, Dan Turner.

In it, he pleads with the judge for leniency for his son, explaining that his son should not have to go to prison for “20 minutes of action.” The father describes how “this” has affected his son negatively—he has lost his appetite and doesn’t like eating “ribeye steak” anymore.

He writes, “The fact that he now has to register as a sexual offender for the rest of his life forever alters where he can live, visit, work, and interact with people and organization.” He argues that his son’s “life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve.”

In the end, the judge sentenced Turner to six months in county prison, saying a harsher penalty would have a “severe impact” on the aspiring athlete. His sentence includes probation and his name in a sex offender registry.

That last part isn’t to punish Turner – it’s to protect us all from him. You know why he has to register as a sexual offender? It’s because he committed a sexual crime.

Even after the trial. Even after the conviction, there is still denial – Turner’s dad writing that his son has “never been violent to anyone including the night of” the crime! Twelve jurors believed otherwise. And now the Turners will appeal.

Social media has been rightfully ablaze. The most compelling tweet I have seen is this one by Twitter user Jez Kemp, who edited the dad’s letter to highlight the victim-blaming, swapping in female pronouns to illuminate the issue. Take a look:

Rape isn’t a story about alcohol. It’s one of choices. And every man has a choice. To rape or not. To rescue or ignore. To deliver justice or give someone a slap on the wrist.

The only thing that will change this is awareness by men. The good guys. That’s why I’m asking you to share this letter with your sons, your brothers and your friends.

One more thing to share with them? If they see a woman who is passed out, here’s what they should do with her.

Transgender rights: 'We need a restroom revolution',"It's not the first time toilets have divided America

(CNN) —

Before I launch into the argument for making all restrooms in the United States gender neutral – that is, removing “men’s” and “women’s” labels – I want to show you a photo.

This is James Parker Sheffield.

Now a truly ridiculous question: Which restroom do you think he should use?

Men’s or women’s?

In the United States at the moment, the legal answer depends on location. If Sheffield is in North Carolina, it’s illegal for him to use a public men’s restroom. Since he’s a transgender man – his birth certificate has an “F” on it – he has to use the women’s.

If he’s at home in Atlanta, he can use the men’s.

“It’s now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife,” Sheffield wrote on Twitter along with his selfie. He posted that message in March, only hours after North Carolina passed a law making it illegal for transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond with their true gender identities.

The U.S. Justice Department recently said the law violates the Civil Rights Act. North Carolina on Monday sued the feds in defense of the regulation.

As it’s written, Sheffield would have to use the lady’s room or break the law.

That’s absurd, as the selfie and tweet make clear. Sheffield is a 36-year-old man who lives in Decatur, Georgia. He has a scruffy beard and a receding hairline, which he jokingly calls a “reverse fade.” If he walked into a lady’s restroom he’d likely be met with stares or screams or worse.

But you know what else is absurd? The idea that Sheffield – or anyone else – should have to choose a male or female restroom at all. And, beyond that, that any of us would feel entitled to decide someone else’s gender for them – and, consequently, where they can and can’t pee.

This isn’t a binary gender world. People don’t fit neatly into the “M” and “F” boxes. It’s time our public restrooms reflected that. The fairest way to do so is to desegregate restrooms by sex, and that means eliminating the men’s and women’s rooms in favor of “all gender” restrooms.

Think that’s an overreaction? Take a quick look at the history of bathroom politics in the United States. We’ve tried time and again to control who we sit and stand next to at the toilet.

In the 1960s, black civil rights activists were killed for trying to use “whites only” bathrooms. In the 1980s, gay men were harassed because the public wrongly assumed they could catch HIV-AIDS from a toilet. (AIDS was viewed then as a gay man’s disease). Restrooms weren’t required to be accessible to people with wheelchairs until the Americans with Disabilities act of 1990. And now, some cities and states are trying to keep transgender people out.

The only justification is bigotry and ignorance.

You might think that allowing a transgender person to use the restroom of their choice is a workable solution. It’s a first step. But Sheffield and others who don’t conform to gender norms face discrimination even when they’re legally allowed to choose which restroom to use.

Seventy percent of transgender people surveyed in Washington, for example, a city with progressive laws allowing people to use either restroom, reported “verbal harassment, assault and being denied access to public restrooms” because of their identities, according to a report from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. Further, 54% reported medical problems “like dehydration, urinary tract infections, kidney infections and other kidney problems” because they avoided using restrooms entirely.

Sheffield told me he plans his days around where he can and can’t pee.

“I almost never go to the restroom in a place I haven’t been at least once before,” he told me. He cuts appointments short and avoids going out simply to avoid peeing in public. Sometimes he’ll find the one stall in a men’s room is occupied, or out of order. Other times he sits on the toilet for longer than necessary because he worries it’s suspicious a man would sit down to urinate.

“It’s not a good feeling to be a grown-up and wondering, ‘Am I going to make it to a restroom on time – and how do you explain it if you don’t,’” he said.

Such fears apply not only to transgender people but also those who don’t meet our rigid gender norms. In 2013, I met a female middle school student in Mississippi, for example, who told me her teachers wouldn’t let her use the girl’s restroom because she had short hair and wore hoodies. She looked too boyish.

Gendered restrooms support these biases.

“We need a restroom revolution in this country,” said Kathryn Anthony, an architecture professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I agree. And there are simple places to start. Restaurants and small businesses with two single-unit restrooms simply can paint over the “M” and “W” on their doors and – ba-da-bing! – they’re gender inclusive. No one’s harmed as long as we men stop peeing on the toilet seat.

Philadelphia recently made that concept law for single-stall bathrooms. Other governments and businesses should follow. (And if you’re a business that is considering this sort of move, please send me a tweet).

Then, bigger leaps: The International Building Code should suggest all-gender restrooms become the norm, or at least be included, in larger businesses and public establishments. (That idea comes from Terry Kogan, a law professor at the University of Utah.)

City, state and federal governments also could legislate these restrooms into existence, too.

It won’t happen immediately, but new construction and renovations could be subject to our updated understanding of which types of bathrooms are safest for everyone. That’s the precedent set by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Kogan said.

Harvey Molotch, a professor of sociology at New York University and co-editor of the book “Toilet: public restrooms and the politics of sharing,” outlined for me what he considers to be the Holy Grail of restrooms. Walk in and you’d see a long line of private toilet stalls, with floor-to-ceiling doors. On the other side would be a row of communal sinks. Anyone is free to use any stall – and there might be a row of urinals tucked away somewhere to the side.

The urinals could be left out of some restrooms, but they should be kept when possible, Molotch said, because they’re much more water-efficient than sit-down toilets.

All this sounds wildly inoffensive to me.

And it’s already happening.

The Cooper Union, a college in New York, announced on March 18 that it is removing gender identification from restrooms on campus and opening single-occupancy toilets up for anyone’s use. “We have always been ahead of our time and we must continue being leaders on issues of social justice,” Bill Mea, acting president, wrote in an email to the campus.

The Urban Justice Center, also in New York, made a similar move a decade ago.

“I’m delighted to be able to share that our experiences have been wholly positive,” the center’s executive director, Doug Lasdon, and a development associate, Hugh Ryan, wrote in a recent op-ed in the Washington Post. “To this day, we have not received a single complaint. Not one in a decade. Nor have any incidents of violence or harassment been reported.”

There’s little counterargument other that bias and squeamishness.

Sheffield, the transgender man in Georgia, doesn’t expect the all-gender restroom revolution to occur anytime soon. “If we could go to sleep tonight and wake up and all the bathrooms were gender neutral – great! But it’s not practical,” he said. “It’s not going to happen that way.”

In the meantime, he said, a little courteousness would help.

“We can’t hold it,” he said. “Trans people have to pee multiple times a day, just like everyone else.”

Currently, there are only two places Sheffield feels comfortable peeing.

One’s at home.

The other’s at work.

And that’s because it’s labeled “all gender restroom.”

Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford died from cancer on March 22. Ford speaks during the kick off of his re-election campaign in 2014.

Story highlights Former Toronto mayor Rob Ford died of cancer after a widely publicized struggle with drug and alcohol addiction Patrick Krill: Why do we empathize with the sufferer of one disease, cancer, while people mocked him for his addiction, which is another disease

Editor’s Note: Patrick R. Krill is a licensed attorney, board certified alcohol and drug counselor, author and advocate. He is the director of the Legal Professionals Program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) —

“Rob Ford fought cancer with courage and determination. My condolences and best wishes to the Ford family today”. –Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, via Twitter.

Courtesy of Hazelden Patrick R. Krill

As is now customary with the passing of public figures, social media exploded with condolences for the family of the late Mayor Rob Ford on Tuesday, making it clear that a man once the subject of merciless ridicule was now being afforded a level of sympathy and kindness unfathomable just a few short years ago.

Across the Internet and media, punchlines have largely been replaced by dignified tributes, and crude caricatures by staid, objective reporting. Why? Because Rob Ford, alive as an alcoholic, was apparently less deserving of compassion and understanding than Rob Ford, now dead from cancer.

True, the fond remembrances and generous consolations are heartening, refreshing expressions of decency towards a family in grieving, and yes, they should be acknowledged and welcomed as such. To be clear, however, they are also the indisputable byproduct of the type of image makeover nobody wants — a cancer diagnosis.

Fueling Ford’s trajectory from viciously mocked to politely mourned, his cancer demonstrated how malleable our emotional responses are in light of our moralizations. Rob Ford was, after all, a man who suffered from two life-threatening diseases but garnered sympathy for only one. Perhaps that dichotomy is worth us, as a society, examining.

When I first wrote about Ford for CNN in 2013, I hoped to make the point that he wasn’t that different from many people all around you — outwardly successful while secretly buckling under the weight of alcohol or drugs — and that addiction is a nondiscriminatory predator that strikes everywhere. But despite addiction’s widespread presence and nonbiased grasp, a significant majority of society still doesn’t view it — or react to it — the way we do other, less stigmatized diseases that makes us want to reach out and support the sufferer.

In fact, it wasn’t until Ford was diagnosed with what is unequivocally accepted as a “real” disease that many were able to accept, forgive and even admire him for his fight to survive. Sadly for the hundreds of thousands of people who die from the disease of addiction every year, such acceptance and forgiveness never comes.

In a study published the year after Rob Ford first made international headlines for his struggles with drugs and alcohol, researchers from Johns Hopkins found that 90% of people would not want someone with addiction to marry into their family, and 78% did not want to work alongside addicted people.

Furthermore, survey respondents were more willing to accept discriminatory practices against persons with drug addiction, more skeptical about the effectiveness of treatments, and more likely to oppose policies aimed at helping them. It is impossible to even conceive of similar statistics for cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, and you won’t see “Saturday Night Live” doing a sendup of a politician’s COPD or epilepsy symptoms anytime soon.

Why is it that we continue to deride sufferers of one disease and openly project benevolence and humanity towards victims of another? Is emotional parity for diseases truly beyond our capacity, even between two that are felling ourselves and neighbors at a frequency and volume that leaves no life untouched?

Despite the fact that excessive drinking is responsible for one in 10 deaths among working-aged Americans, or that drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, we rarely see the type of outward support for, and rallying around, people struggling with addiction as we do other illnesses.

Families are often times left to shoulder their emotional burden alone in shame and silence, an injustice made final when underlying causes of death are cloaked behind less scrutiny-inviting terms like “liver failure,” or “heart disease.”

Although even many forms of cancer itself are caused by heavy drinking, you’re unlikely to see blameworthy “alcoholism” listed in the obituary of a throat cancer victim. After all, few families left behind would choose to diminish sympathy and invite judgment for their deceased loved one. But is a forced choice between honesty and sympathy really the best we can do?

In the absence of available proof to the contrary, I’ll make the assumption that Rob Ford would have been extended at least some level of eulogistic courtesy had his other disease taken his life. At least that’s what I’ll hope. But what we can’t overlook is how compassion and empathy were scarce commodities during his high-profile battle with addiction, and how they shouldn’t have been.

Addiction is a sadly pervasive struggle in our world, present in your neighborhood and mine. The Rob Fords of the world are all around us, and they shouldn’t have to die of cancer before we can view them humanely, on social media or otherwise.

Story highlights Michael D'Antonio: Voters must scrutinize Trump's claims of success, beliefs, character He says Trump's record is a litany of flip-flops and fabrications

Editor’s Note: Michael D’Antonio is the author of the new book “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success” (St. Martin’s Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) —

Having long ago committed himself to the proposition that there is no such thing as too much press, Donald Trump may be the most photographed, filmed and quoted man of our time.

Toni Raiten-D'Antonio Michael D'Antonio

Add his own words, offered in books, speeches, Facebook posts and Tweets, and you might conclude that there’s little left for this man to share.

But think again. What if all those words were intended, not to reveal, but conceal? What if Trump talks so much because he wants to control the conversation?

Now that Trump is the GOP’s presumptive nominee for president, he’ll face more intense scrutiny about his many claims to personal success, his political beliefs, his temperament and his character. In each case, the public record is filled with incidents and examples, but a skeptic finds little clarity.

This state of affairs may suffice for anyone buying a steak or an apartment from Trump the salesman, but voters contemplating Trump the candidate for president deserve better answers to the lingering questions.

Here they are:

What is Trump’s temperament?

TV audiences have been treated to more than 100 episodes of Trump’s reality TV shows “The Apprentice” and “Celebrity Apprentice.” The Trump depicted on air is the product of so much editing and consulting by producers and directors that it is no better than a cartoon. More useful is the cumulative Trump record, which includes as many negatives as positives.

To Trump’s credit, he has shown himself to be resilient, coming back from failures that would have sent less confident men and women into business exile. Most notable, of course, is the crisis he experienced in the early 1990s when he was unable to pay personal and corporate debts in the neighborhood of $3.4 billion.

Trump is also a nimble entrepreneur, who looks for opportunities and seizes them decisively. Witness his ability to deal in real estate, entertainment and retail merchandising, all at the same time.

On the other side of the ledger, open questions remain about his consistent record of cruelty and excess when dealing with critics and competitors. Trump’s code begins with the belief that he’s justified in “hitting back ten times harder” whenever he’s offended. If our presidents believed in this approach, America would have engaged in shooting wars with untold numbers of countries that have, in recent decades, committed transgressions against the United States.

Would Trump have hit back 10 times harder when North Korea detained the spy ship Pueblo? What about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over the territory of our ally Ukraine. U.S. intelligence indicates a Russia missile likely was responsible. Would Trump have responded by downing 10 Aeroflot planes?

We can ask additional questions about Trump’s penchant for bullying. In some cases this trait has shown itself in mere words, as he has attempted to humiliate, disparage and marginalize others. In other instances he has sought to force innocent landowners off their properties to make way for his developments. This willingness to use any means necessary to get what he wants raises serious concern about Trump’s ability to manage America’s affairs in a complex world.

What does Trump believe?

More than any political figure in modern times, Trump represents an ideological puzzle. Although he now claims the conservative Republican mantle, he has often associated himself with liberal and Democratic Party ideas. In 1999 he told CNN, “I’ve actually been an activist Democrat and Republican.”

In the past, Trump said he is “totally pro-choice.” Now he is against abortion rights, recently musing about punishing women who might violate a ban on the procedure.

02:02 - Source: CNN Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary

In the past, Trump was in favor of levying a big tax on the rich, himself included, to pay down the federal deficit. Like banks, rich people have the money, and Trump reasoned that they could afford to help the country out. Today, Trump is in favor of big tax cuts for the wealthy.

In 2000 Trump proposed banning private ownership of assault weapons and increasing the waiting period for the purchase of guns. In the current campaign he has declared himself to be an ardent defender of gun rights, and he has even proposed eliminating gun-free zones near schools.

The list of Trump flip-flops is long and includes his positions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his regard for Hillary Clinton’s performance as secretary of state. Voters, especially those conservatives who want a clear sense of what their standard-bearer will do as president, deserve explanations for these shifts.

How rich is he?

Throughout his life Trump has cited his wealth as evidence of his excellence but without offering verifiable proof of his claims. In the 1970s he cruised Manhattan in a chauffeured limousine and gave others the impression that he was in control of the $200 million fortune amassed by his father.

In the 1980s, when he first made it onto the Forbes magazine list of America’s wealthiest men and women, Trump complained often and loudly about how his holdings were underestimated. More recently he said he is worth some $10 billion.

The record produced by those who have looked closely at Trump’s finances raises many questions. Writer Wayne Barrett reported in the 1980s that Trump’s income as of 1978 was less than $100,000. In the 1993 biography of Trump called “Lost Tycoon,” Harry Hurt III noted that during his divorce from his first wife, Ivana, her attorneys found that Trump had never been worth the billions of dollars he claimed. Hurt also reported that in March 1992, Trump’s own lawyers said he could not afford to pay Ivana even half of the $20 million he had offered as a settlement.

More recently doubts about his wealth arose in 2005 when journalist Tim O’Brien wrote that Trump was probably worth between $150 million and $250 million. For a man who reveled in his image as a billionaire, O’Brien’s estimate was too much to bear. Trump sued. The case was dismissed by the trial judge. Trump appealed. He lost.

Were Trump a more circumspect and well-mannered man, who never bragged about how rich he is, his wealth would be less of an issue. However Trump has made his fortune such an important part of his identity that voters deserve to know the truth. Many of the facts are contained in Trump’s personal income tax filings, and it is now a campaign tradition for candidates to make these documents public. Clinton has made public all of her returns going back to 2000.

So far, Trump has refused to release his returns because, he says, he is undergoing an audit on returns filed in the last few years. Nothing in the law, or in federal regulations, would prohibit him from making the documents public now, but if he is uncomfortable with releasing those forms, he could simply match Clinton for those years that are settled.

Such a release would reassure the public that Trump is who he says he is – a really rich man – and allow a glimpse into other matters, including his charitable giving. It is a matter of conservative orthodoxy that the rich should be spared excessive taxation so they can support society freely with their philanthropy.

Is he a man of character?

Personality, which can be seen in a smile, heard in a glib remark or felt when viewing a performance, is not the most important measure of a man or woman. Many people with winning personalities are, in fact, hucksters, con men, manipulators and deceivers. In fact, the false signals flashed by well-practiced performers, including politicians, compel us to look for the signs of the character beneath the personality.

Experts in assessing character generally look for some traits such as autonomy and life purpose that Trump clearly possesses in abundance. But there are other areas of character, including positive relations with others, ethical behavior, empathy, honesty and humility where Trump would not achieve a very high score.

In his long and very public life, Trump has often shown he is willing to do things others consider wrong in order to get what he wants. This includes using a false identity to make claims about his success, carrying out a bitter divorce dispute in the tabloid press, criticizing the appearance of others and refusing to take the high road when offered the chance.

The most troubling aspect of Trump’s character can be seen in his devotion to the so-called birther campaign that sought to delegitimize President Barack Obama. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, birthers led by Trump insisted that some mystery surrounded Obama’s status as a citizen born in the United States.

Long after documents were produced to settle this falsely posed question, Trump continued to raise doubts and thus signal his allegiance to those who considered the President to be an unworthy “other.” The racism latent in the birther movement was documented in a study by University of Delaware psychologist Eric Heyman, but the link to prejudice was always plain to see. Rather than stand against birtherism, Trump built a following by exploiting it.

In fact, one can find precedent for Trump’s birtherism in his previous provocative statements about racially sensitive subjects. Other evidence of his character can be found in his selective use of facts, his tendency to inflame conflict rather than cool it and his devotion to self-promotion.

In basketball, a pivot requires planting one foot firmly and swinging the other to change direction. In politics, it usually means shifting from the red-meat style and substance that wins over the party faithful to a more moderate approach to capture the general election.

When the shocking news of Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing hit Saturday night, my mind raced back to a White House Correspondents Association dinner seven years ago, when we were seated together.

David Axelrod

We bantered about my hometown of Chicago, where he had taught law before ascending to the bench. He opined on wine and music and generally lived up to his reputation as a man who told and enjoyed a good story.

And then our conversation took an unexpected turn.

Justice David Souter, Scalia’s longtime colleague on the court, had just announced his retirement, creating a vacancy for President Obama to fill. Scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president, I might have some influence on the decision – or at least enough to pass along a message.

“I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation,” said Scalia, then in his 23rd year as the court’s leading and most provocative conservative voice. “But I hope he sends us someone smart.”

A little taken aback that he was engaging me on the subject, I searched for the right answer, and lamely offered one that signaled my slight discomfort with the topic. “I’m sure he will, Justice Scalia.”

He wasn’t done. Leaning forward, as if to share a confidential thought, he tried again.

“Let me put a finer point on it,” the justice said, in a lower, purposeful tone of voice, his eyes fixed on mine. “I hope he sends us Elena Kagan.”

I was surprised that a member of the court would so bluntly propose a nominee, and intrigued that it was Kagan, the former Harvard Law School dean who was appointed solicitor general by Obama to represent the government before the Supreme Court. Though she had worked on policy in the Clinton administration and had a reputation for pragmatism, Kagan plainly would be a liberal in the context of the court.

Later, I learned that Scalia and Kagan were friends, though I suspect she would have been as surprised as I was at the brazenness of Scalia’s suggestion.

Each was a graduate of Harvard Law School and had taught at the University of Chicago Law School, though in different eras. They were of different generations, he the son of an Italian immigrant, she a Jew from New York City’s left-leaning West Side. But they shared an intellectual rigor and a robust sense of humor. And if Scalia could not have a philosophical ally in the next court appointee, he had hoped, at least, for one with the heft to give him a good, honest fight.

Kagan didn’t get that nomination. The President instead chose Sonia Sotomayor, who would become the first Hispanic member of the Supreme Court.

But when another vacancy arose a year later with the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, Obama did nominate Kagan, whose friendship with Scalia would grow in the years to come, even as they differed, sometimes sharply, on issues before them.

During her confirmation meetings with senators, Kagan had vowed to go hunting to allay their concerns about her cultural awareness on the issue of guns. When she joined the court, she asked her friend, Scalia, to take her. The two, who occasionally shot intellectual darts at each other on paper, became regular, if unlikely, hunting partners.

The Supreme Court is a singular institution in our system: lifetime appointees, powerful in their impact but uniquely opaque in their process of arriving at decisions.

We have become inured to the animus that characterizes the relationship between many of our elected officials in these highly partisan times. But members of the court, free from the pressures of running for office, relate to each other in a different way.

So much so that a conservative lion would lobby the President’s adviser for his liberal friend. Thank you, Justice Scalia, for your service to our country.

Story highlights It wasn't an accident that the billionaire claimed that he didn't know about David Duke, writes Michael D'Antonio Trump was questioned about the white supremacist 48 hours before primaries in Southern states, D'Antonio notes

Editor’s Note: Michael D’Antonio is the author of the new book “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success” (St. Martin’s Press) and is due to be a guest on “CNN Newsroom” Monday in the 10 a.m. hour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.



(CNN) —

Given a straighforward opportunity to disavow the most dangerous brand of hatred in American history, the man who has declared, “I’m, like, a really smart person” couldn’t do it.

“I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,” said Donald Trump in a response to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “So I don’t know. I don’t know – did he endorse me, or what’s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.”

Toni Raiten-D'Antonio Michael D'Antonio

The statement was classic Trump: a chopped salad made out of words. But the two parts were clear. “I know nothing about David Duke,” he said. “I know nothing about white supremacists.” (Trump later tweeted a disavowal.)

Every literate American adult, and certainly anyone running for president, must know that Duke is the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and that white supremacists promote a violently racist ideology that plagues America.

The 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, including 21 kids in a daycare center, was associated with if not inspired by white supremacy.

Since 9/11 white supremacists and other domestic terrorists have carried out more deadly attacks on American soil than Muslim extremists. It was a white supremacist who killed nine people at a Bible study at a Charleston, South Carolina, church last summer.

Concern about racist support for Trump arose last week when David Duke said on Facebook that he liked Trump’s stands on certain issues and the way the candidate exposed “lies” perpetrated by the press and believed he will ensure “that White-Americans are allowed to preserve and promote their heritage and interests just as all other groups are allowed to do.”

When first informed of Duke’s support on Friday, Trump didn’t have any trouble recognizing the name. “David Duke endorsed me?” he said. “OK, all right. I disavow, OK?” This makes sense, given the fact that Duke is notorious for hate-mongering and Trump named him years ago when he explained why he dropped out of the old Reform Party. Back then, and again on Friday, he knew who Duke was and seemed to recognize that he’s political poison.

Trump’s tune changed 48 hours before polls would open for Super Tuesday primaries, many of them in Southern states. Suddenly he was unable to place Duke’s name and he didn’t know a thing about the movement that keeps white racist extremism alive in America.

This from a fellow who is famous for recalling every detail of every deal he ever made and who never forgets those who offend him. If Duke was so bad that his presence drove Trump out of the Reform Party, it’s unlikely he’s forgotten him.

What’s going on here? As someone who has spent many hours with Trump and devoted two years to piecing together the story of his life, I can tell you that Trump is not speaking out of ignorance. He is, as he says, “very smart,” and he understands the effects of what he says. And he has been signaling where he stands when it comes to race for many years.

Before declaring for president, Trump spent much of the Obama presidency as the loudest voice of the “birthers” who repeatedly claimed that Barack Obama was born, not in Hawaii, as documents prove, but abroad. And therefore he was not a U.S. citizen, and not a legitimate president, in Trump’s eyes.

Birtherism was a barely disguised effort to paint the first black president as an un-American other and was energized by racial animus. Trump played the game long after others disavowed it and went further, suggesting the President might not be a Christian, as he says, but perhaps instead a Muslim.

The insinuation, like Trump’s suggestion that the truth about Obama’s college years was somehow clouded, was a divisive kind of gutter politics.

Always comfortable going further than others, Trump was the man who responded to the arrest of five minority youths in the 1989 assault of a jogger in New York’s Central Park with newspaper ads that said, “Bring Back The Death Penalty, Bring Back the Police.”

When Trump and I discussed the five – who were coerced into false confessions but eventually cleared of the crime – he wasn’t interested in discussing any part of it except for his belief that they were bad characters who deserved no consideration for the years they spent in prison.

The Trump record on race also includes the ridiculous assertion, made in a TV interview with Bryant Gumbel, that “A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market.”

Trump also appeared as a witness at a congressional hearing on Indian casinos – they were his competitors – and said, “Organized crime is rampant on Indian reservations.” He then offered his belief that Native Americans at the hearing where he spoke “don’t look like Indians to me, and they don’t look like Indians to Indians.”

Trump’s tendency to play with racial fire is a longstanding element of his style and personality. When he was a marginal political figure, no one dwelled much on this problem. But as he lurches toward the Republican nomination for president, it’s important to understand that he always knows what he is saying and always acts with an intention in mind. He is, after all, a really smart person.

Donald Trump brings out the worst in people,"Story highlights Trump and Sanders offer simplistic and demagogic solutions to our problems, writes Frida Ghitis The campaign echoes the 1930s, she writes Trump appeals to our worst instincts; Sanders is running honorable but mistaken campaign, Ghitis says

Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) —

It’s too bad Superman is not running for president of the United States; this would have been his year. Americans, as we have discovered, are angry, frustrated, disillusioned – and yearning for a savior.

This happened before, almost a century ago in Europe. It was a time of despair; a time when the old models didn’t seem to be working, when the world was changing in confusing ways, and hyperconfident individuals proposed a way out by blaming scapegoats and promising exciting, almost miraculous change. The results proved catastrophic.

No, America is not 1930s Germany, not by a long shot. But the images of Europe after World War I keep coming to mind. The parallels are not precise, but we hear the echoes, see the shadows. We should heed the warnings.

Who would have thought that in the 21st century, American voters would be seriously considering as presidential candidates a neofascist and a neosocialist – throwbacks to the old, failed utopias? Talk about fashionably retro!

Looking at Donald Trump stoking his supporters into a frenzy, attacking “them” – whoever “they” happen to be at the moment – vowing to return American to greatness and then flashing his self-satisfied smile, the mind harks back to those grainy newsreel images of Benito Mussolini, the theatrical Italian “Duce,” the leader, who became the central figure of fascist Italy a century ago.

Is Trump a fascist? No, not quite. In fact, Trump doesn’t propose anything close to a coherent ideology. He’s a Trumpist. And we’re only learning what that means, along with him, as he makes it up.

Fascists viewed the nation as an organism superseding the needs of the individual. That does not match Trump’s rhetoric. But fascists also ridiculed and suppressed the opposition, and they embraced a level of authoritarianism that we can only hope Trump would reject. But who knows?

Cult of personality

One distinct similarity between Trump and the populist politicians of the 1930s is his ability to create and draw power from a cult of personality. The Republican front-runner’s main campaign platform is that he will make everything OK. Trump will fix it. Trump will make America great again. How? That’s not clear. He will do it by the power of his Trumpness. And we know it will work because look at him; look at how successful he is. Look how strong and fearless he is. There’s very little in the way of substance. There’s just a lot of Trump.

And to prove how much America needs him, he reminds voters that America is in deep, deep trouble. He hints at nefarious conspiracies; he highlights every problem and every threat, making it sound as ominous as possible. And then he vows to tackle it without mercy, even if it means committing war crimes, violating the Constitution, and expelling millions of people from the country. That, incidentally, would create the digital color version of those 1930s deportations: armed U.S. security forces (very armed) leading frightened people to the trains. (Or would he make them walk across the border?)

Charisma is a dangerous power in the wrong hands. When combined with popular discontent and disorienting change it can make a travesty of democracy and it can disfigure a society.

Validating prejudices

Trump has an uncanny ability to bring out the worst instincts in people. He validates the prejudices that people try to erase from their hearts. Trump seems alarmingly reluctant to distance himself from support from the KKK. Instead of debating ideas and policies, Trump insults and mocks people. He routinely appears to advocate violence against protesters, another disturbing throwback to the 1930s, and he draws a sharp distinction between “us” and “them.”

We don’t know what kind of a president he would be. It’s hard to imagine he would continue to speak of punching people in the face, or that he would continue to mock people with disabilities, or follow through with any of his illegal or nonsensical proposals as a head of state. But there’s no telling. He has already defied all predictions.

In a new turn of events since Thursday’s GOP debate, Trump’s opponents, who had seemed intimidated by Trump’s savaging of Jeb Bush, have finally decided to take him on. It’s good to see them challenging his empty offerings, but it’s unsettling to see Sen. Marco Rubio also resorting to personality-driven attacks, eliciting uproarious laughter from his supporters. Despite the laughs, it’s a sad sight.

Sanders found a scapegoat

Then there’s the other end of the political spectrum: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the longtime Independent socialist politician now running as a Democrat.

Sanders is no 1930s Marxist. He is not advocating the takeover by the state of the means of production and the abolition of private property. But in the spirit of his socialist convictions, he too has found a scapegoat for all that ails America. Sanders would squeeze the rich, for whom he does not hide his contempt. In the manner of a demagogue, he declared, “Fraud is the business model of Wall Street.”

Sanders proposes social programs containing the seed of potentially useful ideas, and he undoubtedly points to very real flaws in the system. But his overall approach, if it could ever be implemented, has the makings of an economic disaster. We know that because it was already tried.

Hillary Clinton’s overwhelming victory in South Carolina may mark the beginning of the end for the Sanders movement, perhaps a sign that voters know Sanders’ idealistic offerings, no matter how appealing, are disconnected from what is possible.

His plans would create deficits so large that there are not enough zeroes in calculator displays to hold them. His plans would produce deficits of between $18 trillion to $30 trillion (with a T) from new spending. You can squeeze the Wall Street billionaires as hard as you want. Even they don’t have that much money. And while you’re at it, see what happens to the economy if you impose the taxes required to even start those programs.

Sanders running honorable but mistaken campaign

Both Trump and Sanders are advocating granting much greater powers to the government. To be sure, Sanders appears to be aiming to force discussion of important issues in the campaign, and, unlike Trump, has run an honorable, throughtful and respectful campaign.

Trump would apparently expand government to secure the country from enemies and from immigrants. Sanders would do it to pay for social plans. Both positions carry a faint whiff of Nirvana, telling voters who feel unsettled – by growing inequality, expensive unwon wars, and a sense that America is starting to fall behind – that they have an answer to repair the country, to make them feel safe.

Again, this is not Europe in the 1930s, but the European experience carries a warning: Beware of politicians offering easy fixes. Rousing speeches are no guarantee of a better future.

When Europe came under the sway of utopian ideologies, the children of European immigrants living in the United States created Superman. By then, the world desperately needed a superhero.

Do we need more fake holidays? (Opinion),"Editor’s Note: J.J. McCullough is an editorial cartoonist and writer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

Thursday is National Granola Bar Day (and National Hug Day). Saturday is even better: National Pie Day. And next Friday it’s National Puzzle Day.

I don’t know about you, but it seems like in the last couple of years we’ve been getting more and more “holidays” that we’ve never heard of. To name just a few: Raccoon Appreciation Day, National Oreo Cookie Day, Ninja Day and National Hat Day. At least on International Coffee Day, designated September 29, the flurry of social media zingers included free coffee at places such as Dunkin’ Donuts and Krispy Kreme.

You might be tempted to think there’s way too many phony-baloney faux holidays cooked up by people with way too much time on their hands. But, frankly, I think we need a lot more. Here are my nominees.

Is the First Amendment safe from Donald Trump?,"Story highlights If elected, Trump could veto a bill that aims to curb nuisance lawsuits, says Marc Randazza Trumps could appoint Supreme Court justices hostile to a free press, Randazza writes Our democracy depends on robust free speech, Randazza says

Editor’s Note: Marc J. Randazza is a Las Vegas-based First Amendment attorney and managing partner of the Randazza Legal Group. Follow him on Twitter: @marcorandazza. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) —

Donald Trump has said a lot of strange things – some funny, some creepy, but none scarier than what he said on Friday: that if he is elected president, he will “open up our libel laws” to make it easier to sue the media and “win lots of money.” No matter what you may think about his other policy ideas, if he keeps this promise, we won’t be able to effectively express dissent against anything else he might want to do. We can fight any bad policy if we have a robust First Amendment.

Marc Randazza

Some say that Trump is just being a blowhard, that he doesn’t know what he is talking about, and that for all his bluster, there is nothing he could or would do.

I am not so sure. Trump has a history of filing SLAPP suits. SLAPP stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. This describes a lawsuit filed against someone for exercising his or her First Amendment rights – filed with little chance of success, but with the knowledge that the lawsuit itself is the punishment. After all, if people have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves because they criticized Donald Trump, they might think better of doing so again in the future.

However, some states, like California and Nevada, have strong anti-SLAPP laws, which dispense with such cases early and force the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s attorneys’ fees. (Full disclosure: I was instrumental in urging passage of the Nevada Anti-SLAPP law.)

Trump recently got stung with an anti-SLAPP decision, which he probably had in mind when he spoke about “opening up” our libel laws. In fact, he isn’t the first big shot to try to make it easier to sue for defamation after having a SLAPP suit blow up in his face.

Therefore, Trump is clearly frustrated with anti-SLAPP laws (which shows that they work) and the landmark defamation case, New York Times v. Sullivan.

When people say that Trump can’t do anything about defamation law at the federal level, I think they miss the point that there is a lot of support for a federal anti-SLAPP law. I think we need one, and in fact, HR 2304 was one such proposal this last session. If it passes, we could expect President Trump to veto it.

Beyond new federal legislation, defamation law is a matter of state law, leaving little for a president to do about it. To win a defamation case, the plaintiff must show publication of a false statement of fact that damages the plaintiff’s reputation. This standard can vary a bit from state to state, but it generally fits that general set of requirements.

Therefore, what could Trump do to “open up” the libel laws? He personally? Nothing legally, but if elected, he could pick Supreme Court justices willing to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan, which is in my view the most important case protecting our First Amendment rights. It is the greatest protection we have from government officials or powerful businesses choking the life out of public debate and a free press. Overturning it would change everything we know about freedom of the press.

In a defamation case involving an ordinary citizen suing for defamation, the citizen only needs to show that the defendant knew the statement was false, or failed to exercise “reasonable care” before publishing it. So let’s say that a blogger writes an article about a private citizen accusing that person of a crime, based on a false statement by a witness, without following up. That might be a failure to exercise reasonable care, and the blogger might lose the case.

But if the same blogger wrote one about a public figure, like Trump, then Trump has to prove that the blogger did so with “actual malice.”

Even some judges and lawyers get this wrong, so don’t feel bad if you didn’t know what “actual malice” means. It has nothing to do with “malice” at all. It means that the defendant published the statement knowing it was false or with a reckless disregard for the truth.

So if we return to my example, let’s say someone wrote a blog post about Donald Trump, accusing him of a crime, but based it just on an anonymous email, without following up – that might be considered to be “reckless disregard.”

Why the different standard depending on the plaintiff?

From New York Times v. Sullivan: “(W)e consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”

How beautiful that language is. It encapsulates what America is all about, the way only Justice William Brennan could.

Debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open… Justice William Brennan

The court recognized that public figures have access to the media to defend themselves, and it went on to reject any notion that the speaker must prove truth; instead the plaintiff must prove falsity. This is all because the First Amendment needs “breathing space” in order for free speech to survive. And if we impose liability for merely erroneous reports on political conduct, it would reflect the “obsolete doctrine that the governed must not criticize their governors.”

So what if Trump appoints one or two Supreme Court judges who are willing to overturn Sullivan? Justice Elena Kagan has already voiced skepticism about the extension of Sullivan too far into other kinds of libel cases. The only member of the court I think we could count on to be strongly opposed to overturning it is Chief Justice John Roberts.

No matter how flawed it is, our democracy depends upon robust free speech and free press rights. New York Times v. Sullivan matters more than anything else. If we lose the right to criticize the government in wide-open and robust debate, we lose an important part of what it means to be free.

Which generation has it worse? (Opinion),"On November 30, 1965, about 20,000 marchers protested in Washington against American involvement in the Vietnam War. Those who were born in 1945 were on the tail end of the ""greatest generation,"" and some participated in anti-war rallies in their youth.

Editor’s Note: Generation whining has become nearly a national pastime. Millennials say they have it the worst. Generation X feels neglected. Baby boomers are tired of being called narcissistic. In articles and cartoons everywhere – from CNN to The New York Times to Gizmodo and beyond – critics call out this generation’s sense of entitlement, that generation’s self-absorption. We invited writers, activists and CNN contributors from different generations to hash it out.

I belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We’re the cohort everyone skips over — the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.

Yet, despite our generation’s small size and overlooked status, we’ve nevertheless been handed the job of being America’s cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we’re raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution. In return, the world called us slackers. Is there any wonder we’re bitter?

Sixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire, “The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history.”

Nearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I’d like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever.

Dirck Halstead/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images Paul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.

In the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds – in blood and treasure – has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women’s rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)

I’m at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.

Dasha Burns: Millennials have an existential crisis

Don’t hate us – we’re just confused. We’ve seemingly made “changing the world” with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world – we’re upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).

Dasha Burns Dasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.

But in dismantling old models, we’re also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It’s harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won’t necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.

This is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.

Of course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.

We’re faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.

So, take some pity on us when you’re judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it’s that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn’t sit right.

We’re the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.

Pepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation

For me, it’s a tale of two cities.

One city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women’s liberation.

Courtesy of Pepper Schwartz Pepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.

Most of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights – we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.

But there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a “cocktail,” general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.

Our generation was mixed. But I’ve been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.

Story highlights Helen Prejean: Antonin Scalia's position on death penalty flouted Catholic teaching and hewed to archaic ideas on mental disability

Editor’s Note: Sister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of “Dead Man Walking.” The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) —

I’m praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.

As I was writing “The Death of Innocents,” I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was “taking him on” in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, “And I’ll be right back at ya!”

In “Innocents,” I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O’Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams, whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the “machinery of death.”

Scalia’s experience of the “meaning” of capital punishment, as he described it in one of his dissenting opinions, couldn’t have been more different from my own. In the marble confines of the court, he argued interpretation of Constitutional texts, while I, in state killing chambers, accompanied real human beings – six of them – to their deaths, which were a direct result of Scalia’s interpretations.

In grasping the “meaning” of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.

One thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his “originalist” approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.

After all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal “experts,” every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?

I have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.

As for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.

Given what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that’s an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.

In 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.

I say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie’s guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie’s story in”The Death of Innocents,” taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.

Three years after Dobie’s death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented. In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities – that is with an IQ of 70 and below – violates the Eighth Amendment’s ban on “cruel and unusual punishments.”

In his dissent, Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary’s definition of “idiot” as “such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is.” According to Scalia’s perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court’s decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia’s “idiot” test.

My second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.

These stalwart teachers, he maintained – unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by “modern trends,” as he saw it – upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God’s will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.

Thus, Scalia could not brook American bishops’ increasing opposition to the death penalty, nor the opposition of Popes John Paul II and Francis – especially Pope Francis, who must have disturbed the justice considerably in his bold appeal before Congress for global abolition of the death penalty.

At a conference in Chicago in 2002, Scalia’s statements about Christian faith vis a vis the death penalty stunned me. Statements such as these:

– “It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States.”

– He interpreted St. Paul’s words, “The powers that be are ordained of God,” to mean: “Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. …These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times … regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy.”

Democracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That’s theocracy, not democracy.

Where was Jesus in the Justice’s stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking “an eye for an eye,” to pray for and forgive our enemies?

In Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus’ call to forgive, but not the state.

In this distorted reading, state governments as God’s ministers have God’s blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem “enemy.”

It seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.

I also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people – especially the most vulnerable among us for whom “equal justice under law” is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.

(CNN) —

Dear Ted,

How are you? It must be so exhausting running for President. I hope you’re taking good care of yourself.

I happened to be flipping through the channels on Thursday night when I saw you talking to Donald Trump at the Republican debate about what you called “New York values.” I wasn’t sure at first what you meant, but then you explained: “I think most people know exactly what New York values are: socially liberal, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, focused on money and the media.”

For a moment I actually thought Mr. Trump was speechless, but duh, he’s a New Yorker like me, and nobody cherishes the First Amendment more than us!

Anyway, it’s a new day.

And I just took a car service home from my fiance’s apartment on the Upper East Side. I’m pretty sure you’re familiar with the UES. It’s in Manhattan on the opposite side of Central Park where you had that fundraiser at those two gay guys’ apartment in April? I hope that while you were here, you and your wife had time to visit the Goldman Sachs’ headquarters to thank them for that big loan they gave you.

I bet you saw the building as your plane was landing; it’s one of those huge towers downtown by ground zero. Maybe you didn’t have enough time, since you never know how the traffic is going to be on the George Washington Bridge when you’re driving in from the airport.

I live on the Upper West Side and my girlfriend and I are planning to get married as soon as we can find a big enough apartment to comfortably fit all four of us (two kids included). Both our apartments are rent stabilized, so we’re taking our time finding the right place. If you’re not familiar with the rent laws in New York, you should check them out.

In 1997, our Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, extended rent regulation laws after a big to-do with Republican State Sen. Joseph L. Bruno, who wanted them eliminated. Thank goodness, our mayor had two important allies: Republican State Sens. Roy Goodman of Manhattan and Frank Padavan of Queens, who both agreed with the Democratic-controlled State Assembly.

Have you ever been to Queens, Ted? It’s the most racially diverse county in the contiguous United States. My favorite Greek restaurant is in Astoria. Do you like Greek food? It’s yummy. Asghar, my driver, and I were talking about how many great places there are to eat here in NYC. He was born in Pakistan, and moved here as a baby. He married a woman from Colombia and their two kids are just beautiful, and get this – they’re also tri-lingual! They speak English, Urdu and Spanish. I must admit that I’m a little jealous about that.

Hey, I heard that you are a huge fan of “The Princess Bride.” Me, too!! Did you know that they are talking about bringing it to Broadway? That would be so amazing, because William Goldman wrote the book right here in NYC!

Have you seen any Broadway shows recently? I think you would just LOVE “Hamilton.” Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote it and it’s very historical. He’s from Washington Heights and he’s so talented. I’m warning you that it’s hard to get tickets, but I’m sure you have some “in” somewhere. And check out “Kinky Boots” and “Fun Home” if you can. You won’t be sorry!

I wish I had more time to write, but I have so much to do. I’m going to probably take a Citi Bike (a great way to get around Manhattan, btw), over to the Museum Of Modern Art to get a ticket to the Picasso exhibit.

And then I’m going to take the subway to my son’s basketball game over at his public high school near Times Square. Have you ever taken the subway? It’s fast, convenient and safe (as you know, New York is America’s safest big city), plus I get lots of reading done there.

After the game we’ll probably get something to eat since he’s always so hungry. Sometimes we order in from our favorite neighborhood restaurants, but it’s always a struggle which one to pick! Vietnamese, Korean, Peruvian, Greek, Japanese, Italian, Middle Eastern, Indian, deli, pizza – so much to choose from! Thank goodness The New York Times has that wonderful food section every Wednesday; it gives us so many ideas. It’s actually my favorite section after Tuesday’s Science Times. Do you read the NYTimes?

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this. Good luck getting your word out to the American people.

Oh, and we actually have a word we use for you here in New York. Schmuck. You might hear it if you ever have the chutzpah to step foot in NYC again.

'I'm the person they call when people die',"(CNN) —

“Remember: This can only end badly.” That’s what my husband says anytime I start a story. He’s right.

So. This carpenter is sitting on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan with his buddies, half a dozen subcontractors in hard hats sipping their coffees before the morning shift gets started.

The remains of a hurricane blew over the city the day before, halting construction, but now it’s back to business on the office tower they’ve been building for eight months.

As the sun comes up and the traffic din grows, a new noise punctures the hum of taxis and buses: a metallic creak, not immediately menacing.

The creak turns into a groan, and somebody yells.

Judy Melinek

The workers can’t hear too well over the diesel noise and gusting wind, but they can tell the voice is directed at them. The groan sharpens to a screech. The men look up – then jump to their feet and sprint off, their coffee flying everywhere. The carpenter chooses the wrong direction.

With an earthshaking crash, the derrick of a 383-foot-tall construction crane slams down on James Friarson’s head. I arrived at this gruesome scene two hours later with a team of MLIs, medicolegal investigators from the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner.

The crane had fallen directly across a busy intersection at rush hour and the police had shut it down, snarling traffic in all directions.

The MLI driving the morgue van cursed like a sailor as he inched us the last few blocks to the cordon line. Medicolegal investigators are the medical examiner’s first responders, going to the site of an untimely death, examining and documenting everything there, and transporting the body back to the city morgue for autopsy.

I was starting a monthlong program designed to introduce young doctors to the world of forensic death investigation and had never worked outside a hospital.

01:39 - Source: CNN He's collected nearly 13,000 bodies

“Doc,” the MLI behind the wheel said to me at one hopelessly gridlocked corner, “I hope you don’t turn out to be a black cloud. Yesterday all we had to do was scoop up one little old lady from Beth Israel ER.” Today, we get this.”

“Watch your step,” a police officer warned when I got out of the van. The steel boom had punched a foot-deep hole in the sidewalk when it came down on Friarson. A hard hat was still there, lying on its side in a pool of blood and brains, coffee and doughnuts.

I had spent the previous four years training as a hospital pathologist in a fluorescent-lit world of sterile labs and blue scrubs. Now I found myself at a windy crime scene in the middle of Manhattan rush hour, gore on the sidewalk, blue lights and yellow tape, in a crowd of gawkers and grim cops.

I was hooked.

I’m not a ghoulish person. I’m a guileless, sunny optimist, in fact. When I first started training in death investigation, my husband, T.J., worried my new job would change the way I looked at the world. He feared that after a few months of hearing about the myriad ways New Yorkers die, the two of us would start looking up nervously for window air conditioners to fall on our heads.

Maybe we’d steer our toddler son’s stroller around sidewalk grates instead of rolling over them. We would, he was sure, never again set foot in murderous Central Park. “You’re going to turn me into one of those crazy people who leaves the house wearing a surgical mask and gloves,” T.J. declared during a West Nile virus scare.

Instead, my experience had the opposite effect—it freed us from our six o’clock news phobias.

Once I became an eyewitness to death, I found that nearly every unexpected fatality I investigated was either the result of something dangerously mundane, or of something predictably hazardous.

01:26 - Source: CNN 'This is the only thing to show for his life'

So don’t jaywalk. Wear your seat belt when you drive. Better yet, stay out of your car and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker, stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start.

Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad. You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It’s there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Mostly. As I would also learn at the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, undetected anatomical defects do occasionally cause otherwise healthy people to drop dead.

One-in-a-million fatal diseases crop up, and New York has eight million people. There are open manholes. Stray bullets. There are crane accidents.

“I don’t understand how you can do it,” friends—even fellow physicians—tell me. But all doctors learn to objectify their patients to a certain extent. You have to suppress your emotional responses or you wouldn’t be able to do your job. In some ways it’s easier for me, because a dead body really is an object, no longer a person at all. More important, that dead body is not my only patient.

The survivors are the ones who really matter. I work for them too.

Goodbye to ‘he’ and ‘she’ and hello to ‘ze’?,"Story highlights John McWhorter says it's difficult to make the transition, but there's a good argument to replace gender-based pronouns He says ""he"" and ""she"" could be replaced with ""ze"" or ""they""

Editor’s Note: John McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of “The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language.” The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) —

Language changes with the times, and when it comes to our conceptions of gender, the times are most certainly changing.

We are opening up to the idea that binary conceptions of gender are unnecessarily rigid and don’t correspond to the self-image of a great many people, and even that people’s sense of their gender may not correspond to their biological sex. In this new world, a bland opposition between “he” and “she” seems increasingly antique, and even insulting, to many.

However, doing something about that is going to be a challenge. We are dealing not with merely giving new names to new things or actions, which is easy, but with using new pronouns, which is very hard.

John McWhorter

This is hard because human cognition makes some parts of language more resistant to change than others. Nouns, verbs and adjectives, for example, are like software. It feels natural to add them, subtract them, revise them.

We expect them to change from era to era – of course we now have blogs and twerking when we didn’t 20 years ago; of course young people now call “fierce” what their equivalents long ago called “keen,” “neat,” “wicked,” “rad,” and so on. They are what linguists call open class words.

Pronouns, however, are closed class words. As shorthand for any thing or concept, pronouns are used so often and so unconsciously that they are more like hardware. A new object or practice is one thing – but a new “you” or a new “him” or “her”?

It’s harder to wrap our minds around changing something so cognitively fundamental, just as one does not pop up with new prepositions: You might wish there were a little word to indicate “on as in upside down on a ceiling, rather than on a wall or floor.” But if you made one up it wouldn’t catch on – nouns and verbs are lightbulbs; prepositions are the wiring inside the walls.

Six-thousand years ago, in the ancestor of most of today’s European languages on the Ukranian steppes, while most of the language would have seemed like Hittite to us (because it sort of was!), its speakers were using pronouns that sounded roughly like “me,” “you,” and “we” (not to mention the “tu” familiar from French and Spanish). That’s how hardy pronouns are.

This is why previous attempts to fashion gender-neutral pronouns haven’t caught on (believe it or not, there were once calls for the blend hesh!), and why as clever as today’s “ze” is, its evolution from in-house tradition to society-wide acceptance will be slow at least, and possibly ill-fated. Bias alone will play its part, surely, but even without it, new pronouns require a mental effort analogous to conceiving dimensions beyond the third.

If anglophones are to accept new pronouns for new times, two things will be necessary. For example, the truth is that one thing that helps people change their pronoun usage is shame. For example, of all the “blackboard grammar” rules that English speakers are schooled in, such as that two negatives mean a positive or that one must say fewer books rather than less books, only one has truly caught on to the extent that it is part of the grammar actual people use comfortably. It is the rule stipulating that one must say “Billy and I went to the store” rather than “Billy and me,” because me is “wrong” as a subject.

This is a rule no one imposed on English until a couple hundred years ago, and is unheard of in many other languages like French and Swedish. However, for better or for worse, it has been so successfully drilled into our heads as a mark of basic intelligence and propriety.

Now, I would hope that pronouns like “ze” would not be imposed with the knuckle-rapping and contemptuous indignation with which the Billy and I rule has been promulgated. However, there is room for presenting “ze” as a matter not of fashion, but of basic civility – people must think of new pronouns as the proper thing to do, not as a stunt.

To the extent that societies change their pronoun usage, it tends to involve recasting old pronouns, or even expressions, into new functions. European languages like French, for example, use the plural “vous” to address a single person with respect. Spanish’s respectful “usted” began as “your mercy,” “vuestra merced,” not as a brand new little word imposed by fiat. In this light, our own “they” could be handy as a new way to address people gender-neutrally. Many have called for exactly this.

And not just recently – English speakers have been using “they” in the singular for eons. In starchy old “Vanity Fair,” William Thackeray writes “A person can’t help their birth.” Today, we spontaneously use sentences such as “Tell each student they should hand in the paper on Tuesday.” However, this is another of those things that we are told is a mark of ignorance because “they is plural.” However, our new times may require that we get past that notion, which shouldn’t be a problem because it has always been absurd.

After all, in French, vous “is plural,” yet no one seems to mind. Once upon a time, you “was plural” while thou was used in the singular. Today, you “is” singular as well and no one bats an eye. In the same way, in our “hardware,” “they” is both singular and plural. Our new conceptions of gender are a good time to get past the conservatism about singular “they.”

The naysayers complain about the prospect of sentences like “They is upstairs,” but this is a distraction: gender-neutral they should be used, as it has been forever, with plural verb forms: “They are upstairs” will mean that one person is upstairs as well as two or more. “But won’t that be confusing?” one may ask – upon which the answer is another question: When have you been confused as to whether “You are my favorite” referred to yourself or yourself and some other people? Context pulls a great deal of weight in how we communicate.

Assessing the prospects of new pronouns like ze and recast pronouns like they, my bet would be on they, in terms of the chances that, in 50 years, everybody is on board and on to the next controversy. What we do know, however, is that we are at a point where anglophones will need to accept some kind of change in how we use the language. Call it a teaching moment –language not only never stops changing, but could not.

Is it ethical to colonize Mars? (Opinion),"NASA's Curiosity rover was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on November 26, 2011. NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover, touched down on the planet on August 6, 2012.

This image shows Curiosity's main science target, ""Mount Sharp."" The rover's shadow can be seen in the foreground. The dark bands in the distances are dunes.

This is one of the first pictures taken by Curiosity after it landed. It shows the rover's shadow on the Martian soil.

This view of the landscape to the north of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity was acquired by the Mars Hand Lens Imager on the first day after landing.

The four main pieces of hardware that arrived on Mars with NASA's Curiosity rover were spotted by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera captured this image about 24 hours after landing.

This image comparison shows a view through a Hazard-Avoidance camera on NASA's Curiosity rover before and after the clear dust cover was removed. Both images were taken by a camera at the front of the rover. ""Mount Sharp,"" the mission's ultimate destination, looms ahead.

This first image taken by the Navigation cameras on Curiosity shows the rover's shadow on the surface of Mars.

This color full-resolution image showing the heat shield of NASA's Curiosity rover was obtained during descent to the surface of Mars on August 13, 2012. The image was obtained by the Mars Descent Imager instrument known as MARDI and shows the 15-foot diameter heat shield when it was about 50 feet from the spacecraft.

Two blast marks from the descent stage's rockets can be seen in the center of this image. Also seen is Curiosity's left side. This picture is a mosaic of images taken by the rover's navigation cameras.

In this portion of the larger mosaic from the previous frame, the crater wall can be seen north of the landing site, or behind the rover. NASA says water erosion is believed to have created a network of valleys, which enter ""Gale Crater"" from the outside here.

In this portion of the larger mosaic from the previous frame, the crater wall can be seen north of the landing site, or behind the rover. NASA says water erosion is believed to have created a network of valleys, which enter ""Gale Crater"" from the outside here.

This image, taken from the rover's mast camera, looks south of the landing site toward ""Mount Sharp.""

This image, with a portion of the rover in the corner, shows the wall of ""Gale Crater"" running across the horizon at the top of the image.

This image shows what will be the rover's first target with it's chemistry and camera (ChemCam) instrument. The ChemCam will fire a laser at the rock, indicated by the black circle. The laser will cause the rock to emit plasma, a glowing, ionized gas. The rover will then analyze the plasma to determine the chemical composition of the rock.

An updated self-portrait of the Mars rover Curiosity, showing more of the rover's deck. This image is a mosiac compiled from images taken from the navigation camera. The wall of ""Gale Crater,"" the rover's landing site, can be seen at the top of the image.

This composite image, with magnified insets, depicts the first laser test by the Chemistry and Camera, or ChemCam, instrument aboard NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The composite incorporates a Navigation Camera image taken prior to the test, with insets taken by the camera in ChemCam. The circular insert highlights the rock before the laser test. The square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the laser interrogation of the rock.

With the addition of four high-resolution Navigation Camera, or Navcam, images, taken on August 18, 2012. Curiosity's 360-degree landing-site panorama now includes the highest point on ""Mount Sharp"" visible from the rover. Mount Sharp's peak is obscured from the rover's landing site by this highest visible point.

Curiosity moved its robot arm on August 20, 2012, for the first time since it landed on Mars. ""It worked just as we planned,"" said JPL engineer Louise Jandura in a NASA press release. This picture shows the 7-foot-long arm holding a camera, a drill, a spectrometer, a scoop and other tools. The arm will undergo weeks of tests before it starts digging.

NASA tested the steering on its Mars rover Curiosity on August 21, 2012. Drivers wiggled the wheels in place at the landing site on Mars.

The Mars rover Curiosity moved about 15 feet forward and then reversed about 8 feet during its first test drive on August 22, 2012. The rover's tracks can be seen in the right portion of this panorama taken by the rover's navigation camera.

An image released August 27, 2012, was taken with Curiosity rover's 100-millimeter mast camera, NASA says. The image shows ""Mount Sharp"" on the Martian surface. NASA says the rover will go to this area.

Sub-image three shows the descent stage crash site, now in color, and several distant spots (blue in enhanced color) downrange that are probably the result of distant secondary impacts that disturbed the surface dust.

Sub-image two shows the parachute and backshell, now in color. The outer band of the parachute has a reddish color.

Sub-image one of three shows the rover and its tracks after a few short drives. Tracking the tracks will provide information on how the surface changes as dust is deposited and eroded.

The left eye of the Mast Camera on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity took this image of the rover's arm on September 5, 2012.

The penny in this image is part of a camera calibration target on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity. The image was taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager camera.

This view of the three left wheels of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity combines two images that were taken by the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager on September 9, 2012, the 34th day of Curiosity's work on Mars. In the distance is the lower slope of ""Mount Sharp.""

This is the calibration target for the imager. This image, taken on September 9, 2012, shows that the surface of the calibration target is covered with a layor of dust as a result of the landing. The calibration target includes color references, a metric bar graphic, a penny for scale comparison, and a stair-step pattern for depth calibration.

This is the open inlet where powdered rock and soil samples will be funneled down for analysis. The image is made up of eight photos taken on September 11, 2012, by the imager and is used to check that the instrument is operating correctly.

Researchers also used the mast camera to examine the Mars Hand Lens Imager on the rover to inspect its dust cover and check that its LED lights were functional. In this image, taken on September 7, 2012, the imager is in the center of the screen with its LED on. The main purpose of Curiosity's imager camera is to acquire close-up, high-resolution views of rocks and soil from the Martian surface.

Researchers used the Curiosity rover's mast camera to take a photo of the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer. The image was used to see whether it had been caked in dust during the landing.

This image shows the robotic arm of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity with the first rock touched by an instrument on the arm. The photo was taken by the rover's right navigation camera.

Curiosity completed its longest drive to date on September 26, 2012. The rover moved about 160 feet east toward the area known as ""Glenelg."" As of that day the rover had moved about a quarter-mile from its landing site.

NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here. The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team. The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water. The grains are too large to have been moved by wind.

Curiosity cut a wheel scuff mark into a wind-formed ripple at the ""Rocknest"" site on October 3, 2012. This gave researchers a better opportunity to examine the particle-size distribution of the material forming the ripple.

The rover's scoop contains larger soil particles that were too big to filter through a sample-processing sieve. After a full-scoop sample had been vibrated over the sieve, this portion was returned to the scoop for inspection by the rover's mast camera.

This image shows what the rover team has determined to be a piece of debris from the spacecraft, possibly shed during the landing.

The robotic arm on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity delivered a sample of Martian soil to the rover's observation tray for the first time on October 16, 2012.

Three ""bite marks"" made by the rover's scoop can be seen in the soil on Mars surface on October 15, 2012.

The Mars rover Curiosity recorded this view from its left navigation camera after an 83-foot eastward drive on November 18, 2012. The view is toward ""Yellowknife Bay"" in the ""Glenelg"" area of Gale Crater.

Curiosity used a dust-removal tool for the first time to clean this patch of rock on the Martian surface on January 6, 2013.

A view of what NASA describes as ""veined, flat-lying rock."" It was selected as the first drilling site for the Mars rover.

Curiosity's first set of nighttime photos include this image of Martian rock illuminated by ultraviolet lights. Curiosity used the camera on its robotic arm, the Mars Hand Lens Imager, to capture the images on January 22, 2013.

The rover drilled this hole, in a rock that's part of a flat outcrop researchers named ""John Klein,"" during its first sample drilling on February 8, 2013.

Curiosity shows the first sample of powdered rock extracted by the rover's drill. The image was taken by Curiosity's mast camera on February 20, 2013.

The rock on the left, called ""Wopmay,"" was discovered by the rover Opportunity, which arrived in 2004 on a different part of Mars. Iron-bearing sulfates indicate that this rock was once in acidic waters. On the right are rocks from ""Yellowknife Bay,"" where rover Curiosity was situated. These rocks are suggestive of water with a neutral pH, which is hospitable to life formation.

The lower slopes of ""Mount Sharp"" are visible at the top of this image, taken on July 9, 2013. The turret of tools at the end of the rover's arm, including the rock-sampling drill in the lower left corner, can also be seen.

This view of the twilight sky and Martian horizon, taken by Curiosity, includes Earth as the brightest point of light in the night sky. Earth is a little left of center in the image, and our moon is just below Earth. A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright ""evening stars.""

Curiosity took this nighttime photo of a hole it drilled May 5 to collect soil samples. NASA said this image combines eight exposures taken after dark on May 13.

The rover recently encountered this iron meteorite, which NASA named ""Lebanon."" This find is similar in shape and luster to iron meteorites found on Mars by the previous generation of rovers. A portion of the rock was outlined by NASA scientists.

Wheel tracks from Curiosity are seen on the sandy floor of a lowland area dubbed ""Hidden Valley"" in this image.

The Mars rover Curiosity does a test drill on a rock dubbed ""Bonanza King"" to determine whether it would be a good place to dig deeper and take a sample. But after the rock shifted, the test was stopped.

Curiosity has temperature and humidity sensors mounted on its mast. Calculations in 2015 based on Curiosity's measurements indicate that Mars could be dotted with tiny puddles of salty water at night.

The bright blue speck in the middle of this image is NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The image was taken from another NASA spacecraft, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is in orbit above the planet, on June 6, 2017.

Five years ago and 154 million miles away, NASA's Curiosity Mars rover successfully landed on the planet. Take a look back at what the rover has been up to these past five years, including this selfie it took on January 19, 2016.

NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover tweeted out a new image on January 23, 2018: ""I'm back! Did you miss me?"" The selfie is part of a fresh batch of images the rover beamed back from Mars.

Story highlights Brian Green: What is the moral value of native Martian life vs. creating a ""backup Earth""? It would be hubris for us to assume that humanity on Earth would last forever

(CNN) —

With the recent NASA announcement of liquid water flowing on Mars and the movie “The Martian” making a splash at the box office, we might well ask whether humans should go to Mars.

There is almost no chance that Mars has intelligent life and for decades we earthlings have dreamed of living on Mars. But let’s think about this from an ethical point of view. What is the moral value of native Martian life vs. creating a “backup Earth”?

The discovery of native life on Mars – even if it is only the most primitive microbes – would be one of the most important scientific discoveries in human history. Sound improbable? NASA does not think so; in fact, determining if life ever arose on Mars is its first goal for Mars exploration.

Nicole Morales Brian Patrick Green

NASA has evidence from Earth that life can growth in very extreme conditions. These life forms are called extremophiles, and they can survive under high temperature and pressure, endure intense radiation and cold. Life may have evolved eons ago on Mars, and just been driven underground.

Should we respect native Martian life forms if we find them? Most likely they would be microscopic. On Earth, we kill microbes all the time. So is it wrong to go to another planet and mess with the natives? After all, if that had happened to Earth in the past, we might not exist.

How thoroughly do we need to search for life forms before we can declare Mars ours? Should we leave the planet as a preserve if there is native life, or settle down and assume that native life will remain relatively unharmed? Should we intentionally restore the Martian climate by warming the planet and adding water so that whatever life is there may better flourish?

In the absence of proof of life on Mars, this is a philosophical debate. But we may not have the luxury of an exceedingly thorough search for life before humans start to contaminate the planet with Earth life (humans carry a whole microbiome of organisms, after all). There are humans at this moment planning to go to Mars and permanently settle there.

Several organizations have already stated they are going to Mars as soon as possible, and SpaceX’s Elon Musk has been clear on one reason why he thinks it is so important for humans to go to Mars.

Musk believes that living exclusively on Earth is too risky. Humanity is keeping all of its eggs on one planet, and given the natural and human-made risks in the universe that is simply not safe.

The moral value of having a “backup Earth” shouldn’t be underestimated.

You might think – what’s the chance of humans destroying humanity? Look at how far we’ve progressed in the last thousands of years. Sure, we have empires rise and fall, but we won’t destroy ourselves.

But with technological progress making nuclear, biological and chemical weapons easier to obtain (not to mention new risks like artificial intelligence and nanotechnology), and the unintended consequences of climate change, doomsday scenarios are real possibilities in the future. It would be hubris for us to assume that humanity on Earth would last forever.

Now, consider this scenario: a nuclear war or other disaster hits the Earth and human civilization is destroyed. Everything in history – all art, progress, science, technology – is for nothing.

Then consider if the same thing happens, but a small city full of humans – perhaps a few thousand in a self-sustaining settlement on Mars – exists with records of human history, with animals and plants, children and couples.

In the second scenario, despite the horrific disaster on Earth, all of human history is not for nothing. There is still human meaning in the universe. That’s an incredibly morally valuable thing.

It’s clear that the backup Earth project should take priority, even if it is potentially damaging to native life on Mars. We could try to settle on the moon or a large asteroid instead, but as things look, Mars is our best option.

Story highlights David Wheeler: It's finally Back to the Future day and we can see which predictions from the movie came true Luckily, many did not, he says. We don't, for example, have to deal with rehydrating our pizza, sleep inducing gadgets and Jaws 19

(CNN) —

Unless you’ve been living in a nuclear fallout shelter (remember those?), you’re aware that we’re celebrating Back to the Future Day. That’s right, it’s here: The date that Marty McFly and Doc Brown traveled to in the DeLorean in the 1989 Robert Zemeckis film, “Back to the Future Part II.”

Finally we have the rare opportunity to confirm whether a famous movie’s predictions actually came true on a certain day: October 21, 2015.

While the movie nailed certain aspects of our time (including flatscreen TVs, nostalgia for the ‘80s, and even a successful Chicago Cubs season), we can be glad that not all the movie’s predictions came true. We’re definitely better off without the following inventions:

Jaws 19

In a memorable scene, a holographic advertisement for Jaws 19 terrifies Michael J. Fox. In the real-life fourth installment of the shark franchise, “Jaws: The Revenge,” we’re already forced to accept the existence of sharks that roar, sharks that follow people to the Bahamas, and sharks that have vendettas. The tagline for “Jaws 4” was “This time it’s personal.” Which invites the question: What absurdities would we be subjected to in the 19th installment? Sharks that leave a horse’s head in your bed to “send a message”? We’re better off not knowing.

Dehydrated pizza

“Boy, oh, boy, Mom,” Michael J. Fox says to Lea Thompson in BTTF’s version of 2015. “You sure can hydrate a pizza.” But in the real 2015, everybody knows that moisture is the worst thing about microwaving a pizza. To avoid soggy slices, even the busiest and laziest people of 2015 take the extra couple of minutes to warm up a pizza in an oven (toaster or conventional). If you think microwave pizza is bad, you would be sure to hate the Black and Decker food hydrator.

Flying cars

Everybody loves the flying cars in “Back to the Future II,” but did you notice the floating Hill Valley welcome sign? It says, “Please fly safely. Ejection seats save lives.” Ejection seats? You mean I have to parachute to the ground any time I have a fender bender? Just to get to work a couple minutes faster? Thanks — I’ll stick with my old-fashioned terrestrial Toyota.

Sleep-inducing gadgets

In “Back to the Future II,” the filmmakers already anticipate the problem with mass-marketed gadgets that induce sleep. In fact, the movie never once shows the devices being used for their only legitimate purpose: curing insomnia. Instead, they’re used to knock people out and make them forget that something happened. For example, Elisabeth Shue, who plays Marty McFly’s girlfriend (and later wife), asks one too many questions about her future upon entering 2015. Wanting her to think it was all a dream, Doc Brown puts her to sleep with the sleep inducer. Then they leave her in an alley! Not cool.

Imagine being knocked unconscious any time you get too curious about something. Any time you’re an inconvenience to someone. Any time you hear a secret you’re not supposed to hear. Boom, you’re out for hours. People would clearly get carried away and the streets would be strewn with the passed out. Small wonder the EZ Sleep hasn’t made it into reality.

Voice-activated light fixtures

In “Back to the Future II’s” version of 2015, we don’t flip light switches. We say, “Lights on,” and the lights come on at the sound of our voice. But the movie already anticipates the unintended consequence: Any time we happen to use those words in a sentence, the house thinks we’re giving it a command. You couldn’t say, “Honey, can you make sure to turn the lights off before you go to bed.” If you did, the light fixture’s voice-activation system would misunderstand you and turn off the lights prematurely. Maybe it would be better to have some other sound command – say, clapping your hands?

Too late, this invention already exists – remember The Clapper? – and it was already being parodied in the 1980s. Buy one if you want, but it’s hard to improve on a light switch. It works just fine.

Hovering robot photographers

In “Back to the Future II,” automated hovering cameras are so prevalent that they can even be relied upon for news footage, such as when Griff Tannen and his gang of bullies cause a “hoverboard rampage” that destroys the front of the Hill Valley courthouse. Good thing we don’t have to worry about drones taking constant surveillance of our lives … right?

Story highlights S.E. Cupp recalls being the victim of bullying when she moved to a new school in her teens Now, as the mother of a young son, she is thinking about how she will equip him to cope

Editor’s Note: S.E. Cupp is the author of “Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media’s Attack on Christianity,” co-author of “Why You’re Wrong About the Right” and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.

Boston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.

JEREMY FREEMAN/CNN

Until I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.

I’d always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn’t decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I’d ever endured.

The pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally – it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)

The pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It’s why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It’s why I didn’t tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he’d spare my next effort.

family photo

As Marion Underwood and Robert Faris’ excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.

“Even before the dawn of social media,” they write, “adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist.”

So true. I can’t imagine my 13-year-old self, naïve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today’s unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.

But while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to “go viral”) were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?

Now that I’m a parent of a 10-month-old son, I’m clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents – especially as parents were either bullies or bullied – is what kind of kids do we want to raise?

I could be honest and tell you I’ve had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a “socially-adept” child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn’t the target of bullying. But we’ve had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.

Looking back on my difficult year, I’m not sure I’d wish I could have been popular. I do wish I’d been a little more secure.

I’m also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It’s anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won’t be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.

I think I’m pretty tough. Mine wouldn’t be the best job – regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) – if I had thin skin.

There’s name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there’s stuff you don’t prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.

When we talk about bullying, it’s hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that’s among the adults!).

Of course, we’re tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to “just ignore them” rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.

As difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it’s also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.

Being 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn’t necessarily be that it gets better – adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It’s that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you.

Editor’s Note: Jay Parini, a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont. His newest book is “Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal,” which comes out in October. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

What the American public craves is authenticity: a sense that the men and women we elect are, like us, flesh-and-blood creatures who celebrate and grieve, who dance and despair. But it’s rare to see politician reveal his or her vulnerability before a mass television audience.

Jay Parini

And that is why Vice President Joe Biden’s appearance on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert on Thursday night was so uncommonly moving. In the face of Biden’s offhand honesty, passion and wrenching humanity as he discussed his beloved son Beau’s death from brain cancer earlier this summer, it is almost embarrassing to acknowledge that it made for “good television.”

It was life happening before our eyes, the kind of life we find in our own living rooms and kitchens.

Real conversation about the human experience is something we don’t expect on late night – from arch hosts, and particularly from politicians, who often seem like pieces of Styrofoam.

The Biden appearance slapped the nation awake, reminding us that we’ve become almost numb as we listen to the excuses, the prevarications, the bragging, the naked vanity that seems to dominate both major parties in this election season.

Is it just me, or has it gotten horribly worse Isn’t this why we crave somebody like Joe Biden, somebody willing to reveal his pain, his fear, his frailty and nobility?

It seems unlikely now that Biden will run, not after this interview, where Stephen Colbert — the most gifted interviewer in America today – brought up “the elephant in the room,” which he cleverly suggested was really a donkey. He referred to the pressing political question of the moment: Will Joe Biden challenge Hillary Clinton and others in the ongoing Democratic primary?

A lot hung on his answer, and the whole nation leaned forward to listen.

Biden was shockingly frank for a man under the klieg lights. His face was extremely mobile, with a range of emotion flickering as he dipped his eyes to the floor and seemed to wince. A vast audience saw the obvious truth: Here is father grieving for beloved son, Beau, who died of brain cancer only a few months ago. The rawness of his feelings were vividly on display.

Biden was frank, saying: “I don’t think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, number two, they can look at folks out there and say, ‘I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this.” One could hear a pin drop in the audience, which held its breath. “And I’d be lying if I said that I knew I was there,” Biden added, more or less putting the kibosh on a presidential bid.

He could backtrack, of course, claiming that suddenly a voice had come to him from heaven, saying “Run, Joe, Run!” But that seems highly unlikely now. Voters would genuinely have to wonder if Biden really had the heart, the energy and the passion to give to this difficult and demanding job. Running for high public office can’t be easy. And it’s clear that even Joe doesn’t think he can manage it in the wake of his son’s death.

It’s easy to say why so many like Joe Biden a great deal. I’m among them. He’s a compassionate human being, and he’s real.

Born in 1942, he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania – the lunch-pail capital of the western world, in my view. I grew up only a mile or so from Biden, whose father scraped to find work during some hard economic times in this era, when anthracite mining had died out and left many in northeastern Pennsylvania without other options for making a living. My mother, who died at 97 only last year, was a friend of Biden’s aunt and mother, and she recalled that they moved to Delaware in search of better work.

Like so many baby boomers, Joe was among the first in his family to have a college education, which he managed to get with the aid of scholarships, attending the University of Delaware and law school at Syracuse.

Ordinary Americans identify with Biden. He wasn’t born with a silver spoon in his mouth – like Jeb Bush or Donald Trump. He made his way – slowly but surely – in the often clamorous world of American politics. And he has risen to a height his family could scarcely have imagined in those hardscrabble years after the war in Scranton.

Joe is the real deal. He would have made a great president, perhaps: a man of the people, who understands their needs, their fondest wishes, their fears. But that probably isn’t going to happen.

Nonetheless, Joe Biden has – unexpectedly – wakened a nation to what it craves: a vulnerable but fully committed person who can say what he or she means, without bombast or equivocation, and lead us forward.

Story highlights Mark Zuckerberg announced that his wife had three miscarriages while trying to get pregnant Jodi Abbott, Eugene Declercq: We need to talk about pregnancy loss more; there is no shame in having a miscarriage

Editor’s Note: Jodi F. Abbott is vice chair for education at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Boston University School of Medicine. Eugene Declercq, founder of Birth by the Numbers, is professor and assistant dean at Community Health Sciences Department, Boston University School of Public Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.

(CNN) —

Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are going to have a baby girl.

In his public post that went viral, Zuckerberg wrote: “We want to share one experience to start. We’ve been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way. You feel so hopeful when you learn you’re going to have a child. You start imagining who they’ll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they’re gone. It’s a lonely experience.”

Zuckerberg’s frank admission of his wife’s three miscarriages led to a vast outpouring of stories from women and families who have faced a similar situation.

Millennials have become accustomed to posting their lives online, and yet, as they are coupling and starting families they are discovering that few experiences are as isolating as losing a desired pregnancy.

Eugene Declercq

On top of that, there is a certain stigma associated with miscarriages, as though it’s the fault of the parents. But it isn’t, and the stigma will be removed only if we talk about it more – openly and honestly. There is no shame in having a miscarriage.

A 2013 publication from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were more than 1 million miscarriages (generally referring to pregnancy loss within the first trimester) in 2009. This does not include the more than 23,000 stillbirths (fetal losses after 20 weeks of pregnancy) that occur annually in the United States.

Despite high-profile cases such as Jacqueline Kennedy, who experienced a miscarriage, stillbirth and the loss of a newborn child as well as two healthy children, the loneliness and stigma of miscarriage persists.

Women who cope with losing their pregnancy invariably feel like they are the only ones who have ever suffered this kind of pain. But they are not alone.

While only 1% of women experience more than one pregnancy loss, miscarriages are very common. Some 20% of women who deliver a child have had a prior miscarriage. Miscarriages are also more common as women age. So, as the age of first-time mothers in the United States has increased over the past 25 years, so have miscarriages.

In the past, when American women had more pregnancies they were more likely to already have children. Miscarriages, when they happened, were more common to women who already had successful pregnancies.

Today, with women starting families later and having fewer children, part of the distress that women who lose pregnancies now experience is their emotional conviction that they are broken and won’t be able to ever have a family.

American women also now less often live near their mothers, sisters, aunts and cousins. It’s likely that they haven’t been present and aware when these women lost pregnancies or don’t have physical and emotional support for their losses. As education and jobs take women away from their extended families, the collective and familial knowledge of both successful and unsuccessful pregnancies can be lost.

The good news for couples who have experienced miscarriage is that an isolated miscarriage does not lower the rate of successful pregnancy in the future, and even those with recurrent miscarriages are most likely going to have healthy children.

Suffering a miscarriage doesn’t have to be an isolating experience. There are opportunities to build online communities that can help women share their experiences of loss as well as celebrate their joy of a healthy pregnancy.

The decision of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan to share this very personal experience is a valuable step forward in starting a public discussion about the issue. We need to raise awareness that pregnancy loss is part of millions of women’s reproductive lives. Women don’t have to feel devastated and alone when they experience such a loss.

And when all goes well, we can all appreciate the exquisite miracle of giving birth to a healthy child.

Why are so many people running for president?,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, announced his run in an email to supporters on April 30. He has said the United States needs a ""political revolution"" of working-class Americans to take back control of the government from billionaires. ""This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists,"" Sanders said at a rally in Vermont on May 26.

Hillary Clinton launched her presidential bid on April 12 through a video message on social media. The former first lady, senator and secretary of state is considered the front-runner among possible Democratic candidates. ""Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead. And stay ahead,"" she said in her announcement video. ""Because when families are strong, America is strong. So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey.""

Ohio Gov. John Kasich joined the Republican field July 21 as he formally announced his White House bid. ""I am here to ask you for your prayers, for your support ... because I have decided to run for president of the United States,"" Kasich told his kickoff rally at the Ohio State University.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate, solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOP's establishment. He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23. ""These are all of our stories,"" Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia. ""These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.""

Businessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination. This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White House. ""So, ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again,"" Trump told the crowd at his announcement.

Story highlights Why are so many people running for president? Julian Zelizer says a spot in the national forum can boost a career and a party

(CNN) —

Why are so many people running for president in 2016?

A bunch of candidates who have thrown their hats in the ring – Donald Trump, George Pataki, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley – have little chance of winning, so one is left to wonder: What do they hope to achieve?

If winning isn’t probable, what else can primary candidates intend to accomplish?

There are a number of things that candidates can achieve for themselves or their parties without actually becoming the nominee.

Selling a message: Often candidates want to make sure that their party colleagues are paying attention to certain issues. They feel that the existing leadership and crop of candidates are ignoring key problems that are central to the health of the nation. There are many people in public life who find this to be enough reason to undertake a serious campaign. This was why Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the Democratic primaries in 1968, with the goal of making sure that Democrats who opposed the Vietnam War had a seat at the table.

Julian Zelizer

As a political veteran, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont must realize that the odds of defeating Hillary Clinton are slim. Yet regardless of the outcome, he is bringing to the forefront of the party debate concerns about economic inequality, a broken political process and the rapid deterioration of the environment. Even if Sanders doesn’t gain much traction in terms of actual votes, his ability to push Clinton toward dealing more squarely with these problems would be considered a victory.

Mobilizing new constituencies: Sometimes losing politicians help to mobilize new constituencies into the party. Ronald Reagan did this with right-wing Southern conservatives in the 1976 Republican primaries when he challenged President Gerald Ford. Ford defeated Reagan, though barely, but Reagan brought into the party and energized conservatives who ordinarily had not voted in primaries like Texas.

In 2004, Vermont Gov. Howard Dean used pioneering social media technology to attract younger liberals into the Democratic selection process. Although John Kerry won the nomination, only to lose to George W. Bush in the general election, the groups Dean energized would be central to Barack Obama’s 2008 victory.

Among the Republicans in 2015, Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz – both still long shots for the victory against a Jeb Bush or a Marco Rubio – have the possibility of reaching libertarian and social conservative Republicans who have become disaffected with the GOP over the past decade. Even if they don’t win, they can bring into the party new groups of voters who can help the GOP in this and other elections, as well as their own future candidacies.

Selling themselves: There are some candidates who get into the primaries these days as a vehicle for their own careers. Donald Trump, the real estate mogul and former reality television star, appears to see the selection contest as a way to advance his own fame and reputation. Running for president has been just another way to keep his name alive in the national media.

Others, like Ben Carson, jump into the contest without a clear agenda or connection to broader groups. Their goal seems to be a desire to elevate their own role in the public arena. With such a vibrant world of political media, consulting and think tanks, running for president can enhance a person’s stature and offer opportunities. Mike Huckabee earned himself a spot on Fox News after previous runs.

With Trump, one lure may be that he has name recognition and can likely get into the first GOP debate (on Fox, limited to 10 candidates) and the first tier of the first CNN debate (the network will have a second debate for those who don’t make the first cut). That is priceless national exposure.

Another big outcome of a presidential run could be a vice presidential or Cabinet slot, and this must be on the minds of some of the longer shots. The visibility and stature that can come from running could enhance the appeal of a future appointment of someone like Pataki or Chris Christie.

Testing the waters: For many other candidates, it is clear that winning in American politics can take several tries. Entering the primaries and caucuses is a learning experience. When Mitt Romney ran in 2008, he believed that he had a good chance for the nomination. But even when he lost, the experience helped him be a stronger candidate in 2012, when he won the nomination. Running is also an effort to solidify the credentials needed to approach campaign contributors and super PACs in future years with the hope of being a credible candidate.

There are lower-key candidates, like John Kasich, Scott Walker, and Martin O’Malley, who have high aspirations in the near future but also realize that getting through the competition in 2016 can make them stronger for the next time around.

The primaries and caucuses continue to serve as a powerful national forum through which to achieve a large number of goals. Particularly in an age when there is so much politically centered media, constantly covering the endless campaign and giving attention to any candidate who enters, and when super PACs can single-handedly finance campaigns, the temptations to declare for the presidency are stronger than ever.

Syria crisis: How world should respond (Opinion),"This Roman statue was rescued from Palmyra ahead of ISIS' advance earlier this year. It will be catalogued, boxed up and shipped to a secret and safe location.

In the courtyard of the museum, concrete covers have been constructed around ancient sculptures to protect them from shelling.

A government team evacuated every artifact from the National Museum of Damascus as the war closed in on the capital several years ago.

The battle against ISIS isn't just on the military front. The Syrian government is also fighting to save Syria's history from being destroyed by the terror group.

The U.N. has struggled to get supplies to the few people left in Yarmouk -- and there are fears of an outbreak of typhoid in the camp.

Fighting between rebels and pro-regime forces has flattened most of Yarmouk, a district in the capital that was home to more than a million people before the war began.

One of the locals' favorite spots is Abu Abdou's fruit bar in central Damascus. It's stayed open for business -- but a couple miles down the street, the war is in full effect.

Ali, 5, and his brother Alla, 9, fled with their family to Damascus when their home in Idlib was destroyed by fighting. People in the capital are trying to maintain some sense of normalcy despite the ongoing war.

Story highlights Frida Ghitis says world leaders have failed to manage the crisis in Syria The leaders should consider safe zones for refugees in the country, she says

Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

When you close your eyes and imagine foreign policy under President Trump, you see American diplomats, U.S. allies, and enemies all nervously bracing for the unexpected.

Thousands of refugees are battling European governments. Today, it’s Hungary. Last month, it was Macedonia. Desperate people are paying thousands of dollars to traffickers to take them to safety; scores have died of asphyxia after being locked in trucks that failed to reach their destination; thousands have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.

We are living in the worst refugee crisis since World War II, and yet the truth is that world leaders have failed to manage the crisis. They will, of course, answer to history. But in the meantime, the situation will only become worse without drastic action: More will die, more refugees will arrive unwanted, more countries will become destabilized and, if this goes on much longer, we will have a generation of Syrians who have grown up in the kind of conditions that perpetuate conflict.

It is too late to prevent the current crisis, but there is plenty we can try to do moving forward to try to ease it.

What exactly?

For a start, world leaders should convene a top-level emergency gathering to focus on the key aspects of this crisis. The conference should be called by a group of countries, including Germany with strong backing from the United States, and should include the European Union, the United Nations and other world powers, Syria’s neighbors, and also Russia and China. The objective should be threefold: to stop the killing, to help the refugees and to bring an end to the war.

Arab nations must play a major role in addressing the Syrian crisis. We are all responsible. But the people of Syria are their neighbors, their brethren. The conflict is in their midst, its impact close to home. To be sure, the neighborhood has not completely failed Syrian refugees. The overwhelming majority of those who have fled Syria – millions of them – are now living in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and Arab states have helped finance those costs. But more is needed.

Once convened, this international conference should work to develop a comprehensive international plan to help refugees, one that involves a much greater role for Arab and other Muslim states. Indeed, wealthy Gulf states should be encouraged to not just make an outsize financial contribution, but countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia should be pressed to welcome refugees.

Of course, Europe and the United States should also receive more from among the millions of desperate Syrian refugees fleeing conflict. But so should thriving Muslim states such as Malaysia, Indonesia and of course Iran, whose support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad means it has additional moral responsibility for what is happening. (And speaking of Asia, this could be an opportunity for a country like Japan, with its demographic crisis, to boost its population, or at least do its part to share the burden of this major humanitarian emergency.)

But giving refuge to those who are fleeing the horrors of conflict is not enough – the crisis also needs to be tackled at its source. So, to at least try to slow the killing, it is time to give serious consideration to the establishment of safe zones inside Syria, a proposal that is actually more complicated than it might sound.

For example, when Turkey proposed such an approach, some feared that it secretly planned to expel Syrian refugees from Turkish territory and send them back inside Syria to any safe zones. If the system is to work, these zones must come with an ironclad vow from countries hosting refugees not to force anyone to return to Syria before the war is over.

Safe zones will, of course, require a military commitment to be effective, perhaps from the United States, NATO and other allies, to guarantee the “safe” in “safe zones.” They will therefore need to become no-fly zones, with air patrols and anti-aircraft support on the ground. The betrayal of so-called safe areas in Bosnia’s Srebrenica must never be allowed to happen again.

Above all, though, it is imperative to bring an end to the war, to defeat ISIS and – just as crucially, although this point now often gets overlooked – to bring an end to the regime of al-Assad, whose rejection of peaceful demands for democratic reform laid the groundwork for this epic human displacement and for the upsurge in extremism.

And epic this displacement has truly been – more than 320,000 people have been killed in the war, according to one monitoring group, and there is no end in sight. Before the war started in 2011, about 23 million people lived in Syria. Fully half of them have been displaced. Some 7.5 million are internally displaced. More than 4 million are registered with the United Nations, and many of those fleeing have not been. It is estimated that there are almost 2 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, at least 600,000 in Jordan and perhaps 1.1 million in Lebanon, where they now make up nearly a quarter of the total population.

Such an enormous movement of people is further destabilizing an already unsettled region, and bringing with it a level of disruption that could very well sow the seeds for another generation of conflict and extremism.

The West’s initial approach, which effectively viewed the Syrian civil war as “their problem,” has merely underscored how in reality there is no way to contain such conflicts within national boundaries – this war has spawned ISIS, its videotaped beheadings and sanctioned sexual slavery, scattering its poisonous extremist ideology far and wide. And while an international gathering cannot undo the devastation that has been wrought, it can still be a positive first step toward winding down this conflict.

This is the moral and strategic challenge of our time. So far, the world has failed. But if its leaders can begin to publicly and materially empower those who stand for a pluralistic, tolerant and democratic Syria – one that will eventually welcome back the millions of citizens who have fled – then we might be able to turn the compassion we have seen in recent days into a more hopeful legacy for the country and its people.

Story highlights A Japanese maglev train has reached a speed of almost 400 mph Michael Smart: Big barrier to improved U.S. rail service is lack of political will

Editor’s Note: Michael Smart is an assistant professor of transportation planning at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The views expressed are his own.

(CNN) —

Imagine being able to travel from New York to Los Angeles without having to step on a plane, yet be able to do so in a fraction of the time it would take to drive. On the surface, that tantalizing prospect took a step closer with the news last month that a Japanese maglev train had reached a top speed of close to 400 mph, breaking its own world record in the process.

And the sight of futuristic looking trains whizzing past platforms at hundreds of miles per hour isn’t confined to Japan: China, France and Spain, to name a few, have their own high-speed rail networks. Indeed, while these bullet trains may look futuristic, they have been around for decades; they’re a tried and tested technology that the Japanese debuted over 50 years ago.

So surely it’s only a matter of time before large numbers of U.S. passengers are doing a daily commute to New York from Washington and Boston in about the time it would take them to drive to work in their own cities, right?

Not anytime soon.

While several countries have undertaken the tough work of raising the money to invest in bullet trains, it’s unlikely the United States will ever see the vast network of high-speed trains that blanket other countries. Indeed, passenger rail service in the United States lags behind much of the rest of the developed world, for several reasons.

For a start, much of the United States is not exactly an ideal market for high-speed rail. Compared to places where rail really flourishes – Japan and Western Europe, for instance – the United States is geographically vast. As a result, in much of the country, cities are far enough apart that air travel provides significant time savings, even compared to some of the fastest trains.

The layout of cities matters, too. When you arrive in Tokyo, Paris or Barcelona, it’s often convenient (and even pleasant) to walk to your final destination. When it’s not, a fast and frequent mass transportation system awaits to whisk you away. This is not the case in many American cities, where arriving by train typically means jumping into a cab or renting a car for the last leg of your journey. Simply put, in many sprawling U.S. cities, getting to your destination by train can still mean you’ve got quite a way yet to get home. We could change that. And we probably should. But we’re not there yet.

Still, there are several parts of the United States where high-speed rail makes a great deal of sense.

The Northeast Corridor (Boston-New York-Washington) comes in at the top of just about every list of potential candidates for high-speed rail, with the distances involved being considered within the “Goldilocks” zone for fast trains. For example, at just over 200 miles from New York to both Boston and Washington, fast trains could compete with even faster airplanes by offering centrally located stations and providing an alternative to the hassle of airport security lines. These cities are dense, have strong downtowns, and extensive mass transit systems once you arrive.

Just as importantly, rail on the Northeast Corridor can also compete with driving, mainly because traffic congestion makes driving in the region so slow and unreliable, while tolls and parking costs can make it an expensive and time-consuming option. Rail in the northeast even has a great track record; after Amtrak’s almost-high-speed Acela service began on the Northeast Corridor in 2000, ridership exploded, quickly outstripping air travel between New York and Washington.

However, the biggest barrier to improved rail service in the United States is simply the lack of political will. At the federal level, support for passenger rail service has languished and Washington has devolved decision-making (and increasingly, funding) to the states. With the nation’s transportation trust fund nearly broke and no permanent solution in sight, it seems unlikely the federal government will champion high-speed rail – a costly endeavor – in the near future.

Without leadership from the federal government, the states are largely in control. Yet many of the most promising corridors for high-speed rail cross state lines, making it difficult to plan for better rail service. In 2009, the Obama administration awarded nearly a billion dollars of stimulus money to plan and upgrade a high-speed rail line connecting Chicago to Milwaukee and Madison. A year later, Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, rejected his state’s portion of the money and the project was, for the time being, at least, derailed. (The money quickly found its way to a grateful California for its high-speed rail line.)

Still, all is not lost for those hoping to see high-speed rail in the United States.

California is committed to building its high-speed rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles, paying for the line largely with state money raised by a new cap-and-trade market on carbon emissions. Several privately funded projects are also in the planning stages. For instance, a Dallas-to-Houston line promises 205 mph service in 2021 without a single dollar from the taxpayer. Meanwhile, another private company has already begun construction on a Miami-to-Orlando line with a more modest speed of 125 mph, with service expected to begin in 2017.

All this points to how high-speed rail will likely progress in the United States: piecemeal. It is doubtful that we will have a nationwide system of fast trains soon. And this is not necessarily a bad thing; through a combination of private and public action, we should target markets where high-speed rail makes sense. That means looking for shorter corridors connecting dense places with existing mass transit infrastructure.

High-speed rail won’t be cheap, so we’ll have to choose wisely. Some of the most promising corridors are also the most expensive; Amtrak estimates upgrading the Northeast Corridor to true high-speed rail would cost upward of $150 billion. Such an undertaking requires careful consideration of the economic, environmental and other costs and benefits of individual projects. But more importantly, it requires the kind of long-term planning that seems to have become vanishingly rare.

Thankfully, high-speed rail doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing approach. And while given the choice I would rather be riding Japan’s speeding bullet trains, even the incremental improvements we’ve seen in services like Amtrak’s Acela can make rail travel a lot more appealing for the hundreds of thousands of passengers who rely on it every year.

The marriage apocalypse may be coming (Opinion),"Story highlights Carol Costello: Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free In countries like Sweden or Denmark, people don't feel pressured to marry even if they have kids together

Editor’s Note: Carol Costello anchors the 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET edition of CNN’s “Newsroom” each weekday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single.

I did. And I do.

Recently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. ‘Cause, guess what? They don’t care what your generation thinks – they’ll get married if and when they want.

“I didn’t go to college for four years to be a mom,” 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. “There’s no housewife degree. I’ve worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well.”

Jackie Demate, also 21, agreed. “I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe.”

Carol Costello

At first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, “Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!”

Jackie didn’t blink. “But, Europe!” she exclaimed. “I’m really looking for a travel buddy. And I don’t think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I’m not happy. … I’m OK being single forever. As long as I’m happy.”

Before you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she’s coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once. That’s up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960.

What a fine example my generation is! Not.

Still, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29.

Religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction.

A study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says: “From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being.” On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be “more desirable marriage prospects.”

Bingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don’t want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt.

“Right now, I’m 21 years old. And I’m thousands of dollars in debt,” Emily Crille told me. “That wasn’t something my parents bore. And it’s really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don’t have a job, and you don’t have a home.”

I felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either – until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable?

Perhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it’s exactly right.

Scandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today: “In Norway … 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it’s clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying.”

The article also points out that “Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations’ quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation’s well-being. The USA came in eighth.”

In an effort to understand the joys of “sambo,” the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden.

“To put it short,” he told us, “marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation.”

Wow.

Fifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, “I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don’t think the whole thing is worth it.”

Maybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: “The notion that marriage is something that you’re pressured into seems horrible to me. … Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities.”

My Kent State millennials – true romantics – would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, “Marriage is about love. It’s not about planning or timing, and that’s what we’re all kind of waiting for.”

Marriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn’t enough.

Which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn’t plan to have children, what was the point?

In the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with “I dos”?

I don’t know. But I would love to know if you do.

Vonnegut died at age 84 in 2007.

Greg Epstein is the humanist chaplain at Harvard University and the author of the New York Times bestseller ""Good Without God."" In the introduction, he wrote, ""This is not a book about whether one can be good without God, because that question does not need to be answered -- it needs to be rejected outright. To suggest that one can't be good without belief in God is not just an opinion, a mere curious musing -- it is a prejudice.""

In his book ""The Grand Design,"" theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking asserts that God did not create the universe. ""Spontaneous creation is the reason why there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist,"" he wrote. ""It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.""

British physicist Peter Higgs is among those credited with the theory behind the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle long thought to be a fundamental building block of the universe.

Neuroscientist and author Sam Harris is a well-known atheist and a vocal critic of religion. In ""The End of Faith,"" he wrote, ""We will see that the greatest problem confronting civilization is not merely religious extremism: rather, it is the larger set of cultural and intellectual accommodations we have made to faith itself.""

Christopher Hitchens, a British author and antitheist who died in 2011 at age 62, viewed religion as ""the main source of hatred in the world."" In his book ""God is Not Great,"" Hitchens wrote, ""There are days when I miss my old convictions as if they were an amputated limb. But in general I feel better, and no less radical, and you will feel better too, I guarantee, once you leave hold of the doctrinaire and allow your chainless mind to do its own thinking.""

British evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist Richard Dawkins' views about religion were summed up in his bestselling book ""The God Delusion."" He wrote, ""We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further."" His coming-out campaign suggests atheists should be proud rather than apologetic.

Comedian Kathy Griffin, a self-described ""militant atheist,"" made her position clear with a controversial Emmy Award acceptance speech in 2007. ""A lot of people come up here and they thank Jesus for this award,"" she said. ""I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus. He didn't help me a bit. ... So all I can say is, suck it, Jesus. This award is my god now.""

Ricky Gervais, creator of the British series ""The Office,"" wrote about his religious journey in an essay published in 2010 by the Wall Street Journal. ""Wow. No God. If mum had lied to me about God, had she also lied to me about Santa? Yes, of course, but who cares? The gifts kept coming,"" he said. ""And so did the gifts of my new found atheism. The gifts of truth, science, nature. The real beauty of this world.""

Seth MacFarlane, creator of the animated series ""Family Guy,"" has become vocal about his atheism. Asked about it in a 2009 interview with Esquire, he said, ""It's like the civil-rights movement. There have to be people who are vocal about the advancement of knowledge over faith.""

Actress Jodie Foster told Entertainment Weekly in 2007 that she was an atheist. She added, ""But I absolutely love religions and the rituals. Even though I don't believe in God, we celebrate pretty much every religion in our family with the kids.""

British actor Hugh Laurie, known for his lead role on the medical drama ""House,"" confirmed his atheism in a 2007 interview with The Sunday Telegraph. ""I don't believe in God,"" he said, ""but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that if he saw you taking anything for granted, he'd take it away.""

Academy Award-winning director James Cameron, known for films such as ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar,"" calls himself a ""converted agnostic.""

Atheists believe there is no God, while agnostics say it's impossible to prove or disprove God's existence.

Penn Jillette, half of the Emmy Award-winning magic duo Penn & Teller, wrote the book ""God, No! Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales."" In it, he said, ""If every trace of any single religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created exactly that way again. There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense. If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true, and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.""

Composer and musician Brian Eno refers to himself as an ""evangelical atheist."" In 2007, he told the BBC, ""What religion says to you, essentially, is that you're not in control. Now that's a very liberating idea. It's quite a frightening idea as well, in some ways.""

Singer-songwriter Billy Joel reiterated his stance in a 2010 interview with radio host Howard Stern. Asked whether he believed in God, Joel replied, ""No. I'm an atheist."" His song ""Only the Good Die Young"" includes the line ""I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.""

British actress Emma Thompson said in a 2008 interview, ""I'm an atheist; I suppose you can call me a sort of libertarian anarchist. I regard religion with fear and suspicion. It's not enough to say that I don't believe in God. I actually regard the system as distressing: I am offended by some of the things said in the Bible and the Quran, and I refute them.""

Legendary CBS News commentator Andy Rooney, who died in 2011 at age 92, was outspoken about religion. ""I am an atheist,"" Rooney said at Tufts University in 2004. ""I don't understand religion at all. I'm sure I'll offend a lot of people by saying this, but I think it's all nonsense.""

Sir Ian McKellen, best known for his roles as Gandalf in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and Magneto in the ""X-Men"" films, has listed atheism among the causes he cares most about. But he says since coming out as gay in 1988, he has been reluctant to lobby on issues beyond his most urgent concern: ""legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.""

English actress Keira Knightley has joked that she wishes she were Catholic. ""If only I wasn't an atheist; I could get away with anything,"" she said in 2012. ""You'd just ask for forgiveness, and then you'd be forgiven.""

A GQ cover story in 2012 noted that Spanish actor Javier Bardem is an atheist. He is quoted as saying, ""I've always said I don't believe in God; I believe in Al Pacino.""

During a 2002 interview on ""Inside the Actor's Studio,"" actress Julianne Moore was asked what she would like to hear God say to her at the gates of heaven. She replied, ""Well, I guess you were wrong. I do exist.""

British actor Daniel Radcliffe, known for his role as Harry Potter, declared he was an atheist in a 2009 interview. ""I'm an atheist, but I'm very relaxed about it,"" he said. ""I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do.""

British entrepreneur and Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson said in a 2011 interview with CNN's Piers Morgan that he believes in evolution and the importance of humanitarian efforts but not in the existence of God. ""I would love to believe,"" he said. ""It's very comforting to believe.""

Houston Texans running back Arian Foster opened up about his beliefs and publicly stated that he doesn't believe in God in an interview with ESPN published August 6. ""Everybody always says the same thing: You have to have faith,"" he said. ""That's my whole thing: Faith isn't enough for me. For people who are struggling with that, they're nervous about telling their families or afraid of the backlash. ... Man, don't be afraid to be you. I was, for years.""

Story highlights Ryan Bell, former pastor turned atheist, says we don't need a divinity to find meaning Bell: The absence of God has made him appreciate life and its potential even more

Editor’s Note: Ryan Bell is a writer and speaker on the topic of religion and irreligion in America. In January 2014, Ryan began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the United States. He blogs about his experience on www.YearWithoutGod.com.

(CNN) —

It was January 2014 and I was sitting on the beach in Malibu looking out at the seemingly endless Pacific Ocean, ebbing and flowing. I had just begun a personal project of challenging my lifelong assumption that God exists.

You see, I had been a Seventh-day Adventist pastor for 19 years. I resigned from my pastoral position the year before, but now I stepped away from my faith altogether. It was a gut-wrenching decision but I couldn’t see any other way to find peace and clarity. I encountered major theological differences with my denomination and evangelical Christianity in general, including the way it marginalizes women and LGBT people.

Ryan Bell

I questioned the problem of evils and God’s general silence and inactivity. I sought out more liberal theologies and found them to be the slow death of God. Now I had to face the very real possibility that God does not exist.

Would I discover that God was present and involved, or would I discover that the whole web of theological claims I had embraced and helped develop were false?

I was feeling small against the beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent sea before me. Then I started to feel grateful. “What are the chances that I would be sitting on this beach right now, looking at this remarkable scene of beauty?” I thought. I was struck again by how unlikely my existence is.

One question I’ve been repeatedly asked is how my life has any meaning without God. While I had heard dozens of Christian apologists claim that meaning cannot be found without God, I had a curious experience. My appreciation for life and its potential increased when I stepped away from my faith.

Atheists are often accused of being nihilists or absurdists. Absurdism is a school of thought arguing that humanity’s effort to find inherent meaning in life is futile. Nihilism goes further and in doing so becomes a mood or a disposition as well as a philosophical frame of mind. Nihilism says that nothing matters at all.

“If there is no God, then man and the universe are doomed. Like prisoners condemned to death, we await our unavoidable execution. There is no God, and there is no immortality. And what is the consequence of this? It means that life itself is absurd. It means that the life we have is without ultimate significance, value, or purpose,” writes William Lane Craig, a Christian apologist.

But my experience is that acknowledging the absence of God has helped me refocus on the wonderful and unlikely life I do have. This realization has increased my appreciation for beauty and given me a sense of immediacy about my life. As I come to terms with the fact that this life is the only one I get, I am more motivated than ever to make it count.

I want to experience as much happiness and pleasure as I can while helping others to attain their happiness. I construct meaning in my life from many sources, including love, family, friendships, service, learning and so on.

Popular Christian theology, on the other hand, renders this life less meaningful by anchoring all notions of value and purpose to a paradise somewhere in the future, in a place other than where we are right now. Ironically, my Christian upbringing taught me that ultimately this life doesn’t matter, which tends to make believers apathetic about suffering and think that things will only get worse before God suddenly solves everything on the last day.

Behold, atheists’ new Ten Commandments

It struck me this year that nihilism is a disease born of theism. Some people have been taught to expect meaning outside of this world beyond our earthly experiences. When they come upon the many absurdities of life and see that it’s “not as advertised,” an existential despair can take hold.

The problem is not solved by inventing a God in which to place all our hopes, but rather, to face life honestly and create beauty from the absurd.

Without dependency on a cosmic savior who is coming to rescue us, we are free to recognize that we are the ones we’re waiting for. If we don’t make the world a fair and habitable place, no one else is going to do it for us. Our lives matter because our choices affect others and our children’s future.

Life does not need a divine source in order to be meaningful. Anyone who has seen a breathtaking sunset or fallen in love with another human being knows that we make meaning from the experiences of our lives; we construct it the way we construct any social narrative.

Free from false expectations we are free to create purpose, share love, and enjoy the endless beauty of our world. We are the fortunate ones. There is no need for fear to have the last word.

Nudity doesn’t shock us anymore,"Helen Mirren has appeared in several films topless or nude, including 2003's ""Calendar Girls,"" but she told Alan Cumming for the CBS show ""Remember That Time?"" that those days are behind her.

Even those who've never watched a single episode of Lena Dunham's ""Girls"" know that the show includes plenty of nudity -- and most often, it's Dunham herself showing skin. While Dunham's said that her frequent nakedness isn't a political statement and is more about creative expression, she does acknowledge that it can have cultural impact. ""We have this insane culture where women who don't look like the cast of 'Gossip Girl' are put into like sweaters and nightgowns to sleep in,"" she told CBS News in 2013. ""What I love are the films of the '70s where a person gets out of bed and you see half their nipple because that's what it looks like when a person gets out of bed.""

Daniel Radcliffe spent so much time naked on the sets of films and productions, he had to ask the producers of his Brit drama ""A Young Doctor's Notebook"" to let him keep some clothes on. ""I think there was a discussion about possible nudity for one scene,"" Radcliffe recalled to The Independent, ""and I think my comment was, 'I got naked in three films last year; please can I not?' ""

Kate Winslet has famously had her nude portrait drawn in the film ""Titanic"" and stripped for other roles, though she admits it can get a bit weird stripping down on set. ""I just go in and say 'Oh, f**k, let's do it.' and boom,"" she said in an interview. ""If you complain about it or procrastinate, it's not going to go away. It's a profoundly bizarre thing to do. As actors, you talk about it all the time.""

Lindsay Lohan was featured on the cover of the January/February 2012 issue of Playboy magazine, and her nude scenes from the 2013 film ""The Canyons"" have shown up online.

Jennifer Aniston explored the world of free love and nudity with Paul Rudd in the film ""Wanderlust."" She has been quoted as saying being nude in movies is ""liberating"" but denied to friend Chelsea Handler on her late night talk show that she and her now-husband, Justin Theroux, are nudists.

Lady Gaga will pretty much get nude anywhere, it seems: magazine spreads, music videos, whatever. Of course, she'll also wear meat.

It's just too easy to make the joke about Shia LaBeouf's loving to be in ""la buff."" He tweeted a nude photo of himself from the 2013 film ""Charlie Countryman"" and has not been shy about appearing naked in movies and a music video.

What better way to get in touch with nature than to leave behind your clothes? That's what ""True Blood"" star Alexander Skarsgard did on a trip to the South Pole, as captured by adventure guide Inge Solheim. The snapshot isn't too surprising -- even considering the frigid temperature -- since this is one actor who has zero problems with nudity. On the job, ""if we're naked in the scene, then I'm naked,"" Skarsgard once explained to Rolling Stone.

Justin Bieber is a documented fan of public shirtlessness and singing songs to his grandmother in the nude. We can now also call the ""Baby"" singer a fan of the public striptease. At the 2014 charity event Fashion Rocks, Bieber removed everything but his underwear while on stage with co-presenter Lara Stone, explaining that he just didn't feel comfortable unless he was in his ""Calvins.""

Is it any shock that Rihanna showed up in a see-through dress to receive a Fashion Icon award at the 2014 CFDA fashion awards? After all, she has a perfume called Nude. (You can search around for the more explicit pics, as we are a family-friendly site.)

Some of you might be more familiar with Kim Kardashian's curves than your own physique. Kardashian appeared nude in a recent photo shoot for Paper magazine. The reality star became famous with a sex tape and stayed famous with her reality show and photos such as this one, which she did for W magazine in 2010. Though Kardashian later said she didn't think she'd ever pose nude again, she still frequently posts the next best thing on her Instagram account.

James Franco and Seth Rogen had to survive in the wild in the altogether in an episode of Discovery's ""Naked and Afraid"" series. Franco expressed his love for being nude while Rogen asked, ""Can you make the blur big? Like a giant blur?""

Believe it or not, Matthew McConaughey passed up an opportunity to shed some of his clothes. The actor didn't reprise his role of male stripper Dallas in ""Magic Mike XXL."" This doesn't mean McConaughey's changed his ways; he told GQ magazine in December 2013 that yes, he does still like to play the bongo drums naked.

Channing Tatum shows off some of his better assets in the movie ""Magic Mike"" and its sequel. But as he told Elle magazine, he enjoys being in the buff off-camera, too. ""I have a really nice back porch where the pool is,"" he said. ""Once the shoes are off, the socks come off too, and then everything else downstairs just follows at some point.""

Story highlights Peggy Drexler: Male models at Rick Owens' Paris runway show wore clothes that exposed their penises She says as we become harder to shock, the culture keeps going lower and lower. The bottom is in sight

Editor’s Note: Peggy Drexler is the author of “Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family” and “Raising Boys Without Men.” She is an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and a former gender scholar at Stanford University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.

(CNN) —

In Paris on Thursday, fashion designer Rick Owens gave audiences quite a show when he sent male models down the runway wearing clothes with peepholes that offered a glimpse of the guys’ formerly private parts.

“Nudity is the most simple and primal gesture – it packs a punch,” Owens said of his decision to have his models bare all. “It’s powerful. … Who else can really get away with this stuff? It’s a corporate world!”

The looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate – after all, they can’t be worn out in public and won’t be sold in stores. But let’s be honest: Were we even shocked? After all, female models have been asked to sashay down runways in states of near nakedness for years.

Meanwhile, more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity. There was Michael Fassbender in “Shame,” of course. And who can forget the uproar over the cameo of Ben Affleck’s penis in “Gone Girl,” albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it? And if we’ve seen Ben Affleck’s penis, who cares about some male model’s?

Of course, women have been going full frontal in films for years.

Perhaps the onslaught of nakedness is a sign that public nudity is becoming an equal opportunity endeavor; that women are no longer required to do all the showing. That’s not a bad thing. Maybe the “Free the Nipple” people are finally getting their way, and women will be able to parade topless around town, or at the gym, or wherever they please, without stares or stigma (or arrest), as men have done for ages.

More likely, it’s a clear sign that we’re a culture so overexposed that we’ve got no other choice but to up the stakes at every turn. We are becoming – have become – immune to that which was previously surprising/revolting/ awe-inspiring. It’s amazing how quickly Lady Gaga went from outre to passe, isn’t it? Meanwhile, Madonna is a faint middle-aged voice from the past who in a time long ago made news with pointy bras – positively puritanical compared to the starlets of today.

Consider their norms: Going commando – that’s “without underwear,” because, yes, there’s even a phrase for it. Giving birth on TV. Posing naked for mainstream magazines. The Kardashian sisters spent the fall one-upping each other – first Kim’s naked backside on the cover of Paper (a sight credited with “breaking the Internet”) and then Kourtney’s naked pregnant belly (and backside) online at DuJour, because if one reality sister does it, so, too, must the other.

Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, continues to one-up herself, graduating from foam fingers and lewd gestures to her recent full frontal magazine spread in V magazine, the release of which she celebrated with a crude shoutout on social media.

But what’s next? What does she, or any of these women, do for an encore? Where does a jaded culture go from here for kicks? The envelope has already been pushed beyond what we once thought were the limits. What is left?

Perhaps they’ll think of something. You just know those “Most Shocking” shows are trying to figure out how to show somebody actually die. You know that some starlet on the verge will go beyond a private sex tape (yawn) to arrange to be caught in the act.

Or maybe we’ll grow up and become more European in our sensibilities, and react less like middle school boys at the sight of a breast. Maybe we’ll learn that hitting bottom culturally reveals a whole new bottom underneath. Whatever the impetus, the bottom is in sight. After all, being outrageous today is hard work, and only getting harder. The payoff, meanwhile, has nowhere to go but down.

Single women: Why they're on the rise (Opinion),"Story highlights Pepper Schwartz: The rise of the voluntarily single woman is a slow, gradual revolution Schwartz: 53% of women over 18 are single; is this natural, bad, or alarming? She says since few people have it all, why not stay single if that's the best option? Schwartz: People get married when it's a good deal, so why isn't it a good deal anymore?

Editor’s Note: Pepper Schwartz is professor of sociology at the University of Washington and the author of many books, the latest of which is “The Normal Bar.” She is the love and relationship ambassador for AARP and writes the Naked Truth column for AARP.org. She is also a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit organization that gathers research on American families. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

Women are marrying at a later age these days, cohabiting with their partners or going in and out of short-term relationships without ever walking down the aisle.

Currently, 53% of women over 18 are in the singles column. Put another way, women now have choices that allow them to customize the arc of their lives and some of them find that it is best for them to put marriage aside.

Is this natural? Is this bad? Is this cause for alarm?

We have long counted on women’s sacrifices and the compromises they’ve made to lift societies all over the world. We are worried that if women delay or forgo marriage, the all-important family unit will suffer.

As much as I admire happy couples and families, I think this may be one of the few times in history when so many women could choose from such a full range of life choices without penalty or stigma. Since few people “have it all,” why not choose being single if that’s the best option?

What it comes down to is people get married when it’s a good deal. The question is why isn’t marriage a good deal anymore? Here are some considerations.

1. A useless husband

If a woman is poor and only meets equally poor or poorer men, she’s in a tough spot. It is no secret that many women do not choose to marry if the available partners will make their economic situation worse.

In some of these cases, even if a woman has a child, she may be better off with government help than a nonworking, noninvolved husband.

2. Success changes everything

When a woman is very privileged or highly successful, marriage could come very easily – or not. Think of the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times. Or Oprah Winfrey, who for personal or professional reasons, is not married.

Moreover, a woman doesn’t need a husband who is a high-powered corporate attorney if she is a high-powered corporate attorney. Taking advantage of economic and professional opportunities could be undermined by committing to a partner with an equally ambitious, or different, life agenda. This kind of woman may wake up every day to new and exciting challenges and think, “best to wait.”

3. Unwilling to make traditional compromises

A woman who doesn’t want to settle for cooking and cleaning and being the primary parent that society prefers. She is not meeting guys who want the kind of woman she is.

4. The marriage penalty tax

Some women are in an income bracket where marriage inflicts economic costs. She would have to pay more taxes if she marries someone who earns approximately what she makes or more.

5. Avoiding cheating men

A few years ago when I was in China, I had a conversation with some very beautiful female Chinese TV personalities about their personal life. I asked them why they were single and if they wanted to get married.

The three women all said they didn’t want to marry because “the men of our class will all expect to have mistresses, and it is better not to marry than have to put up with that.” I have no idea if this was an exaggeration or not – but they believed it.

6. Waiting for the “one”

These women wait for the perfect guy, or the guy who they would fall in love with and love them back just as much. If that man doesn’t come along, they prefer to go alone. As women get pickier, more factors enter into the marriage equation.

They may find someone who doesn’t quite go the distance even after years of dating. They cohabit with someone and it doesn’t work out. Singlehood, never intentional, becomes a fact. But they will not marry just to marry as their mothers or grandmothers might have.

In social psychology, there is a classic theory called “exchange theory.” It is a bit cold-blooded, but it predicts that a person’s actions will be based on trying to find a balance of give and get. Each person’s resources – of all kinds, including money, looks, background – are traded back and forth for a “good deal.” For example, a “good deal” scenario could be a woman who makes an excellent living pairing up with a man who is a writer and is willing to work at home and be the primary child care person.

When women’s life choices were highly constrained, they had little negotiating power. They had to marry or were seen as damaged. A few got away with being “free spirits” but usually they were exceptional in wealth or lineage – and even so, it wasn’t easy.

It’s different now. While most women still want marriage, they don’t want it at just any price. They don’t want it if it scuttles their dreams. Marriage is not dead – not by a long shot. It is still, to most of us, the house we wish to build for our love, our lover and our children.

But women want to craft a life instead of having it pressed upon them. And that means some of us will be single for a long time, and some of us will be single for life.

The world's deepest shipwreck has been fully surveyed,"(CNN) — The world's deepest known shipwreck, a World War II US Navy destroyer, has been fully mapped and filmed by a US-based crew.

The ship, the USS Johnston, is at a depth of 21,180 feet (about 6,500 meters) in the Philippine Sea. Its location has been known, but this is the first time that a crew has been able to map and film the entire wreck site.

Caladan Oceanic, a US-based private company that focuses on ocean expeditions, gets credit for reaching the shipwreck on March 31. Its research vessel, the DSV Limiting Factor, was able to survey the wreck, which was more than 100 feet deeper than previously believed, sitting in the darkness more than four miles below the surface of the Pacific.

Caladan Oceanic's founder is Victor Vescovo, a former US Navy commander who has a long-established passion for visiting some of the world's most hard-to-get-to places. He holds the record for being the first person in history to have been to the top of all the world's continents, both poles, and the bottom of all its oceans.

With the survey of the USS Johnston, Vescovo reached another milestone -- completing the deepest shipwreck dive in history. He was at the controls of the Limiting Factor for the whole process, which took place in two eight-hour segments over two days.

Sunk during the Battle off Samar

The USS Johnston was sunk by the Japanese navy on October 25,1944, during the Battle off Samar. It was one of four naval battles which comprised the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest battles in the history of naval warfare and engagement that sounded the death knell of the Japanese navy in World War II, according to the US Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC).

Sam Cox, director of the NHHC, said the new images of the wreck of the Johnston help the Navy put the spotlight on the heroism and history of its crew.

The ship was named after Lieutenant John V. Johnston, a Civil War hero. Vulcan Inc.

The Johnston was captained by Cmdr. Ernest Evans, a Native American from Oklahoma. Along with two other US destroyers and four smaller destroyer escorts, Evans led the Johnston in attacking a far superior Japanese force of four battleships, six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and 11 destroyers, according to the NHHC account of the battle.

In an initial encounter, fire from the Johnston knocked out a Japanese cruiser, but the US destroyer was heavily damaged and its ammunition depleted. Evans himself was seriously wounded.

Undaunted, Evans regrouped his crew and the Johnston attacked the Japanese ships again, drawing their fire from a nearby US aircraft carrier.

After two-and-a-half hours of fighting, the Johnston was without power and surrounded by Japanese ships. Evans ordered the crew to abandon ship, and it rolled over and sank.

Researchers believe they found the wreckage of the USS Johnston World War II era destroyer at a depth of 20,400 feet under the Philippine Sea. Vulcan Inc.

Two of the three ships that followed the Johnston into the Japanese battle line were also sunk, said Carl Schuster, a former Navy captain and Hawaii Pacific University instructor.

""The discovery of the USS Johnston serves as yet another reminder of the heroism and sacrifice of that day in Leyte Gulf 77 years ago,"" he said.

Of the Johnston's crew of 327 men,186 died, including Evans. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the first Native American in the US Navy to be awarded his country's highest military honor, according to the NHHC.

For Vescovo, being able to reach the USS Johnston was a very personal mission.",
Japanese man invents 'edible' plastic bag alternative to save Nara's sacred deer,"(CNN) — A local entrepreneur in the Japanese tourist destination of Nara has developed an alternative to plastic shopping bags, to protect the town's sacred deer

Hidetoshi Matsukawa, who works for Nara-ism, a souvenir wholesale agent, told CNN he heard last year that the deer, which roam the city's park, were dying after ingesting plastic bags.

""I wanted to do something to protect the deer, which is the symbol of Nara,"" he said.

The city is home to around 1,000 sacred deer, which are officially designated as a national natural treasure in Japan , and many tourists feed them treats.

In July 2019, however, a local welfare group said nine deer had been found dead, with plastic bags in their stomachs, and called on visitors not to throw away plastic bags in the park.

Matsukawa wanted to come up with a different solution to the problem, and teamed up with a local paper manufacturer and a design firm to work on the project.

Between them they developed ""Shikagami,"" or deer paper, which is made from rice bran and milk cartons.

""We learned rice bran are mostly wasted in the process of rice polishing,"" said Matsukawa. ""So this paper helps to reduce that waste as well.""

Matsukawa has had the bags tested and says they are safe for human consumption.

""We do not have the data to back up that this paper is not harmful to deers, but I believe this is safe for them as well as for human beings,"" he said, laughing.

The bags have since been tested at local banks and the Todaiji temple, Nara's main tourist attraction. The temple and banks bought 4,000-5,000 of the bags for 100 yen (around 95 cents) each as part of the pilot project.

The price will fall if more businesses sign up to use the bags, said Matsukawa, who dreams of replacing plastic bags across the city to prevent more deer from dying after eating them.

""The news about the death of deer by plastic bags creates a negative image, as though the park is a cemetery for deer,"" he said. ""The paper bags can protect deer, as well as the brand image of Nara with deer.""",
"Sri Lanka's leopards are under threat, but this woman is determined to save them","(CNN) Having endured a bloody civil war from 1983 until 2009, Sri Lanka is now at peace and developing rapidly. That's good news for the country as a whole, but the island nation's leopards are under threat.

Sri Lankan conservationist Anjali Watson says that as forests where leopards live are cleared to plant crops and build homes, the big cats are being squeezed into pockets of wilderness that don't connect with each other.

""We've lost a lot of leopards,"" says Watson. Nobody knows how many prowled the land before the war, but about 70% of the animals' habitat has been destroyed, and only 750 to 1,000 adult leopards remain, she says.

What's more, leopards are at risk of getting caught in snares. The wire traps are usually set for bushmeat species, including wild boar and deer, but they are indiscriminate in what they catch.

Wildlife flourishing in uninhabited areas around Fukushima,"(CNN) Nearly a decade after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination.

On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes.

Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area.

A Japanese serow explores the area.

Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.

Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species -- including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.

China debuts train prototype that can hit speeds of 620 kilometers per hour,"(CNN) — China has revealed a prototype for a new high-speed Maglev train that is capable of reaching speeds of 620 kilometers (385 miles) per hour.

The train runs on high-temperature superconducting (HTS) power that makes it look as if the train is floating along the magnetized tracks.

The sleek 21-meter-long (69 feet) prototype was unveiled to media in the city of Chengdu, Sichuan Province, on January 13. In addition, university researchers constructed 165 meters (541 feet) of track to demonstrate how the train would look and feel in transit, according to state-run Xinhua News

Professor He Chuan (vice president of Southwest Jiaotong University, which worked on the prototype) told reporters that the train could be ""operational"" within 3-10 years.

He added: ""Sichuan has rich rare earth resources, which is very beneficial to our construction of permanent magnet tracks, thus promoting the faster development of experiments.""

China is home to the world's largest high-speed rail network, which stretches over 37,000 kilometers, and the fastest commercially operating train -- the Shanghai maglev.

The country's first high-speed Maglev train, it began operating in 2003. Running at a top speed of 431 kph, the train links Shanghai Pudong Airport and Longyang Road in the eastern side of Shanghai.



China has been eager to make further infrastructure improvements ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will take place in Beijing.

This time last year, China unveiled a new 174-kilometer high-speed railway line connecting Beijing with 2022 Winter Olympics host city Zhangjiakou, cutting the travel time between the two from three hours to 47 minutes.

Earlier this month, the country debuted a bullet train specifically designed to withstand freezing temperatures . The CR400AF-G train can travel up to 350 kilometers per hour in weather as cold as -40 degrees Celsius (-40 degrees Fahrenheit).",
A 5-story building in Shanghai 'walks' to a new location,"Shanghai residents passing through the city's eastern Huangpu district in October might have stumbled upon an unusual sight: a ""walking"" building.

An 85-year-old primary school has been lifted off the ground -- in its entirety -- and relocated using new technology dubbed the ""walking machine.""

In the city's latest effort to preserve historic structures, engineers attached nearly 200 mobile supports under the five-story building, according to Lan Wuji, chief technical supervisor of the project.

The supports act like robotic legs. They're split into two groups which alternately rise up and down, imitating the human stride. Attached sensors help control how the building moves forward, said Lan, whose company Shanghai Evolution Shift developed the new technology in 2018.

""It's like giving the building crutches so it can stand up and then walk,"" he said.

A timelapse shot by the company shows the school inching laboriously along, one tiny step at a time.

According to a statement from the Huangpu district government, the Lagena Primary School was constructed in 1935 by the municipal board of Shanghai's former French Concession. It was moved in order to make space for a new commercial and office complex, which will be completed by 2023.

Workers had to first dig around the building to install the 198 mobile supports in the spaces underneath, Lan explained. After the pillars of the building were truncated, the robotic ""legs"" were then extended upward, lifting the building before moving forward.

Over the course of 18 days, the building was rotated 21 degrees and moved 62 meters (203 feet) away to its new location. The relocation was completed on October 15, with the old school building set to become a center for heritage protection and cultural education.

The project marks the first time this ""walking machine"" method has been used in Shanghai to relocate a historical building, the government statement said.

Decades of destruction

In recent decades, China's rapid modernization has seen many historic buildings razed to clear land for gleaming skyscrapers and office buildings. But there has been growing concern about the architectural heritage lost as a result of demolition across the country.

Some cities have launched new preservation and conservation campaigns including, on occasion, the use of advanced technologies that allow old buildings to be relocated rather than demolished.

Official indifference toward historic architecture can be traced back to the rule of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong. During the disastrous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, innumerable historic buildings and monuments were destroyed as part of his war on the ""Four Olds"" (old customs, culture, habits and ideas).

Mao's death in 1976 saw calls for architectural conservation reemerge, with China's government granting protected status to a number of structures before passing a heritage preservation law in the 1980s. In the years that followed, buildings, neighborhoods and even entire towns were given state support to maintain their historic appearances.

Nonetheless, relentless urbanization has continued to pose a significant threat to architectural heritage. The sale of land is also a key source of revenue for local governments, meaning that buildings with architectural value are often sold off to property developers for whom conservation is not a priority.

In the capital Beijing, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of its historic alleys and traditional courtyard homes were destroyed between 1990 and 2010, according to state-run newspaper China Daily.

In the early 2000s, cities including Nanjing and Beijing -- prompted by critics protesting the loss of old neighborhoods -- drew up long-term plans to preserve what was left of their historic sites, with protections introduced to safeguard buildings and restrict developers.

These conservation efforts have taken different forms. In Beijing, a near-ruined temple was transformed into a restaurant and gallery, while in Nanjing, a cinema from the 1930s was restored to resemble its original form, with some additions outfitting it for modern use. In 2019, Shanghai welcomed Tank Shanghai, an arts center built in renovated oil tanks.

""Relocation is not the first choice, but better than demolition,"" said Lan, the Shanghai primary school's project supervisor. ""I'd rather not touch the historical buildings at all.""

He added that to relocate a monument, companies and developers have to go through strict regulations, such as getting approval from government at various levels.

Building relocations he said however, are ""a viable option."" ""The central government is putting more emphasis on the protection of historical buildings. I'm happy to see that progress in recent years.""

Moving monuments

Shanghai has arguably been China's most progressive city when it comes to heritage preservation. The survival of a number of 1930s buildings in the famous Bund district and 19th-century ""shikumen"" (or ""stone gate"") houses in the renovated Xintiandi neighborhood have offered examples of how to give old buildings new life, despite some criticism about how the redevelopments were carried out.

The city also has a track record of relocating old buildings. In 2003, the Shanghai Concert Hall, built in 1930, was moved over 66 metes (217 feet) to make way for an elevated highway. The Zhengguanghe Building -- a six-story warehouse, also from the 1930s -- was then shifted 125 feet (38 meters) as part of a local redevelopment in 2013.

There are a few ways to go about moving a building: It can slide down a set of rails, or be pulled along by vehicles, for instance.

But the Lagena Primary School, which weighs 7,600 tons, posed a new challenge -- it's T-shaped, whereas previously relocated structures were square or rectangular, according to Xinhua . The irregular shape meant that traditional methods of pulling or sliding may not have worked because it may not have withstood the lateral forces placed on it, said Lan.

The building also needed to be rotated and follow a curved route to its relocation instead of just moving in a straight line -- another challenge that required a new method.

""During my 23 years of working in this area, I haven't seen any other company that can move structures in a curve,"" he added.

Experts and technicians met to discuss possibilities and test a number of different technologies before deciding on the ""walking machine,"" Xinhua said.

Lan told CNN he couldn't share the exact cost of the project, and that relocation costs will differ case by case.

""It can't be used as a reference, because we have to preserve the historical building no matter what,"" he said. ""But in general, it's cheaper than demolishing and then rebuilding something in a new location.""",
Self-driving robotaxis are taking off in China,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) The world has been inching toward fully autonomous cars for years . In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.

On Thursday, AutoX, an-backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.

Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside.

This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn't restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.

The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city's downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin.

It also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.

""It's a dream,"" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. ""After working so hard for so many years, we've finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.""

Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. ""We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,"" he said. ""The AI software is better [now.]""

""From a technical point of view, the car is ready,"" Xiao said. ""It's very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.""

AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called ""Professor X."" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.

The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won't change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.

Race of the robotaxi

While AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it's not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.

In October, Alphabet's Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)

Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it's like to ride in a self-driving car.

This year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.

In June, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.

Baidu BIDU Recently, Chinese tech giantalso announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.

AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.

In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba's Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app.

The startup's latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.

Some of the company's lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.

""The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,"" he added. ""For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.""

China, home to the world's biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.

The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.

""The bar is incredibly high,"" he said. ""It's extremely challenging, but we're very happy.""",2020-12-03 00:00:00
Travel to Japan during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,"Editor's Note — Coronavirus cases remain high across the globe. Health officials caution that travel increases your chances of getting and spreading the virus. Staying home is the best way to stem transmission. Below is information on what to know if you still plan to travel, last updated on April 1.

(CNN) — If you're planning to travel to Japan, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The basics

Japan was lauded for containing the virus during the first wave but has seen a surge in cases, with a major spike in November and December.

Four prefectures -- Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba -- ended their emergency declarations on March 21. They were the last four prefectures to be under these declarations and re-opened about a week ahead of schedule.

Prime Minister Suga announced on February 9 that all foreign nationals would be barred from entering the country, but did not specify a start date or give details about how this would be implemented. While the Tokyo Olympics are still scheduled to take place in 2021, Reuters reports that it is highly likely that foreign residents would be barred from attending or being in the audience. The IOC and Japanese government will make an official announcement on the matter in early March.

Although all foreign nationals have been barred from attending the Olympics in summer 2021 and are mostly unable to enter the country, Japanese authorities announced that they are considering testing any foreigner entering the country for the newer coronavirus variants.

What's on offer

A heady mix of the cutting edge and deeply traditional, Japan remains a major draw for travelers from all over the globe. Whether participating in a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto, scouring Tokyo's Akihabara district for tech bargains or soaking in a hot onsen in the forests of Tohoku, this is a country that leaves its mark on all who visit.

Who can go

Japan has some of the most stringent travel restrictions in the world, with 152 countries on its prohibited list. Visitors from Australia, Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam may enter the country, although those traveling from China and South Korea can only arrive into the country via Tokyo Narita airport. Additionally, those traveling for study, work or to join family (subject to visa requirements) may enter. That said, there are many exceptions and the rules change constantly. Consult MOFA for the latest information.

Prime Minister Suga announced on January 14 that the borders would close to all foreign nationals, although there were no specifics on beginning and ending dates. He also did not specify whether this would apply to foreign citizens with Japanese residency.

What are the restrictions?

Travelers from permitted destinations must undertake a 14-day quarantine, although it is possible to request a PCR test on arrival. A negative result allows you to finish quarantine.

Those traveling under Japan's revised business travel rules will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure, signed and stamped by the laboratory where it was taken. While they will not need to self-isolate, they will need to provide details of their movements for the following two weeks and not use public transport.

What's the Covid situation?

After low infection rates in the first wave, Japan has seen a sharp increase in cases. The Japanese government's 'Go To Travel' scheme, which subsidized domestic tourism in a bid to boost the economy, has been blamed by some for the rise in positive infections.

Tokyo has been particularly hard hit. The capital recorded 599 on January 7, the single highest per-day number since the start of the pandemic. Since then, the daily infection rate has remained in the four figures daily.

On March 31, Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura announced that Japan was in serious danger of entering a ""fourth wave"" of infections, with 34 of 47 prefectures reporting a rise in cases. Osaka clocked 599 cases that day, its highest single-day total since January.

As of March 31, Japan has reported 471,777 confirmed cases of the virus and 9,112 deaths.

The vaccine rollout has been slow compared to others in Asia due to a shortage of medical professionals and a lack of syringes.

What can visitors expect?

While much of Japan remains open for business, cities are far quieter than usual and the government has the right to request the closure of businesses in areas of high transmission. Masks must be worn in public.

Sri Lanka reopens borders to international travelers,"(CNN) — The island nation of Sri Lanka is now open to tourists from all countries.

Sri Lanka Minister of Tourism Prasanna Ranatunga made the official announcement during a press conference on Thursday, confirming they would reopen the country's borders from January 21. Both of the country's international airports reopened on the same day.

""The livelihood of around 3 million people depends on tourism in Sri Lanka,"" Ranatunga told media. ""It is our national responsibility to take into consideration the needs of our citizens that depend on this industry.""

As part of efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Sri Lanka created a ""bio bubble,"" which will give visitors a relative amount of freedom to travel within the country while still observing safety protocols.

Though there is no minimum time that a visitor must spend in the country, anyone coming from abroad must stay in a government-approved hotel or resort for up to two weeks upon arrival.

That means that travelers only coming for a short trip will just stay in their resort the entire time, while people who are planning longer stays will be able to move more freely within Sri Lanka once they complete their two-weeks of semi-quarantine.

Unlike places like Hong Kong and Australia, where people quarantining upon arrival must stay in their hotel rooms for the entire duration, Sri Lanka's regulations are a bit laxer. Guests will have free rein on-property, so they can use facilities like pools, gyms, salons and restaurants.

Travelers can also leave the hotel during quarantine to go sightseeing, provided they do so carefully. About a dozen tourism sites and attractions are open to foreign visitors, but with caveats.

The five-star Anantara Peace Haven in Tangalle is on the list of approved hotels. Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle

For instance, as part of the ""bio bubble,"" attractions like Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) and the Royal Botanic Gardens, both in the central city of Kandy, require visitors to come as part of an organized tour group or with an approved Sri Lankan guide.

They must travel in a private vehicle and not make any unauthorized side stops. Some sites will only allow tourists during designated time slots or on certain days of the week.

Currently, 55 hotels and resorts fall under the ""safe and secure level one"" guidelines. They are not allowed to accept any local guests or host any events while they're part of the bio bubble.

With extra security comes extra fees.

In addition to paying for flights and accommodation, travelers are responsible for the cost of Sri Lanka's government-sanctioned health insurance ($12 US) and up to three Covid tests in-country ($40 each).

Everyone coming into the country must show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within 96 hours of travel and fill out an online health declaration form. Guests will be tested again at their own expense on the fifth and seventh days after arriving and people staying longer than seven days will have to take a third test the following week.

Once the two weeks are up and they have a negative coronavirus test, travelers can stay at their hotel or switch to another one of the approved hotels. Airbnbs, guest houses and other forms of accommodation are off limits. Taking public transit is discouraged.

All prospective travelers must apply for a visa online and download the Visit Sri Lanka app. The app will be used for contact tracing as well as storing information about test results and hotel bookings.

While nearly every country can demonstrably show that its tourism revenue had taken a hit amid the coronavirus pandemic, Sri Lanka has suffered from particularly unlucky timing.

A series of terrorist attacks in the capital of Colombo on Easter Sunday 2019 heavily dented the country's tourism scene, and Sri Lanka had just finished rebuilding its infrastructure when the pandemic hit.",
Singapore Airlines hopes to be world's first fully-vaccinated airline,"(CNN) — Singapore 's national carrier is hoping to become the world's first airline to get all of its crew members vaccinated against Covid-19.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) confirmed to CNN Travel that all of their crew members -- including pilots, gate agents, flight attendants and anyone whose job requires contact with the public -- have been offered free coronavirus vaccines by the Singaporean government.

The country has purchased the Pfizer vaccine , which requires two shots.

""We are grateful to the Singapore government for making the aviation sector a priority in the country's vaccination exercise,"" the airline's CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said in a statement that was emailed out to the whole company on January 18.

""This reflects the sector's importance, and the crucial role we play in both Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against the pandemic.""

According to the airline, 5,200 SIA employees have already signed up to get their shots. Inoculations will begin in a few days.

Phong, alongside Singapore's transport minister Ong Ye Kung, was among the city-state's first citizens to get vaccinated. He has received the first of his two shots, and reports that ""the procedure was painless and fuss-free.""

Once vaccinated, crew members will be subject to less scrutiny and fewer coronavirus-related security measures. For example, flight crew who are currently tested on the seventh day after their return to Singapore will be exempt from this test going forward.

Singapore's response to the pandemic has been largely successful due to border closures and a national contract-tracing app. The country has had 59,113 confirmed cases of the virus and only 29 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Still, citizens of the city-state have expressed an interest in being able to travel again. A much-hyped ""travel bubble"" with Hong Kong was indefinitely postponed in December when Hong Kong had a spike in virus cases.",

Travel News - CNN,How the letter X is changing the game for travelers — and what that could mean for the US,
"Know the difference between a tornado watch, a tornado warning and a tornado emergency","If you are in an area under a tornado warning, seek shelter immediately. Warnings can be issued with only a few minutes to prepare. Take them seriously -- it could save your life.

(CNN) Tornadoes are among the most destructive forces in nature. They can level well-built structures, uproot trees, toss semitrucks -- and be deadly.

They are most common in the US Plains and Southeast, but have been reported in all 50 states. They can happen anytime during the day or night, so knowing the difference between a tornado watch and warning could mean the difference between life and death.

The Storm Prediction Center and local National Weather Service offices closely monitor developing thunderstorms and will issue a watch or warning if the storm warrants an alert.

Tornado watch

A tornado watch is issued by the Storm Prediction Center. It means that conditions are favorable for a potential tornado. ""This highlights an area and usually alerts for the next four to six hours where risk is increasing,"" said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the prediction center.

If a tornado watch is issued, you should have your supplies, choose a safe place and have a plan in place -- just in case a tornado develops. This does not mean there is a tornado. This only means to be on watch and stay informed about the weather in your area in case things intensify.

Tornado warning

A tornado warning means a tornado has been sighted, or that there is a strong indication on radar that a tornado is in progress. ""When a particular area (is) under an immediate risk, then the local office will issue a warning and that's the call to action,"" said Bunting.

If a tornado warning is issued for your area, you should immediately seek shelter and get to your safe place until the tornado threat has passed. This means a tornado is imminent.

Simply put:

Tornado watch -- Be on watch in case storms strengthen. Be alert.

Tornado warning -- Take action. Seek shelter immediately. A tornado has been spotted or indicated by weather radar.

Stay tuned for more tips on how to take the best shelter in various places #txwx #ctxwx #dfwwx pic.twitter.com/ylDbSPtbTn — NWS Fort Worth (@NWSFortWorth) March 3, 2021

Some have used light-hearted ways to help explain the difference.

While there's nothing humorous about tornado alerts, if it helps remember the difference between a watch and a warning, then it's worth it.

Tornadoes kill an average of 75 to 80 people in the US every year and without these warnings in place, that number could be much greater, according to Bunting.

Tornado emergency

There's a third type of tornado alert that trumps them all. The tornado emergency was added in 1999 and it's basically a tornado warning on steroids. If a tornado is in progress and will have a significant impact to human life, with catastrophic destruction to property, a tornado emergency will be issued.

This is the highest alert level given to a tornado event. ""It was an idea that came to the staff during a critical moment when a violent tornado moved into an area,"" said Bunting.

He's talking about the Moore, Oklahoma, tornado in May 1999. It was a violent EF5 tornado that killed 36 people. It had the strongest winds ever recorded on the planet at 301 mph.

""It's the strongest message we can send out of the office. it's a way to amplify the message best we can,"" said Bunting.

The Storm Prediction Center urges people not to wait for a tornado emergency to be issued to take action. Take every storm seriously. They can change intensity quickly.

The center and the National Weather Service has spent countless hours trying to educate the public about the difference in these two terms, but many times there is still confusion when a tornado alert is issued.

That's especially true for someone who has recently moved from an area that doesn't experience many tornadoes. That's why having a safety plan in place is key. ""Often times the minutes you save by getting into a safe place can make the difference in life and death,"" said Bunting.

Tornado safety

First and foremost, you and your family should have a plan in place in case there is ever a tornado warning issued for your area. Have a small interior room or closet on the lowest level of your home designated as your tornado safe place.

There should be no windows in the room and it should be away from any outside walls. It's a good idea to have a flashlight and a way to receive alerts while in the room. This could be in the form of a weather radio or your smartphone. Also make sure every family member has a helmet and shoes in the room.

""When a warning is issued is not the time to think about a safely plan. Put that in now so you know what to do when a warning is issued,"" said Bunting.",2021-03-11 00:00:00
Here is why March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb (usually),"(CNN) If March's weather is anything like what roared through Texas and the rest of the central and southern US in February... we're in deep trouble. Often, March's weather can be this ferocious.

Have you ever heard of the saying, ""March comes in like a Lion and goes out like a Lamb""?

While the saying most likely started as a reference to astronomy, referencing the position of the constellations Leo (a lion) and Aries (a ram, or lamb) in the night sky -- it quickly evolved into a succinct summation of March's changing weather as the seasons change from winter to spring in the Northern Hemisphere.

This well-known proverb means that March is a month in which you can experience a Lion's fierce roar of frigid cold, the long white teeth of biting winds that can cut through flesh; and the gentle softness, the warmth of fluffy white fleece, and the innocent kiss of sunshine like a docile newborn lamb.

It turns out proverbs like this one hold a lot of weight, and are many times accurate. Here is why.

The proverb has stood the test of time

Like many proverbs for the month of March, it can be traced back to Thomas Fuller's 1732 compendium, ""Gnomologia; Adagies and Proverbs; Wise Sentences and Witty Sayings, Ancient and Modern, Foreign and British.""

Fuller compiled numerous proverbs and studied weather lore across many countries through the late 1600s and early 1700s.

JUST WATCHED How useful is the Farmer's Almanac? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How useful is the Farmer's Almanac? 01:04

Weather folklore contained in books like Fuller's were often ways to help people prepare for typical weather conditions that lay ahead, often times in reference to planting and harvesting of crops, and can often be accurate, thanks to prevailing winds and weather patterns.

Typically across the US, the month of March is still in the grip of harsh winter realms, providing more of the same brutal cold, wind and snow, especially in the first days of the month. But as the transitional month moves along, it often leads to glimpses of spring's beauty and warmth.

In the beginning, it might not have had anything to do with weather

This proverb may have evolved into the weather saying we have today by first relating to the heavenly stars above. It is believed that this saying has more to do with the month beginning with the constellation Leo. Leo (the lion) rises in the east to start March and ends the month with the constellation Aries (the ram, or lamb) setting in the west.

It is believed that this saying was adapted to include the weather, with its wild swings we generally expect for this transitional month.

It didn't take long for early American colonists to realize that the New World's weather pattern was much like their native lands across England and surrounding countries, where extreme weather shifts could profoundly affect their livelihoods from one week to the next.

The Northern Hemisphere shares the same jet stream, providing similar swings in weather, in America as they do across Europe.

A similar pattern of mainly westerly influence with cold, harsh north winds bringing heavy snow and bitterly cold temperatures are common in winter, while warm winds from the south can bring tranquil warmth more frequently as the month progresses.

Different variations developed for different locations

Some may be familiar with a reverse version of the proverb: ""March comes in like a lamb and goes out like a lion.""

This ""reverse"" of the proverb is hard to trace in its origin, but definitely makes sense if you consider those who traveled westward with the American expansion to Western states.

These western states can have incredible temperature swings this month as the polar jet stream moves from it's preferred position near Canada over the winter to a more southerly route during the spring. This tends to cause many states in the Western US to experience some of their heavier snowfalls from the end of March and into April -- thus the lion (and the harsh weather it represents) coming at the end of the month.

In Scotland they say, ""March comes in with adders' heads and goes out with peacocks' tails."" An Adder is Scotland's sole venomous snake. A timid creature and unlikely to bite unless threatened. Again, showing a feared image of winter, with the beauty and splendor the weather at the end of March can bring.

In the Netherlands, they say; ""Maart roert zijn staart,"" which means ""March stirs its tail"" -- evidence of the variety and extremes that can come day to day this time of year. All the same for the roller coaster of wacky weather we call March.

The history of weather lore

Weather proverbs have been passed down from generation to generation. A simple saying, a rhyme, a limerick, etc., help us forecast the weather for the coming days or season.

Many are Old English in origin that have found their way to America and the early colonists searching for a new world.

Weather proverbs also originate from days gone by from almost every country in the world. But, only those with similar weather patterns usually hold true where you live.

Weather lore itself can be traced to Greek philosophers' works; those who studied the stars and astrology; those who studied the seas for navigation and the winds to farm.

Many are geared toward certain months of the year, and some for ""days of the year"" as in those for patron saints, thanks to the Middle Ages. Whether it was the farmer in a field, the sailor on a ship or the poet in the woods ... these proverbs continue to ring true.

As the month of March continues, will the 'Luck of the Irish' be with us? We'll have to wait and see.",2021-03-02 00:00:00

The year was 2011, when a moderate La Niña weather pattern and an active jet stream generated the scenario that's almost identical to what we've experienced so far in 2021

The weather events that followed 2011's extreme cold snap now have meteorologists concerned that the US could be in for above-normal tornado activity this spring

The past few months have seen the strongest La Niña signal since the winter of 2010-2011. So, the question is whether this spring continues to mirror that year, which ended up the costliest on record for tornadoes and the deadliest in nearly 100 years.

""Severe weather season is really a collection of several short weather events, and anticipating individual events at long lead times is usually tricky,"" Sam Lillo, atmospheric researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CNN.

""What we can say instead is whether the probability of the ingredients coming together for these events is higher or lower than normal: This year, it is higher than normal.""

The deadliest tornado season in modern history

The remarkable tornado season of 2011 was the deadliest in modern times, with over 550 fatalities -- second only to 1925's total of 794 tornado deaths.

Almost all the deaths in 2011 occurred during the extremely active months of April and May. That April alone saw 875 confirmed tornadoes , more than any month on record. The Super Outbreak on April 27 recorded 226 tornadoes, the most tornadoes ever observed on a single day, including destructive twisters in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

Just a few weeks later, Joplin, Missouri was hit with a top-scale EF5 tornado that killed more than 160 people. It was the deadliest tornado in over 60 years, as well as the costliest tornado on record , with nearly $3 billion in direct damages.

""Looking back on 2011, it was the sheer magnitude of the number of events, the fact that so many hit populated areas and, of course, the incredibly high toll in terms of deaths, injuries and dollar damage,"" said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations for the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center (SPC).

While localized and small-scale weather features played roles in setting up both of these tragic days, the overall large-scale weather patterns that fed into the historic 2011 tornado season are worth looking at to determine the risk for similar days this year.

""Every year has some potential (of tornado outbreaks); it's just a matter of trying to accurately predict, with as much lead time as possible, where that area is likely to be and then making sure that people are prepared and have a plan,"" Bunting said.

Active forecast for this spring

To paint a picture of what the coming weeks' to months' weather may look like, forecasters look to La Niña and other global climate and weather patterns, such as the Arctic Oscillation (which is different than the polar vortex ), to craft what are called subseasonal forecasts.

Lillo runs one of these models that ""focuses on the slow, predictable parts of the atmosphere"" to create forecasts several weeks in advance. Prediction models like it are important for things like seasonal forecasts of temperatures , which are used in energy trading markets, and hurricane season forecasts released each year by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Lillo's model recently predicted -- with a month of lead time -- the Arctic outbreak that gripped the central US this February. Now, the focus shifts to what these long-term patterns could reveal as we head into the spring severe storm season.

""In general, the forecasts are showing ridging with above-normal temperatures in the South, cooler to the north, and that temperature gradient enhancing the jet stream across the center of the US,"" Lillo said. (The jet stream is the main storm track across the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and divides colder air to the north and warmer air to the south.)

During La Niña, stronger temperature differences tend to develop between hot and humid air in the southern US and cooler, drier air to the north. This sets up a faster jet stream that can drive severe weather outbreaks.

""The faster jet stream holds all the potential for stronger storm systems and severe weather,"" Lillo said.

In March, the southern US is historically the area where severe storms, including tornadoes, are more likely. Then, as the Northern Hemisphere begins to warm, the bull's-eye for tornadoes will shift west into the central US and eventually north into the northern Plains, come summer.

""The jet stream pattern is not unfavorable for severe weather as we get a little bit later into March and certainly beyond,"" Bunting said. ""If that pattern holds, very strong wind fields down across the Gulf Coast in proximity to warm, moist air suggest that the Gulf Coast in the near-term may be an area to watch closely.""

How La Niña relates to tornadoes

Similar to this year, a moderate La Niña was the main feature in 2011. La Niña, and its counterpart, El Niño, can play a significant role in the position of the jet stream, temperature and precipitation patterns over the US, which all play a role in the formation of severe weather.

The El Niño or La Niña conditions in winter months can be used to help pinpoint the tornado frequency during the peak of severe storm season in the spring, recent studies have found.

""The flow of warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico increases in strength during springs that follow La Niña, which produces the fuel needed to form storms,"" Jason Furtado, assistant professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, said.

""The stronger flow increases the low-level wind shear that also favors the formation of tornadoes and hailstorms.""

The past several months have featured the strongest La Niña since 2011, and this pattern is expected to continue to impact weather over the next several months , through the heart of severe weather season, according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.

The time to prepare is now

While severe storms occur year-round in the US, the peak time for severe storm outbreaks is during meteorological spring, which includes March, April and May.

So far this year, there have only been 27 tornado reports , which is well below normal. Over the last 15 years, the US has averaged around 130 tornado reports through the first few days of March.

But it's not just tornado reports that are down. Hail and damaging wind reports are also below average so far this year.

""There have been many seasons that have started out quiet and did just the opposite,"" Bunting said.

2011 also started below average for both tornado and hail reports through much of March, according to data compiled by the SPC , before rapidly accelerating through the remainder of the spring.

The upcoming forecast relies on where the jet stream will end up in the coming weeks.

Now is the time to review your severe weather plans. Know where to find your daily local forecast . Have multiple ways of getting severe storm and tornado watches and warnings: via Wireless Emergency Alerts NOAA Weather Radio , local news stations and more. And know where to shelter at home, work or school if a tornado strikes.

Here's why the US has more tornadoes than any other country,"(CNN) The US averages over 1,150 tornadoes every year. That's more than any other country. In fact, it's more than Canada, Australia and all European countries combined.

Within the US, every state has had at least one tornado, and some have dozens each year.

The US is special in terms of producing so many tornadoes, especially violent ones.

In the US, the average number of tornado fatalities per year is 73. But in Europe, where the tornadoes are usually much weaker, the fatalities are estimated to be between 10 and 15 annually.

Some states are deadlier than others

Texas on average has 140 tornadoes every year --the most of any state. Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Nebraska round out the top five.

But the total number of tornadoes does not always tell the whole story. For example, despite Alabama having on average 42 tornadoes per year -- more than three times fewer than Texas -- it is at the top of the list for tornado fatalities.

Alabama averages 14 tornado fatalities per year, almost double the next highest -- Missouri with eight deaths per year.

The time of day and the topography where the tornado occurs makes a big difference in the fatality rate.

The topography in Alabama and other Southern states often includes rolling hills, plateaus, and many more trees than the Plains states like Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska, where a tornado often can be seen from miles away. The more likely a tornado can be seen often leads to the tornado being reported faster, allowing more time for people to be warned and seek shelter.

Southern states such as Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas also see more tornadoes overnight versus any other state. This can lead to higher fatalities, since many people are sleeping and unaware that a tornado is approaching.

""Tornadoes in the Southeast tend to be more dangerous than their Great Plains counterparts,"" says Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologist. ""There are a number of reasons for this, some weather and some geographic. Southeastern tornadoes often travel faster, moved by a faster jet stream.""

All of these factors can lead to higher fatality rate in Southern states compared to the Plains. But all of these states have a few things in common: the ideal atmospheric conditions for tornadoes to form.

""The basic ingredients for severe thunderstorms that can make tornadoes are warm, moist air near the ground, relatively dry, cool air aloft (about 10,000 to 30,000 feet), and horizontal winds in the environment the storm forms in that increase as you go from the ground up and change direction with height, blowing from the equator near the ground and from the west aloft,"" says Dr. Harold Brooks, senior scientist with the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory.

Low pressure systems in the US pull warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air aloft from the Rocky Mountains or the High Desert in the southwest. The states that fall in between those two regions end up being in the ideal location for severe weather to ignite.

""No place else in the world has the large warm water on its equatorward side with a wide high range of mountains extending from north to south to the west of it,"" Dr. Brooks said. ""All the other tornado prone regions have at least one feature suboptimal.""

The US leads every other country for tornadoes

Other countries experience tornadoes, including Germany, Australia, South Africa, eastern China, Japan, Bangladesh, Argentina, and more.

Europe as a whole is comparable to the size of the US, but there is a vast difference in number of tornadoes and tornado fatalities.

From 2011 to 2020, the US averaged a preliminary total of 1,173 tornadoes per year, and Europe around 256. However, Dr. Pieter Groenemeijer, Director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL), cautions that the European number may be on the low side.

""Weaker tornadoes are likely still under-reported in some countries, such as France and the UK,"" Groenemeijer says.

European Russia (which is the part of the country west of 58 degrees East longitude), tops the list at 86 tornadoes annually. Germany comes in second with an average 28 tornadoes annually.

The peak density of tornado reports coincides with the high population density over Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, according to a study on severe storms in Europe published in December 2020

The study also reports that thunderstorms are twice as frequent over the United States, with as many as four times more storm reports, compared to Europe.

One thing most countries have in common is the time of day that tornadoes occur, which is most frequently during the afternoon and early evening. But the peak season is not the same. In the US, spring is the peak for tornado activity. For central and northern Europe the main tornado season is in summer, whereas it is autumn for the western and central Mediterranean region, and winter in the eastern Mediterranean.

Outside of the US, Canada actually ranks second on the list for most tornadoes, with an average of 100 per year

Tornadoes are not limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Australia has dozens every year, and South Africa also reports annual occurrences . South America, much like other continents, has its own tornado hotspot, known as ""pasillo de los tornados."" This tornado corridor includes Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and a portion of Brazil.

According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, tornadoes are relatively rare there. On average, around seven to 10 moderate to strong tornado events are reported in New Zealand every year.

Tornado safety tips that could save your life,"Editor’s Note: If you are in an area under a tornado warning, seek shelter immediately. Warnings can be issued with only a few minutes to prepare. Take them seriously— it could save your life.

(CNN) —

They can happen at any time and threaten every corner of the United States. It is time to prepare for one of the world’s most destructive types of weather: tornadoes.

On average, the United States sees more than 1,200 tornadoes per year, far more than any country in the world.

While tornadoes can be deadly, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones before, during and after disaster strikes.

1. Get alerts

00:59 - Source: CNN The difference between a tornado watch and a warning

First things first: Understand the difference between a tornado watch and tornado warning, and be able to identify your city and county on a map.

Outdoor sirens – While sirens can be useful, they are not always the best way to receive tornado warnings, since they are not widespread.

Local television – Local stations will provide on-air coverage for your area during severe weather, but the TV won’t wake you up if a tornado warning occurs at night.

NOAA Weather Radio – While it may sound old-fashioned, – While it may sound old-fashioned, a weather radio will provide you with up-to-date information straight from your nearest National Weather Service forecasting office.

Mobile phone – Wireless emergency alerts are one of the best ways to receive tornado warnings anytime, anyplace. In an IOS device go to settings, then notifications, and scroll to the bottom. Make sure emergency alerts – listed under government alerts – are clicked on. If you use a third-party app, be sure the alerts are issued in a timely fashion. Most importantly, have those notifications ON.

2. Know the safest places to shelter

There are a few places that will keep you the most sheltered in a tornado.

Underground – A basement or cellar is the safest place to protect yourself from a tornado’s violent winds.

The first floor in an interior room – In a home, this place could be a bathroom or closet with no windows. Put as many walls between you and the outdoors as possible.

Things can get a little more complicated if you don’t have access to a permanent structure.

Mobile homes – Trailers are light and will easily topple in strong winds, so they are one of the worst places to be during a tornado. If you receive a tornado warning while you are in a mobile home, you should go to the closest sturdy building. If a reliable shelter is not available, the next best option is to lie in a ditch and protect your head from flying debris.

Cars – The National Weather Service emphasizes that a vehicle is not a safe place to be if a tornado threatens you. Although this is true, one study found that people belted in a car are generally safer than those who stay in a mobile home. So, if you are in a vehicle during a tornado warning, exiting your vehicle and seeking shelter in the closest permanent structure is the best option. If that is not possible, experts suggest you either buckle your seatbelt and crouch down in your car or abandon your vehicle and lie in a nearby ditch.

Be sure your plan is updated and works at all times. If you plan to seek shelter in a public building, make sure it is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Your plans need to work at any time of the day or night.

3. Avoid dangerous places

Under highway overpasses – Sheltering under a bridge may seem like a good option if you are stuck in your car, but the narrow passage can act like a funnel and – Sheltering under a bridge may seem like a good option if you are stuck in your car, but the narrow passage can act like a funnel and amplify winds

Outdoors – There are no safe options if you are stuck outside during a tornado warning with no permanent shelter nearby. As an absolute last resort, stay away from trees or other free-standing objects, crouch down in the lowest-lying area you can find, and cover your head.

Upper-level floors – If you live on an upper floor of an apartment building or work in a tall office building, find a way to seek shelter on the first floor safely. An interior hallway can be a safe bet.

Warehouses, department stores, grocery stores – Structures with large open spaces are particularly vulnerable to collapse, – Structures with large open spaces are particularly vulnerable to collapse, even in relatively weak tornadoes . If possible, find a small, enclosed area to shelter in, and avoid the building’s outer walls.

Tornadoes Fast Facts,"(CNN) —

Here’s some background information about tornadoes, rotating columns of air that often, but not always, are visible as funnel clouds. According to the National Weather Service, in 2020 there were 76 tornado-related deaths in the United States.

Facts

Most tornadoes form from severe thunderstorms. Hurricanes can also produce tornadoes.

Tornado winds may exceed 300 miles (483 kilometers) per hour.

Tornadoes can lift cars, mobile homes and animals into the air.

Tornadoes are sometimes called “twisters.”

On average, tornadoes travel at around 10-20 miles per hour.

The average tornado is on the ground about five minutes.

The most destructive and deadly tornadoes occur from supercells, which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a mesocyclone. Supercells can also produce damaging hail, severe non-tornadic winds, unusually frequent lightning, and flash floods.

A tornado over a body of water is called a “waterspout.”

The United States has the highest number of tornado occurrences in the world with an average of more than 1,000 tornadoes reported each year.

A disproportionately high frequency of tornadoes occurs in Florida and a region called “Tornado Alley,” which spans across the central southern plans.

Tornadoes usually occur during the spring and early summer, most often in the late afternoon and early evening.

A tornado watch is issued by the National Weather Service when atmospheric conditions promote the forming of tornadoes.

A tornado warning is issued when Doppler radar detects a mesocyclone in a thunderstorm or when a funnel cloud has been spotted.

A tornado emergency is enhanced wording in a tornado warning indicating a large tornado is moving into a heavily populated area. A severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage from a tornado is imminent or ongoing. The term was coined by forecasters in May 1999 and is used sparingly.

Enhanced Fujita Scale

The Enhanced Fujita scale became operational on February 1, 2007. It is used to assign a tornado a rating based on estimated wind speed and damage the tornado causes.

EF0 is the weakest point on the Enhanced Fujita Scale and EF5 is the strongest.

"Climate change is increasing flood risk around the country. Insurance rates are not keeping pace, report finds","(CNN) Wildfires and hurricane-force winds produce stunning videos and headlines, but flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States.

And almost no place in the country is immune as 98% of all counties in the US have experienced at least one flooding event. In the last decade alone, floods have caused more than $155 billion worth of damage , according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

As the climate changes, the risk of financial loss from flooding for millions of homeowners is increasing

Currently, there are nearly 4.3 million residential properties around the country with a substantial risk of financial loss due to flooding. The report defines ""substantial risk"" as carrying a 1% chance of flooding in any year.

Some, but not all, of those homeowners have insurance through the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides more than 90% of the flood insurance policies in the US

But the report finds that those homes face losses each year which dwarf the costs of their NFIP premiums. The average NFIP premium cost today for those properties is around $981 , but their expected annual loses are $4,694 per property.

If all of those property owners were to purchase flood insurance to protect against potential damage, premiums would need to increase by 4.5 times to cover the risk.

The analysis was conducted by the First Street Foundation , a non-profit research and technology group that aims to shed light on the growing risk of flooding around the country due to climate change.

The study only considered residential properties with between one and four units, but the authors say the actual financial risk from flooding around the country is likely far greater than the report captures.

""Our numbers are large ... but it's not encompassing all properties that are inside the Special Flood Hazard Area, or many other residential properties like condos, apartment buildings and other larger buildings,"" said Matthew Eby, founder and executive director of the First Street Foundation. ""So if you take that and you extrapolate, there are actually a lot more buildings that have financial risk as well.""

separate report from the foundation last year estimated that there are a total of 14.6 million properties around the country with substantial flood risk. The owners of around 5.9 million of those properties may be unaware of their flood risk because they are located outside of FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), and therefore aren't required to buy flood insurance even if they hold a government-backed mortgage loan, the report found.

Today, the 4.3 million homes with a 1% chance of flooding carry an expected annual loss of $20.8 billion due to flood damage, the foundation's analysis found.

However, within the life of a 30-year mortgage signed today, those losses are projected to balloon by 61% to nearly $32.2 billion per year by 2050 due to the effects of climate change.

As massive storms like Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey and Sandy have hammered some of the country's biggest coastal cities, the NFIP's bottom line has already taken a beating.

Today, the program is saddled with more than $20.5 billion in debt, according to a recent Congressional Review Service Report . That's after Congress canceled $16 billion of the NFIP's debt in 2017 to allow the program to pay claims to victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.

""With climate change and more development and more properties at risk, it just keeps going further in the hole,"" said Sandra Knight, a senior research engineer at the University of Maryland's Center for Disaster Resilience and a former FEMA administrator. ""That tells you you're not collecting enough premiums, but the long-term game is to have zoning and building codes that minimize risk. You can't just depend on insurance.""

Experts and even FEMA officials have acknowledged for years that there are shortcomings with the NFIP as it is currently structured.

Chief among those is the process of drawing FEMA's flood maps, which provide the basis for setting insurance rates for many policies under the NFIP.

And though FEMA maps are required by Congress to be reassessed every five years, Grimm says it takes seven years on average to complete a new flood map , meaning that some maps may technically be out of date by the time they're finished.

An emergency worker helps evacuate people stranded by flooding during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. A new report finds that the risk of financial loss for homeowners due to flooding is expected to grow as the climate changes

Insurance rate setting under the NFIP has seen little change since the 1970s

The rates are set depending on which of three broad types of flood zones a property sits in : low to moderate risk, high risk or high risk coastal area. The type of property, the elevation of the building, the number of floors and whether it has a basement are also factored in.

But experts say the use of these flood zones is an unsophisticated way to gauge risk that doesn't take into account key considerations, like the topography of the land where a property sits. FEMA's flood models only factor in the risk of storm surge and river flooding , not the threat posed by heavy rainfall.

""It's actually sort of a crude way to price flood risk because it doesn't account for changing flood risk across a landscape,"" said Carolyn Kousky, the executive director of the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the advisory board for the First Street Foundation.

To address these problems, FEMA is expected to roll out a new system for setting flood insurance rates later this year called Risk Rating 2.0 , which the agency says will utilize the latest technology to better capture the risk for each individual property.

David Maurstad, the senior executive of the National Flood Insurance Program, said that the First Street Foundation's findings should not be taken as a preview of the rate changes flood insurance policy holders can expect when Risk Rating 2.0 goes into effect.

""Any attempt to compare an outside entity's premium estimates or premium recommendations to the Risk Rating 2.0 initiative is premature,"" Maurstad said in an emailed statement. ""FEMA is constantly working to leverage new technologies and provide national-scale flood risk information more efficiently, accurately and consistently to the public.""

Still, Kousky says that the new findings are an important indicator of just how much the cost of flood damage could grow around the country as the climate changes, which the cost of insurance in any single year does not capture.

""It certainly has shown how much flood losses are going to start increasing as a result of climate change,"" she said. ""That should be a red flag for the NFIP and communities everywhere that the cost of this risk are going up. And that means to stay solvent, insurance costs have to go up as well.""",2021-02-22 00:00:00
Hurricanes are becoming more dangerous. Here’s why,"Here’s what scientists are most confident is happening to hurricanes as a result of climate change, what they think might be occurring and the biggest questions about how these massive storms are changing that remain unanswered.

While scientists are still learning exactly how this added heat is changing hurricanes, research shows that the storms are becoming more destructive in some key ways.

Though global temperature data goes back over 150 years, hurricane records are actually very sparse prior to the 1970s, when satellites first began capturing images of all of the world’s oceans.

In 1961, Hurricane Esther became the first storm to be recorded by a weather satellite.

The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record , and many of the storms that slammed into the Gulf Coast, Central America and the Caribbean this year exhibited hallmark signs that they were supercharged by global warming.

Over the last two-plus centuries, human activity — mainly the burning of fossil fuels – has added lots of heat to the oceans and air where these storms are spawned.

This heat energy is converted into lashing winds and driving rainfall that can bring devastating impacts when they hit cities, homes and infrastructure.

Known outside of North America as tropical cyclones or typhoons, hurricanes are essentially massive engines of wind and rain that are fueled by warm ocean water and air.

Hurricanes are the most violent storms on the planet. The names of the most damaging ones live on because of the devastation they left in their wake.

And when storm surge strikes a developed coastline, the cost in both lives and property can be enormous.

When a storm’s winds blow onshore, they can send feet of water rushing inland at depths far greater than even the most extreme high tides.

Storm surge is the rapid rise in ocean levels brought about by the powerful winds and low pressure in a hurricane.

Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds, but the most deadly and destructive threat posed by most hurricanes is the storm surge they can produce .

What scientists know for sure

Note: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.

With global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.

Already, storm surge has gotten worse because sea levels are rising - and fast.

Sea level rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland storm surge can travel.

During the height of Hurricane Dorian , Michael Pintard, Bahamas’ Minister of Agriculture, recorded this video from the second story of his house. Water is seen lapping against the windows, which he estimates in the video to be nearly 20 feet high.

While no tide gauge measurements were available in the hardest-hit parts of the Bahamas when Hurricane Dorian struck in 2019, witnesses reported that the storm put parts of the islands under as much as 20 feet of water .

Scientists now say sea levels could rise by more than three feet by 2100.

As sea levels continue to rise this century, the storm surge risk to the city will also grow.

Here's what 2 feet of sea level rise would look like.

But with 1 foot of sea level rise, parts of it would be underwater.

Low-lying cities like Charleston, South Carolina, are already vulnerable to storm surge.

However, there have been several recent storms that provide anecdotal evidence.

But because observation stations that monitor rainfall are sparse and hurricane satellite data only goes back a few decades, we can’t yet draw conclusions about how much climate change has affected rainfall, said Kossin.

Computer models consistently show that hurricane rainfall is increasing already, as one would expect as the planet warms.

That would mean that in a world warmed by two degrees Celsius, you would have, on average, around 14% more water vapor in the atmosphere.

“Simply put, warmer air holds more water vapor,” said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist at NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information.

The increase in hurricane rainfall can be explained by physics — specifically, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which holds that for each degree Celsius of warming, 7% more water vapor should be available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain.

In the Southeastern US alone, the annual cost of storm surge damage is projected to grow to $56 billion by 2050 , according to the US government’s 2018 National Climate Assessment. And that’s even if global emissions of heat-trapping gases are moderately curbed in the next two decades.

Generally speaking, a rise in sea levels of 2 to 3 feet would mean that a Category 1 hurricane could be capable of inflicting the kind of storm surge damage we would expect today from a Category 2 storm.

If humans continue to emit heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, scientists expect that sea levels will climb even higher , putting major cities at an even greater risk.

“This is making the storms more dangerous as it leads to higher inundation levels,” said Tom Knutson, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who leads the agency’s weather and climate dynamics division.

This added heat is likely allowing hurricanes to pack even greater wind speeds.

What scientists think they know

The following year, Hurricane Florence swamped parts of North Carolina with nearly three feet of rain , shattering the state’s previous record for tropical storm rainfall.

Hurricane Michael, which made landfall as a Category 5 storm on Oct. 10, 2018, underwent rapid intensification before striking the Florida panhandle.

“If you increase the speed limit, you make more room for the storms to strengthen, so it can intensify more quickly,” said Kossin.

Rapid intensification is when a storm quickly gains strength – officially, a storm has undergone rapid intensification if its wind speeds increase by at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period.

And as warming reaches deeper and deeper stretches of the world’s oceans, scientists believe that storms are more likely to undergo “rapid intensification.”

As human activity warms up the planet, the extra heat isn’t just confined to the ocean’s surface — it extends hundreds of meters deep , providing extra heat energy for hurricanes to use for fuel.

Other variables — like the presence of El Nino and La Nina conditions – can also cause significant swings in how hurricanes form around the world. Because of this, scientists say more data is needed before we can say with certainty how climate change will impact hurricanes’ strength now and in the future.

“Almost all of the damage and mortality caused by hurricanes is done by major hurricanes (Category 3 to 5),” Kossin said. “Increasing the likelihood of having a major hurricane will certainly increase this risk.”

With stronger storms, there’s also a greater chance for severe damage and destruction when hurricanes collide with towns and cities.

“The prevailing consensus is that we likely won’t see more storms in the future (maybe even fewer), but that these storms may be stronger,” Klotzbach said. “If you look at the (hurricane) trend since 1980 (when reliable data became available), there’s a huge increasing trend in Category 4s and 5s.”

Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University who monitors and analyzes hurricane trends across the globe, draws similar conclusions about how climate change is increasing hurricanes’ strength.

“The change is about 8% per decade,” Kossin said. “In other words, during its lifetime, a hurricane is 8% more likely to be a major hurricane in this decade compared to the last decade.”

In a study released earlier this year examining nearly 40 years of available satellite data , Kossin and his co-authors found that the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status (Category 3 or above with winds in excess of 110 mph or higher), increased decade after decade.

“The stronger storms are getting stronger,” he warned, “and the stronger storms are becoming more frequent.”

“But that is not what is really important,” Kossin said. The added heat in the oceans is “increasing the speed limit for storms,” raising the maximum intensity that storms can achieve.

“We have relatively high confidence that storms will get stronger,” said Kossin. Both he and Knutson estimated the increase in the wind speeds to be between about 3% and 4% per degree Celsius of warming.

While some recent research has shown this trend, scientists say not enough historical data exists to say how much more common rapid intensification has become.

Then in November, Hurricanes Eta and Iota both rapidly gained strength before making landfall in Central America just weeks apart, with Iota becoming the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua . The fact that there were water temperatures warm enough to allow both storms to rapidly intensify this late in the season is a clear signal of global warming, Klotzbach said.

Three of the most damaging hurricanes to strike the US in 2020 — Hanna, Laura and Sally — all rapidly intensified before making landfall.

From satellite imagery, you can see how Michael’s eye quickly became more defined and organized as it approached the coast, a sign that the storm was gaining strength:

All this extra heat gives hurricanes more fuel to gain strength rapidly.

But as the planet has warmed, heat in the ocean now extends further below the surface.

Wind and rain churn up the ocean below a hurricane, causing cooler waters from the depths to mix with warmer, surface water. This tends to limit how much a storm can strengthen.

Hurricanes are fueled by heat energy from warm ocean waters. As a storm moves over the ocean, it pulls in energy from the water's surface.

“The tropics are expanding — so it seems to reason that the tropical cyclones would be able to extend further into the mid-latitudes,” Kossin said, “and when we looked at the data were able to see this shift.”

According to Kossin, who has published multiple studies on the topic, there is a growing body of evidence that there “has been a systematic shift in the storm track that is not easily explained by natural causes.” In the Northern Hemisphere, this means storms are tracking further north and in the Southern Hemisphere, further south.

Though scientists say more evidence is needed, some findings in recent years show that more storms are reaching their peak intensities closer to the poles, potentially putting more cities within range of a major hurricane landfall.

An identical storm will produce much more destruction if it makes landfall in a major coastal city in the mid-latitudes – say New York, Shanghai or Brisbane — than if it slams into a sparsely populated coastline elsewhere.

To borrow a real estate adage, it’s “location, location, location” that also determines just how much damage a hurricane or typhoon can inflict.

What scientists are just starting to learn

“We used to observe storms less frequently and with satellites that had lower resolution, and consequently, we likely couldn’t measure rapid intensification as well as we can now,” Klotzbach told CNN.

Klotzbach also noted that while the data shows an increase in the number of storms that have rapidly intensified, it also shows an increasing number of storms have rapidly weakened — indicating the increases could also be a function of advances in the amount and quality of data we are now able to collect on storms.

This shift in where storms strike could have an even larger impact on the threats hurricanes pose than increases in storm intensity due to climate change, Kossin said.

Major cities that do not have a history of dealing with tropical storms, especially at or near peak intensity, could be seeing them on a more regular basis in future decades, Kossin said.

Heavily populated shorelines in northeastern China and Japan are seeing storms with 2 to 3 times the frequency they were in earlier decades, while low-lying archipelagos like the Philippines are seeing storms less frequently than we’d expect, he said.

The one place where hurricane tracking data hasn’t shown much of a northward shift is in the Atlantic Basin.

Most scientists, Kossin included, attribute this to some longer-term variabilities that are both natural and human caused. Kossin believes the Atlantic will likely see this poleward shift in the track of storms too, but so far, it has not materialized.

More storms are stalling. That’s a big problem

The slower a storm moves, the more time its winds and rain can inflict damage.

In 2019, Hurricane Dorian’s devastating crawl across the Bahamas slowed to 1 mph, slower than the speed at which most humans walk. The slowdown kept the island of Grand Bahama in Dorian’s eye for more than nine hours.

The lashing winds and torrential downpours from Hurricanes Harvey and Florence also slowed to a crawl on land.

As the planet warms, scientists say more and more storms appear to be experiencing this slowdown, increasing the amount of time locations in their path are exposed to dangerous conditions.

Between 1944 and 2017, 66 storms have stalled in the north Atlantic Basin, and nearly two-thirds of those occurred within the final 25 years of the study, suggesting a trend towards slower-moving storms, according to a 2019 study from Kossin and co-author Timothy Hall.

But the phenomenon isn’t just confined to the Atlantic Basin.

His 2018 study in the scientific journal Nature found that the forward speed of hurricanes decreased by 10% globally between 1949 and 2016, though there is some variation in different ocean basins.

The study also found a 20% to 30% slowdown over land areas affected by North Atlantic and North Pacific tropical cyclones, respectively.

The western north Pacific Basin, which sees the most storms annually, has also seen the most slowing, while storms in the northern Indian Ocean do not appear to be slowing down yet.

Overall, tropical cyclones have slowed more in the Northern Hemisphere, which is where a majority of storms occur each year.

There is considerable evidence that global summertime circulation patterns in the atmosphere are slowing as a result of global warming. Kossin believes this may also be putting the brakes on hurricane movement, but cautioned that the connection between climate and stalling is still unclear.

Some scientists think other variables may be at play.

Other natural climate variations — such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation – can also influence hurricane formation over long periods of time.

This study did not account for these natural cycles, which could be behind much of the observed trend, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.",
"Europe's vaccine rollout 'unacceptably slow,' WHO warns, amid 'worrying' surge","London (CNN) The rollout of vaccines in Europe is ""unacceptably slow,"" the World Health Organization said Wednesday, delivering a damning evaluation on the region's Covid response, amid a ""worrying"" surge in infections.

Many European nations have struggled to carry out effective vaccination programs as drug companies have repeatedly under-delivered on scheduled shipments. The region has vaccinated only 10% of its population with one shot in a two-dose regimen, WHO said in a statement.

""Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic. Not only do they work, they are also highly effective in preventing infection. However, the roll-out of these vaccines is unacceptably slow,"" WHO Regional Director for Europe Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge said in the statement.

""And as long as coverage remains low, we need to apply the same public health and social measures as we have in the past, to compensate for delayed schedules. Let me be clear: we must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now.""

Dorit Nitzan, regional emergency director for WHO Europe, warned that it was only five weeks ago that new cases in Europe had dipped to under 1 million, but now with more mobility, gatherings over religious holidays and the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant -- first identified in the UK -- pose a greater public risk. Last week there were 1.6 million new cases iin the region and almost 24,000 deaths.

Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"(CNN) — Ah, holiday travel . Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.

Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.

The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.

Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.

Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.

""No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,"" he says. ""These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.""

Keeping cabins calm

Flight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock

Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.

Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.

Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline.

Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.

""We are strongly against voice calls on planes,"" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: ""NO CELL PHONES.""

Flight attendants' opposition is significant.

They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.

On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.

Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.

""At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,"" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.

""If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.""

Passengers advocating for quiet

Most passengers don't want to listen to their fellow travelers talk on their cell phones. Shutterstock

Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.

Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an ""annoying"" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.

Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.

""I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,"" he says. ""It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.""

Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.

Business travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.

Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.

""For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,"" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. ""In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.""

One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.

This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.

Is the technology safe?

Newer planes are designed to not be affected by passengers' technology. Shutterstock

The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.

In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.

Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.

The rise of smartphones changed everything.

As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable.

Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.

Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.

Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.

""There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. ""But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.""

""The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,"" says Miller. ""There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.""

Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.

Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.

""Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,"" he says. ""When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.""

Regulatory, practical obstacles

Texting is already permitted on some airlines. Shutterstock

Though it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.

First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.

The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted.

""Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,"" he said.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance.

Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, ""The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.""

The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.

Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.

Who calls people anyway?

What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.

Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.

""When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,"" he says. ""On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.""

Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition.

"'Hamlet' in the skies? The story behind Taiwan's newest airline, STARLUX","(CNN) — Debuting its first flights in January 2020, Taiwanese start-up STARLUX Airlines could be the first new player in 30 years to upend the island's duopoly aviation market.

And even before the carrier, dubbed Taiwan's first luxury boutique airline, set its first aircraft into the air, it's been creating a stir.

Eleven minutes after opening ticket sales online on December 16, the Taipei-based carrier sold out all seats on its first three flights -- Taipei-Macau, Taipei-Penang and Taipei-Danang.

But both aviation watchers and the general public are abuzz for another reason: A succession drama involving STARLUX founder Chang Kuo-wei that's so juicy he's being referred to as the aviation industry's ""Prince Hamlet"" by local media.

This Shakepearean tale took root in 2016, when Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group and airline EVA Airways, passed away at the age of 88, sparking a battle over who would take over one of the island's biggest family-run conglomerates.

Chang, 49, who had been the chairman of EVA since 2013, revealed that his late father had named him the successor of parent company Evergreen in his will.

A well-loved figure in the aviation industry, known for his outspokenness and expertise, the son had experience working for EVA Airways as both an aircraft technician and a pilot.

But being the youngest son and the only child of Chang Yung-fa's second wife, Chang Kuo-wei's promotion ignited a family feud. He was soon ousted from EVA as chairman at a board meeting called by fellow family members.

A few months later, he announced that he was going to launch his own airline -- STARLUX Airlines.

""He doesn't think that he's 'Hamlet'""

Local media have called it a Hamlet-like retaliation plan.

The anticipation of the new airline's launch has grown as both EVA Airways and China Airlines, Taiwan's two main airlines, have been plagued by strikes and internal conflicts.

But according to the team at STARLUX, Chang isn't out for retribution.

""He doesn't think that he is 'Hamlet',"" K.W. Nieh, STARLUX's chief communication officer, tells CNN Travel. ""This has nothing to do with revenge.""

""Because of his passion for aviation, Chang merely wants to build an ideal airline that reflects his style after breaking from the shackles of Evergreen Group. He is building STARLUX to fulfill the expectations of his late father.""

CNN Travel has reached out to EVA Air for comment.

Whether or not Taipei-based STARLUX can outdo the other major players on the island remains to be seen, but it's certainly upped Taiwan's aviation game.

The airline is introducing a new generation of passenger aircraft, including the A321neo and A350-1000, ""both debuting for the first time in Taiwan,"" says Nieh.

Indeed, STARLUX is the first Taiwanese airline to be equipped with A321neos -- all 10 of them will be delivered by the end of 2021. STARLUX signed Taiwan's largest single Airbus purchase agreement, purchasing 17 A350XWB aircraft in March 2019.

Chang himself piloted STARLUX's first A321neo to Taipei from Hamburg last month.

""The fleet will grow to 27 aircraft by the end of 2024 and 50 by the end of 2030,"" adds Nieh.

The interior of the narrow body cabin, designed by BMW's Designworks studio, is fitted with sleek seats, leather headrests and inflight entertainment systems across all classes.

Economy class seats will feature a 10.1-inch 720p screen while business class seats -- equipped with narrow-body seats that can recline into an 82-inch fully flat bed -- will offer a 15.6-inch 1080p inflight entertainment system.

Free Wi-Fi with basic access (texting only for economy passengers) will be offered for both classes on all STARLUX flights -- also a first in Taiwan.

Local touches abound as well. A unique cabin scent -- with notes of woods, leather and florals -- has been created by Taiwan-grown fragrance brand P.Seven. The airline's crew uniform, which bears themes of retro-futuristic travel in the 40s and 50s, is the product of local designer Sean Yin.

No fare war: STARLUX will charge more than competitors

Aspiring to be the Emirates of Asia, STARLUX vows to provide premium service, too.

At a recent press event, Chang said STARLUX Airlines will not start a fare war. Instead, its tickets will be reasonable but more expensive than its competitors.

""We consider flying as an enjoyable part of the journey,"" adds Nieh. ""We offer top-notch and exquisite services. It differentiates STARLUX from other companies in the market.

""We position ourselves as a boutique airline, targeting the higher-end market. We have introduced the most advanced aircraft models with the latest aviation technology and seats. We offer exquisite service items so the fare will be slightly higher than the other airlines.""

According to aviation expert CK Law, senior adviser of the Department of Aviation Policy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this unique positioning is a clever move for STARLUX.

""Many new airlines have been tapping into the low-cost sector in the market, particularly in this part of the world,"" says Law.

""That's definitely the major trend. There should be reasonable demand for the high-end passenger segment of the market.""

But he expects the new airline will still have an impact on airfares in the long run.

""From the passengers' point of view, there will be new and substantial benefits for them to have new choices and possible new fare reductions in the longer term. There'll be competition for better services on the plane,"" says Law.

Potential cut-throat competition

Taiwan has been enjoying healthy passenger growth numbers as well as flights in recent years.

Boeing has estimated that Taiwan's aviation demand will be stronger than the Northeast Asia region's annual average -- 2% over the next two decades -- as a whole.

But is there enough space to accommodate another major airline?

""A new full-service airline would definitely introduce a lot of new competition to a traditional aviation market like Taiwan,"" says Law.

""Whether the new airline or even the existing airlines can survive because of this will mainly depend on how fast the market will grow and whether the new demand could absorb or balance with the new supply capacity.

""Otherwise, that could be a cut-throat competition and there could be casualties.""

One of the biggest questions is: Can a newcomer carve a spot for itself in the long-haul and transit markets, the two markets STARLUX plans to explore?

""I would expect a good, high load factor being achieved for the short haul tourism markets but the long haul destinations, which have [major competition in Taiwan,] would definitely be more challenging,"" says Law.

""It won't be easy for new airlines to join a reputable alliance, to start with. Without being a member of an alliance, it won't be easy at all to get transit passengers. But it can be a long-term goal,"" says Law.

Nieh, on the other hand, is confident.

""The development of STARLUX doesn't solely rely on the Taiwan market. Taipei has a superior geographical location -- you can reach major Asian cities within five hours"" he says.

""Located in a central position connecting North America, North Asia and Southeast Asia, Taiwan has the best foundation to develop as an aviation hub. By introducing and building its hardware and software, the aviation industry of Taiwan will hopefully become the transportation hub of Asia, strengthen its transit services and bring a large number of international passengers to Taiwan.""

Nieh points to a recent study by the Taiwan government's National Audit Office, which claims only 10% of the island's inbound travelers are transit passengers.

""Comparing to Hong Kong, Incheon, Shanghai and Tokyo, there is room for market development,"" says Nieh. ""We're very certain about this part.""

The initial rush for ticket sales has been good news for STARLUX.

""Tickets to Macau sold out in six minutes; tickets to Danang sold out in nine and tickets to Penang sold out in 11 minutes,"" Liwen Liu, director of STARLUX's corporate communications division tells CNN.

""All 188 seats on each of the three flights.

""We're very happy about it. We had our expectations but the response has been better than what we expected,"" says Liu.

'An arduous journey'

Grabbing a slice of the market isn't STARLUX's only worry.

Construction delays at the third terminal of Taoyuan Airport have forced the airline to build its check-in counters, airport office, maintenance hangar and apron spaces with very limited resources, says Nieh.",
Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,"Copenhagen (CNN) — In Copenhagen, traffic is usually caused by the two-wheel variety of transportation: the bicycle.

Ever since bicycles were imported into Denmark from France in 1869, they have become the main form of transportation in the Scandinavian city. In the 1920s, it wasn't unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro's new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around.

While Copenhagen's Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility.

In addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey.

Greater accessibility

Cityring, a 15.5-kilometer (approximately 9.63 miles) circular line with 17 new stops — which nearly doubles the number of existing stations — now connects outlying neighborhoods that radiate far from the city center. Residents won't need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen's hygge-inducing winters.

The impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. ""First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,"" he said. ""But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center.""

Courtesy The Copenhagen Metro

Public squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing.

""We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,"" said Olsen.

Building the line was not without its challenges.

Olsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people's daily lives. ""We had the machinery right outside people's windows for quite a substantial number of years,"" he said.

Technical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik's Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station.

Controlling groundwater was also imperative during construction.

""A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,"" explained Olsen, ""If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they'll rot.""

In addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system.

Shiny, new rails

The new M3 line allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company

The line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.

The system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).

Unlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing. For today's iTouch culture, screens by ticket machines supply riders with route information and maps.

Not just easy on the ride, Cityring's stations are easy on the eyes.

Glass and light are key design elements and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. At the Frederiksberg Allé station, for example, the green interior color scheme is a segue to the outdoor park that greets riders when they reach street level.

Cleanliness and efficiency are two tenets of the Metro system. Revenue generated from ticket sales is reinvested into maintenance, and quarterly surveys of passengers give Metro operators direction on what's working, what's not and where they need to direct funds.

Bike-friendly

The Cityring doesn't want to compete with bikes, but instead integrate itself into existing transportation infrastructure. ""Metro actually supports the thoughts of the having bikes being either last mile or first mile mode of transportation, so you could use it in combination,"" said Olsen.

Bikes are allowed on the Metro during non-rush hours, and cellars at every station provide storage for the two-wheeled vehicles when not in use. Screens at exit points announce nearby bus and train departures for easy connections.

This shiny new rail line is conductor-less and runs automatically. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company

While these features have residents excited about the new system, Olsen believes ""the most important thing is that you don't have to look up time table,"" he said. ""You can just go through the station and there'll be a train right after."" To him, freedom from the shackles of a schedule exemplifies the ease of using the Metro.

The new M3 line — and the expansion of the Metro in general — not only services the city internally, but allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Citing Hamburg, Germany, and Stockholm, Sweden as nearby rivals, Olsen hopes to attract both businesses and tourists to Copenhagen via opportunities presented by the Metro.

With the opening of the M3 Cityring, ridership is expected to rise from 65 million to 122 million by 2020, and two extensions to the existing M4 line are due to open over the next five year.

While projections are ambitious, Olsen's definition of success is more modest.",
Mystery Hotel Budapest: The hotel designed for likes,"(CNN) — One of the first things you'll notice on entering the Mystery Hotel Budapest is the Aladdin-style magic carpet ""floating"" above the reception desk.

This is the first indication there's much more to this boutique hotel than meets the eye.

Then there's the countless light boxes on the walls displaying animated pictures that change several times a day and the elevator, which is partially hidden by velvet curtains.

Depending on which room you're staying in, you could find yourself lying against a headboard with a version of Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" where the ""girl"" has an iPhone in her hand, or a ""party girl"" interpretation of Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" complete with VIP passes to Budapest's Sziget Festival.

And if you happen to book visit the ""secret"" Pythagoras meeting room, you'll have to figure out how to open it yourself (hint -- there's an unassuming box involved).

Located in Budapest's Terézváros district, the Mystery Hotel is arguably one of the most thrilling hotels in the city thanks to the intrigue that lies inside its walls.

It's set inside what was once the main headquarters of the Symbolic Grand Lodge of Hungarian Freemasons, providing the inspiration for its enigmatic theme, along with movies such as ""The Da Vinci Code.""

While it lacks the dramatic city views and central location of some of Budapest more famous hotels, the property, which opened in May 2019, is fast becoming one of the most Instagram-friendly places to stay in Budapest.

This is certainly no accident. In fact, the hotel's designer Zoltán Varró admits he had ""likes"" in mind when conceptualizing the property.

""Instagram has really changed the hotel industry,"" Varró tells CNN Travel. ""Around 20 years ago, people wanted to go to big names because they felt safe with them.

""Now the most important thing is to stand out. Everyone is looking for something special. Social media is vital.

""When a guest sees something amazing and takes a picture, it can be shared with the rest of the world in seconds.""

Viktória Berényi, director of business development at the Mystery Hotel, says social media has helped to bring in a large number of bookings.

""First impressions are everything,"" says Berényi. ""There's a lot of competition in Budapest. We had some difficulties with the engagement of people at first.

""But we've had lots of guests who come here because they saw the pictures on Instagram.""

One of the many intriguing areas of the hotel is the Great Hall, which serves as a dining area, a bar, as well as a lobby.

Varró decided to make it the building's main focus after seeing photographs displaying the significance of the room during the 1890s, when Hungarian Freemasons regularly congregated here.

Freemasonry past

The grand staircase is among the elements preserved from the old building. Courtesy Mystery Hotel Budapest

One of the most influential and well-known secret societies, Freemasonry was founded in the UK, but quickly spread to Europe and the rest of the world.

The secular movement models itself upon the fraternities of medieval stonemasons, who used secret words and symbols to recognize each others' legitimacy.

After the former Republic of Councils in Hungary and later the Interior Minister of Hungary, Mihály Dömötör, banned the activities of Freemasons in 1920, the building went on to serve as a military hospital.

It was also used by the Hungarian National Guard Association, before returning to Freemasonry use after World War II. But during the communism era it went on to house the Ministry of the Interior until the fall of the regime in 1989.

Needless to say, the building changed considerably during its many different incarnations and its Freemasonry elements were concealed.

""After communism, the room was destroyed,"" says Varró. ""The Freemason aspects were completely covered, as no one wanted to talk about this.

""I didn't want it [the Great Hall] to be hidden away. This is the heart of the building.""

Its vaulted ceiling, which has been completely restored, is decorated with beautiful motifs, while the walls are adorned with bright columns and light boxes.

Although the entire hotel is filled with chandeliers, the largest hangs directly over a marble chess board floor area in the Great Hall.

At the far end of the room, two iron spiral stairs lead up to the gallery, where a private dining area aimed at larger groups can be found.

Lit up by candles, the grand staircase is one of various elements preserved from the original building, which dates back to 1896, along with the main doors.

You can see elements of the facade of the old building and the new building alongside each other from the sixth floor.

Varró has preserved various motifs used in Masonic symbolism around the buildings, along with sculptures of a sphinx, a square and compass.

Even the paintings in the corridors are linked to Freemasonry, some are the work of Freemasons background, while others are by artists from countries with strong links to the secular movement.

However, Berényi stresses the Mystery Hotel represents far more than just Freemasonry, noting the organization, which has been blighted by conspiracy theories, may hold negative connotations for some.

""As much as we are proud of the history, we can't make everything about the Freemasons, as they represent different things to different people,"" she says.

Unique suites

There are three different suite styles, Doric, Ion and Corinthian. The Doric rooms, which overlook the hotel's courtyard and the Secret Garden Spa, hold English Victorian style features and are decorated in various shades of green.

The Ion rooms are based on the upper floors of the hotel and possess a French mansard style, while the Corinthian rooms hold Baroque style furnishings, such as burgundy velvet curtains.

Located on the sixth floor, the Atelier Suite is the most unique suite in the building. Designed to resemble a painter's studio, it holds a marble staircase, brick walls, huge paintings and dozens of rugs. Even the TV stand takes the form of an art easel.

""The original plan was to have this room as a storage area, because it only has two small windows,"" explains Varró.

""When I decided to make it one of the biggest suites, the owner thought I was crazy. But it's been very popular.""

The suite is often requested for private gatherings, with the likes of Italian luxury fashion house Dolce&Gabbana hiring it for private events.

While the Great Hall is a tough act to follow, not to mention rooftop bar the Sky Garden, which provides views of the Royal Palace, the hotel spa is another stand out spot.

There are plenty of beautiful thermal baths to choose from in Budapest, which means any hotel spa here has to be pretty impressive in order to entice visitors.

However, the Secret Garden Day Spa definitely doesn't disappoint.

Situated in the hotel's enclosed courtyard, it has a Baroque garden feel, with dramatic palm trees and a beautiful fountain.

Guests have the option to relax on day beds, slip into the sauna and steam room, or opt for some of the many cosmetic, body treatments and massages on offer.

The lighting in the spa is also fantastic due to its courtyard position, along with an array of crystal chandeliers.

""This was an empty place,"" says Varró. ""I wanted to create something different. I think this [the courtyard] is the perfect place for a spa. Budapest is not a very sunny city, but it's always summer here.""

Its center piece is undoubtedly the magnificent whirlpool, which provides a fantastic view of the facade of the building.

""We don't have thermal waters here, but we do have this,"" says Berényi. ""This Jacuzzi is very popular on Instagram.""",

How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with,"(CNN) — While Budapest may be primarily known for its architecture, geothermal springs and communist heritage, the city's gastronomy scene has been gaining considerable travel attention in recent years.

New and exciting fine dining spots are constantly opening up in the Hungarian capital, many headed up by prolific chefs keen to inject imagination and prestige into the Budapest dining experience.

Two restaurants in the Hungarian capital were awarded new Michelin stars in the past 12 months alone, bringing the total of Michelin-awarded establishments in Budapest to six.

Hungary only received its first Michelin star nine years ago, so this is a pretty remarkable turnaround.

There's little doubt a culinary revolution is underway in the ""Pearl of the Danube,"" but what's brought about this burgeoning movement?

Record numbers of tourists and a booming economy have definitely played a part.

With Hungary's difficult past well documented, it's fair to say that fine dining hasn't necessarily been a high priority for locals haunted by Communist austerity.

""Hungary was always a pretty poor country,"" explains Hungarian food critic Andras Jokuti. ""So the main goal of Hungarian cuisine was to stay alive. It was very important to have lots of proteins and carbs -- it was based around potato and meat.""

Culinary movement

Miguel Vieira at Budapest restaurant Costes tells CNN Travel what makes great, creative cuisine.

Shifting this perception has been a lengthy process, which continues today. However, the tide is definitely turning.

Portuguese chef Miguel Rocha Vieira believes this is partly due to good quality produce becoming more readily available in the country during the past decade.

""We'd have to buy butter from abroad [before] because there was no good quality butter here,"" he tells CNN.

""Everything is completely different now.""

Vieira heads up Costes, based in Raday Street, and was at the restaurant's helm when it became the first in the country to earn a Michelin star back in 2010.

He produces modern takes on classic Hungarian dishes, serving up four to seven-course set menus with various wine pairings.

Jokuti feels that Vieira injected life into the dining scene by merging both Hungarian and Portuguese influences into his dishes early on.

""When Miguel arrived in Budapest, it was like the very beginning of the fine dining story in Hungary,"" he says.

Vieira admits he knew little about Hungarian cuisine when he came to the country all those years ago and was often ""hammered by critics.""

""My cooking has changed a lot,"" he adds. ""Now I can tell you proudly that my stamp is in the food.""

""One of the biggest compliments we can have here is if somebody says, 'I felt this dinner had personality.""

While Vieira tries to incorporate Hungarian traditions in his dishes, this isn't the ""ultimate goal"" and he certainly doesn't have Michelin stars in mind while in the kitchen.

""I always say to the boys, 'We should cook for ourselves. We should do what we believe.' It's not about cooking for awards,"" he adds. ""It's not looking for stars or for recognition.

""That's the cherry on top of the cake. But that's not why we work 14, 15 or 16 hours a day.""

Modern interpretations

Chef Tamas Szell from Budapest restaurant Stand on his modern interpretations of traditional Hungarian dishes.

Hungarian chef Tamas Szell has been credited with putting Hungarian food on the map back in 2016, when his modern interpretations of the country's traditional dishes won him the gold medal at the prestigious 'Bocuse D'or Europe' competition.

Szell and co-chef Szabina Szulló head up the kitchen at Stand, which was awarded its first Michelin star this March, has a similar approach to cooking to Vieira.

""Food is the best communication between a chef and the guests,"" Szell tells CNN.

""Hopefully our dishes contain the sweet memories from childhood. When I cook a dish, it should be acceptable to both our grandmothers and a Michelin inspector. This is the most difficult [part] I think.""

Stand opened in Budapest in 2018 following the success of market hall bistro Stand25, which Szell and Szulló also ran together.

""My inspirations definitely come from my childhood,"" he adds. ""My mother had a saying, 'we are poor but we are living well'.""

Szell says his fisherman's soup, which contains carp, paprika, water and tiny ravioli type pasta known as deraya in Hungary, is the second most popular soup after goulash.

""When I was a child, my mother often made it this way,"" he explains.

Szell's dishes appear to be having the desired impact. Stand, based on Székely Mihály street, has been a big hit since it launched.

In fact, Jokuti describes it as the ""the perfect Hungarian restaurant,"" praising the inventive way Szell manages to tone down the richness of traditional Hungarian cuisine.

""This, I think, is his biggest achievement. To somehow recreate the traditions into something modern,"" says Jokuti.

Szell sources his dairy products from a tiny farm just outside Budapest, which supplies to a handful of fine dining restaurants in the city.

Within 48 hours of the milk leaving the cow's udder, it's being served up back at Stand in the form of cottage cheese,

""I think the ingredients are the most important thing,"" adds Szell. ""The good ingredients always try to find the chef and the chef always tries to find the best ingredients.""

Find out why Budapest restaurant Babel is a unique feature of the city's culinary scene.

Situated in Budapest's downtown, Babel is one of the most recent restaurants in the city to be awarded a Michelin star.

It's relatively small, with around a dozen tables, exposed brick walls and dim lighting, offering an intimate dining experience.

Inspired by Hungarian traditions and the Romanian region of Transylvania, chef Istvan Veres presents five to 10 course tasting menus containing simple ingredients such as nettle or lichen.

Veres says cooking is an ""obsession"" rather than a passion for him, describing how he'll often dream about a dish and then attempt to bring it to life the very next day.

""In fine dining, you have to do something special, something unique,"" he says.""You put your soul on the plate.""

""I'm never scared about new things.""

According to Jokuti, it's this fearlessness that makes Veres such a trailblazing chef.

""Istvan's taste is not that easy to follow,"" says Jokuti. ""I love to go to Babel because I'm always surprised.""

Basic ingredients

Salt is tipped to become the next Budapest restaurant to receive a Michelin star. Courtesy Salt Budapest

Hoping to repeat the success of Stand, Babel and Costes, is new dining establishment Salt, which has only been open since October.

It's run by chef Szilard Toth and manager Mate Boldizsar, who often serve up the dishes to diners themselves.

Toth regularly goes foraging for produce in the Hungarian countryside, coming back with all types of edible delights.

""We find so many basic ingredients that an average chef does not really see very often,"" Toth tells CNN.

""This means we can introduce a world of flavors for our food -- amazing flavor pairings that can't be found anywhere else.""

The chef's table is positioned in the middle of the restaurant, so diners can wander over to ask questions about the dishes, or just watch Toth and his team in action.

Dishes are presented simply -- some don't even require cutlery -- and customers can opt for a Hungarian wine pairing menu to complement their meal.

The team at Salt pride themselves on transforming basic produce into fine dining and the restaurant is filled with jars containing fermented or pickled items found in the forest.

""We have a course called greasy bread,"" says Boldizsar. "" In its original form, it's a very, very simple dish.

""Just a piece of bread with some fat. We put some bacon on it, some caviar and some lambskin.""

Only time will tell whether Salt will gain a coveted Michelin star, but the restaurant does seem to be winning over may diners in the short time it's been around for.

""I think he [Toth] shows that it's possible to create a very hedonistic, but still very modern meal from sometimes humble, but very Hungarian ingredients,"" says Jokuti.

A restaurant like Salt would have seemed inconceivable in the Hungarian capital a few years ago.

Its emergence is a clear indication of the adventurous direction the city's culinary scene is currently moving in.

""It's really fascinating to witness these times in Hungarian cuisine,"" says Jokuti.

Flame Towers: Luxury atop one of the world's tallest hotels,"Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.

(CNN) — From traditional souks, mosques and UNESCO World Heritage sites, to futuristic skyscrapers, Baku, capital of Azerbaijan , offers an eclectic mix of old and new.

Among the most startling additions to the modern skyline are the Flame Towers, a trio of sky-high structures that resemble tongues of fire reaching high over the Caspian Sea.

Designed by US architecture firm HOK, and with Tower 1 standing at 182 meters, they're the tallest buildings in Azerbaijan.

And visitors can stay in them -- one building's residential, one is for office use, while the third, the 165-meter-tall Fairmont Baku, is a contemporary five-star hotel.

Enter the flame

The towers can be seen from almost anywhere in the city, but night is when they truly come alive. Orange, red and pink LED lights dance across the towers like burning flames.

For some in Baku, they're now a symbol of home.

""You can see Flame Towers as you fly into the airport, lit up with multicolored lights and shining the way,"" fashion designer and media professional Nina Zandnia tells CNN Travel. ""They're the sign that lets everybody know they've reached Azerbaijan.""

So what's it like to stay in one of the country's most familiar landmarks? It's certainly no ordinary hotel.

The bold, sometimes bombastic statements begin with the dramatic exterior and keep going all the way inside.

The venue's seven-story lobby is dominated by an extravagant chandelier, using five kilometers of strands, decorated with 840 lights and more than 600,000 crystal beads, and weighing a whopping two metric tons.

Taking pride of place below is a limited edition black and red Fazioli, one of the most expensive pianos in the world. The M Liminal , designed by NYT Line and Philippe Gendre, was purportedly accompanied Nigar Jamal and Eldar Gasimov in the performance that took Azerbaijan to victory in the 2011 edition of the annual Eurovision song contest.

Guests shouldn't expect to hear it used in any casual jam sessions, it's now only played by top pianists on special occasions.

Sea views

The tower is home to more than 300 rooms, suites and serviced apartments, that range in price from $170 to upwards of $5,000 a night.

Even the most basic offer ceiling-to-floor windows and sumptuously large double beds. The décor is a contemporary luxury mix, with plush carpets and modern furniture. Spacious and comfortable, each room in the hotel either looks out over the city or across the bay into the sea.

Crisp and glamorous as it is, it does have an edge of corporate blandness that falls short of the regal vibes felt, for example, in the nearby Four Seasons.

A typical one-bedroom suite on the 17th floor offers views of the Caspian Sea and, if eligible, access to the Fairmont Gold lounge on the 19th floor, which comes with a private check-in area and concierge service.

The super-fast elevator to the 17th opens onto a spectacular landing with views across the bay. Once inside the suite, there's a lobby area, are more jaw-dropping views, an office-slash-dining room, with wooden desk and a four-seater dining table.

Then there's a generous, richly carpeted lounge with an oversized sofa and jazzy signature chair. The separate bedroom has a huge king-sized bed. There's an enormous walk-in closet stacked with hangers, drawers and laundry essentials that leads into a large bathroom complete with bath and shower room.

In both of the suite's two bathrooms, there are bespoke toiletries -- yes, your name is printed on the shampoo, moisturizer and conditioner bottle. It's a souvenir just asking to be taken home.

The royal suite

Nice touches, but does the hotel have celeb appeal? Yes, says, Zumrud Ismayilova, the hotel's PR and marketing manager. Names are not named, but the list apparently includes leaders, royals and celebrities.

""We have had many VIP guests stay at the hotel, but we would never disclose who they are,"" she tells CNN Travel. ""When our guests come to stay with us, they expect privacy and confidentiality and that is exactly what we give them.""

Positioned at the very tip of the flame, the Royal Suite offers panoramic views of both city and sea. There are two bedrooms, both with en suite bathrooms, a lounge, private dining room, study, a guest bathroom, a kitchen and a grand hallway with chandelier -- 375 square meters (4,036 square feet) of living space in total.

""The VIP or family will stay in the suite, but the rest of their party tends to take over the entire floor. We have additional rooms for security and staff, and a suite for extra family members,"" explains Ismayilova.

There's an open-plan living area, private study, a dining room fit for for 12 or more guests and a fully equipped kitchen (for the servants, of course). But the main attraction is the grand en suite bathroom with a vast oyster-shaped bath complete with window view over the bay.

Wellness

The hotels amenities are a mixed bag. There's an elegant spa spread over two floors of the hotel with indoor pool, sauna, hot tub, hammam and spaces to unwind. There's also a fully equipped gym.

The beautifully designed Sky Garden allows guests the luxury of relaxing on the sundeck or taking advantage of the poolside sauna while looking out at the sea. There's an S-shaped rooftop pool and outdoor bar, which look better from a distance than close up.

It's best visited come evening. When the sun's up, the towers reflect the sun and magnify its heat, making this area a frying pan.

Food and entertainment

As you'd hope from a fancy hotel inside one of the country's biggest landmarks, the main Le Bistro restaurant offers an array of local Azerbaijani wines and delicacies. The Balcon café offers specialty teas and cakes, as well as sushi in the afternoons.

There's also the Nur lounge which is a funky setting serving cocktails and snacks, and is a good pre-drinks site to soak in the atmosphere before moving onto the hotel's Jazz Club, a local institution.

""We always recommend people to check out the Jazz Club after 9 p.m., because that's when it really gets going. It's very popular with both the hotel guests and the locals, and we always offer something new to keep people entertained,"" Ismayilova says.

There are two things that most hotels are unable to provide -- a shopping mall and cinema. Fairmont Flame Towers offers both.

Park Cinema provides guests (and members of the public) with six screens, including IMAX, showing the latest Arabic, English and Russian language films.

Next door is the Flame Towers Shopping Mall, due for completion in early 2020. Luxury brands, high street names, cafes and restaurants are all set to take up residency.",
Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air,"(CNN) — There are a number of destinations around the world famed for the longevity of their residents.

There's one long-lived corner of the globe you won't have heard talked about as much, and it's home to the world's only Museum of Longevity. That's Lerik in southern Azerbaijan

The South Caucasus country is home to several regions known for producing residents who live to triple-figure ages, including Lankaran and Nagorno-Karabakh. But another, Lerik, is reputed to have the highest concentration of centenarians.

In this emerald land high above the clouds in the Talysh Mountains, reached by loop after loop of a serpentine road, people seem to have discovered a secret to a long and healthy life.

The Museum of Longevity

The two-room Museum of Longevity, built in 1991 and renovated in 2010, holds more than 2,000 exhibits documenting the lives and memories of the region's oldest inhabitants.

It charts individual lifespans with the household items that they've outlived, such as three generations of clothing irons. There are chests filled with headscarves and shirts, silver pitchers and bowls, beautifully knitted socks, and hand-dyed rugs that are still brightly colored despite their age.

And then there are the letters, written in both Azerbaijani and Russian -- personal artifacts so old that the ink is starting is fade.

Perhaps the most captivating features are the portraits of centenarians that cover the museum's walls. These images, dating from the 1930s, were donated by French photographer Frederic Lachop.

The museum, and official Azerbaijan statistics, define ""centenarian"" more loosely than you'd expect: Here, it means anyone over 90 years old.

However, back in 1991, there were more than 200 people in Lerik registered as being more than 100 years old, out of a population of 63,000.

Numbers have been less impressive since then, which locals blame variously on radiation from communication towers and environmental decline, but could just as easily be down to more rigorous record-keeping.

Today, there are 11 people more than 100 years old, out of a local population of 83,800.

The tale of the 168-year-old man

Is this the world's oldest man ever? Perhaps not. Kamilla Rzayeva

Lerik's current oldest citizen is Raji Ibrahimova, at 105 years. That's a fine vintage, but it pales in comparison to the age reputedly reached by area's most celebrated centenarian, Shirali Muslumov, a shepherd who supposedly lived to be 168.

The yellow pages of his passport claim that he was born in 1805 and his gravestone states that he died in 1973. If true, it would make the the oldest person to have ever lived.

Unfortunately, back in the early 19th century, birth registrations rarely took place in such remote villages as his birthplace of Barzavu, so there is no certifable record of when he was born.

Countless letters sent from all over the world on his various birthdays leave no doubt that he was indeed of a very respectable age, but it's perhaps best to factor in a minimum 20-year margin of error.

Among those corresponding with Muslumov were Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who sent a postcard greeting him with the endearment, ""Dear Grandpa.""

This longevity gene seems to run in the family. His 95-year-old daughter, Halima Qambarova, tells CNN Travel that -- while she might not live to 168, like her father -- she at least hopes to live to the age of 150, like her grandfather, or 130, like her aunt.

'Stillness of the mind'

When the weather turns cold, most centenarians relocate to the kinder coastal climes of Lankaran , but Qambarova was still in the Lerik village of Barzavu when CNN Travel dropped by her father's modest two-story home, surrounded by massive apple and pear trees (probably contemporaries of her famous father).

Sitting by the window, wrapped in a shawl, she speaks with a slight accent, switching often to her native language of Talysh, a dialect spoken by just 200,000 people and classified as ""vulnerable"" by UNESCO.

She shows off her passport, which doesn't list a month or date of birth, only the year: 1924. She may be 95, but she is fully present, interacting with her great-grandchildren, and demonstrating her lively sense of humor. When asked her age, she cheerfully replies, ""15.""

""Stillness of the mind is part of their secret,"" the museum guide says. ""They stay away from stress, thinking about life quite philosophically, living one day at a time, without much planning or worry for the future.""

Good nutrition and natural remedies

Halima Qanbarova is a young thing of 95. Her grandfather is said to have lived to 150, her father to 168, and her aunt to 130. Kamilla Rzayeva

Qambarova's day starts at dawn; she doesn't let herself sleep in. ""I get up as soon as my eyes open,"" she says.

She spends the whole day working in the garden or around the house. Her room is small, with a thick soft carpet and pillows on the floor. Many people here prefer sleeping on the ground, with just a thin blanket instead of a mattress, as it's believed to be the healthiest way to rest the back.

Contrary to popular belief, the centenarians of Lerik do eat meat, but they inherited a preference for fresh dairy products such as shor (cottage cheese), butter, milk and the yoghurt drink ayran from earlier centenarians, for whom the abstinence from meat was more due to economic circumstance.

Qambarova's daughter-in-law brings in a big plate with pears and apples from their garden and some aromatic tea.

It's herbal, floral and refreshing. Back at the museum, the guide shows a table with the various herbs native to Lerik.

""The secret of long life is good nutrition, the minerals in the spring water and the herbs that we add to tea to prevent illnesses, so people don't have to take any medicine, only using the natural remedies,"" says the guide. Indeed, Qambarova insists she's never taken any medication.

Generations living side by side

Beyond her windows, it may seem that the village is quiet and still. But the physical work that villagers put in every day is immense. From sunrise until sunset they work in gardens and fields as well as around the house. They sew and knit and take care of big families.

Such was the lifestyle of Mammadkhan Abbasov, a 103-year-old from Jangamiran village. Sitting on the carpet, across from the window, the centenarian has almost completely lost his sight and can barely hear his son telling him that guests have arrived, but when he finally catches it, he starts singing, offering prayers and good wishes.

At Abbasov's side is his great grandson -- a century gap between them.

Just like Qambarova, Abbasov has been a busy villager his whole life, working in the fields until about seven years ago, when his vision deteriorated.

'Whatever God gives'

Lerik is testament to the benefits of fresh mountain air. Kamilla Rzayeva

""He has always been a good man and lived his life properly,"" his son says.

In terms of food, he eats ""whatever God gives"" with just one restriction -- he never drinks alcohol.

Abbasov attributes his long life to daily physical activity, not to the point of exhaustion, but enough to challenge the body.

Along with the good nutrition from the farm products, he also used to drink liters of ice-cold spring water, which is rich with minerals said to contribute to longevity.

The headache-inducing altitudes of mountains may also be a factor.

2017 study by the University of Navarra, Spain , found that living at high elevation decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A 2011 study by the University of Colorado Denver found that these sky-high residents also live longer

The ages of some of these celebrated centenarians may still be disputed, but here in Lerik their legacy lives on through the people that still abide by the simple secret of Lerik's longevity: physical activity, good nutrition, lots of water and an attitude to life that says: We only live once, but if we do it right, once is enough.",
Eternal flame: How Azerbaijan became the 'Land of Fire',"Editor's Note — Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.

(CNN) — ""This fire has burned 4,000 years and never stopped,"" says Aliyeva Rahila. ""Even the rain coming here, snow, wind -- it never stops burning.""

Ahead, tall flames dance restlessly across a 10-meter stretch of hillside, making a hot day even hotter.

This is Yanar Dag -- meaning ""burning mountainside"" -- on Azerbaijan 's Absheron Peninsula, where Rahila works as a tour guide.

A side effect of the country's plentiful natural gas reserves, which sometimes leak to the surface, Yanar Dag is one of several spontaneously occurring fires to have fascinated and frightened travelers to Azerbaijan over the millennia.

Venetian explorer Marco Polo wrote of the mysterious phenomena when he passed through the country in the 13th century. Other Silk Road merchants brought news of the flames as they would trave l to other lands.

It's why the country earned the moniker the ""land of fire.""

Ancient religion

Such fires were once plentiful in Azerbaijan, but because they led to a reduction of gas pressure underground, interfering with commercial gas extraction, most have been snuffed out.

Yanar Dag is one of the few remaining examples, and perhaps the most impressive.

At one time they played a key role in the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which was founded in Iran and flourished in Azerbaijan in the first millennium BCE.

l e v a r t

For Zoroastrians, fire is a link between humans and the supernatural world, and a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom can be gained. It's purifying, life-sustaining and a vital part of worship.

Today, most visitors who arrive at the no-frills Yanar Dag visitors' center come for the spectacle rather than religious fulfillment.

The experience is most impressive at night, or in winter. When snow falls, the flakes dissolve in the air without ever touching the ground, says Rahila.

Despite the claimed antiquity of the Yanar Dag flames -- some argue that this particular fire may only have been ignited in the 1950s -- it's a long 30-minute drive north from the center of Baku just to see it. The center offers only a small cafe and there's not much else in the area.

Ateshgah Fire Temple

For a deeper insight into Azerbaijan's history of fire worship, visitors should head east of Baku to Ateshgah Fire Temple.

""Since ancient times, they think that [their] god is here,"" says our guide, as we enter the pentagonal complex which was built in the 17th and 18th century by Indian settlers in Baku.

Fire rituals at this site date back to the 10th century or earlier. The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for ""home of fire"" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent.

A natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku's main gas supply and is only lit for visitors.

The temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it's as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented.

Merchants and ascetics

Built like a caravanserai-style travelers' inn, the complex has a walled courtyard surrounded by 24 cells and rooms.

These were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end.

The temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold.",

Ataque al Capitolio genera nuevas preguntas sobre su seguridad (Análisis),"¿Hubo fallas de seguridad en incidente en el Capitolio? 0:53

(CNN) — La alerta de otro ataque en las cercanías del Capitolio de EE.UU. sacudió a todo Washington el viernes, rompió la sensación de relativa calma al comienzo del fin de semana festivo y recordó a todos que una nación que recién comienza a salir de la oscuridad de la pandemia todavía sigue amenazada casi tres meses después de la insurrección del 6 de enero.

En las semanas transcurridas desde que el expresidente Donald Trump dejó el cargo y el presidente Joe Biden asumió el mando, la sede del gobierno había comenzado a adquirir un tono de rápida eficiencia. El proceso de vacunación contra el covid-19 se aceleró a un ritmo cada vez mayor. La legislación de rescate económico por el coronavirus se apresuró a aprobarse en el Congreso, aunque con la aprobación de la línea del partido. Una sensación de normalidad había regresado al Capitolio después de cuatro años en los que el expresidente sembró el caos y la agitación constante y, en última instancia, fomentó un levantamiento.

El ataque del viernes dejó en claro que el Capitolio y sus ocupantes siguen siendo un objetivo vulnerable, incluso cuando los recuerdos de la violencia política del 6 de enero comenzaban a desvanecerse y Trump y sus aliados han intentado encubrir los peligros de ese día, incluso con el expresidente yendo tan lejos como para sugerir falsamente que los insurgentes estaban «abrazando y besando» a los agentes de policía y representaban «cero amenazas».

Aún se desconoce mucho sobre los motivos del sospechoso, identificado por fuentes policiales federales y locales como Noah Green, quien estrelló su vehículo contra la barricada norte del Capitolio poco después de la 1.00 p.m. (hora de Miami), golpeando a dos agentes de policía del Capitolio de EE.UU., salió de su automóvil y se dirigió hacia los policías con un cuchillo antes de que los agentes dispararan. Una fuente federal le dijo a CNN que el hombre tenía 25 años.

Las publicaciones en las cuentas de redes sociales de Green sugieren que luchaba con una enfermedad mental, que incluía paranoia y delirio, ya que escribió sobre el sufrimiento de «múltiples allanamientos en el hogar, intoxicaciones alimentarias, asaltos, operaciones no autorizadas en el hospital, control mental». Green, un aparente admirador del ministro Louis Farrakhan, líder de la Nación del Islam, publicó un video con una descripción que decía que «¡el gobierno de Estados Unidos es el enemigo número uno de los negros!» y atribuyó sus «terribles aflicciones» a fuerzas que presumía eran parte de «la CIA y el FBI, agencias gubernamentales de Estados Unidos”.

No obstante, cuando el agente de policía del Capitolio William «Billy» Evans, un veterano de 18 años de la fuerza, perdió la vida en el ataque y otro agente resultó herido el viernes, quedó claro que los miembros del Congreso aún no han logrado encontrar el equilibrio entre preservar la accesibilidad del edificio del Capitolio y garantizar la seguridad de los hombres y mujeres que lo protegen.

Solo han pasado semanas desde que se removió la cerca temporal de alambre de púas erigida alrededor del Capitolio. Pero la violación del Capitolio en enero ha creado la percepción de que el edificio aún es vulnerable a ataques, y las propuestas para asegurarlo están atrapadas en luchas internas partidistas.

Las autoridades dijeron durante una conferencia de prensa que no creen que el ataque del viernes esté relacionado con terrorismo. Y cuando se les preguntó si el sospechoso parecía apuntar a algún miembro, las autoridades dijeron que Green, quien no había sido identificado en ese momento, no era conocido por la Policía del Capitolio. Pero eso puede ser poco para consolar a los muchos asistentes y miembros del Congreso que temieron por sus vidas el 6 de enero y aún se sienten inseguros yendo a trabajar.

«Cuando fui elegido para el Congreso nunca pensé que venir a trabajar sería peligroso. Sinceramente, se ha convertido en un lugar peligroso. Cuando sales y vuelves a entrar, estás en guardia, mirando, preguntándote qué está pasando», dijo el representante de California Ro Khanna, un demócrata que estuvo en el Capitolio el viernes, a Wolf Blitzer de CNN en» The Situation Room».

«Creo que probablemente tendrán que repensar el perímetro y la seguridad de todo el complejo –la Corte Suprema, la Biblioteca del Congreso, el Capitolio– realmente pensar cómo pueden mantenerlo seguro y permitir que los estadounidenses sigan visitando», añadió el demócrata de California.

Biden, que había dejado la Casa Blanca para pasar el fin de semana de Pascua en Camp David en el momento del incidente, aludió en un comunicado a los duros meses que ha soportado la policía del Capitolio. El presidente dijo que él y su esposa Jill estaban desconsolados al enterarse del ataque que mató a Evans y «dejó a un compañero luchando por su vida». El segundo agente se encuentra ahora en condición estable.

«Sabemos lo difícil que ha sido este momento para el Capitolio, para todos los que trabajan allí y para quienes lo protegen», dijo Biden. «Quiero expresar la gratitud de la nación a la Policía del Capitolio, la Fuerza de Respuesta Inmediata de la Guardia Nacional y otros que respondieron rápidamente a este ataque. Mientras lamentamos la pérdida de otro valiente agente de la Policía del Capitolio, he ordenado que las banderas de la Casa Blanca estén a media asta».

El Congreso debate las recomendaciones de seguridad del Capitolio

En el entorno hiperpolitizado que rodeó los ataques del 6 de enero y el papel de Trump en incitar a sus partidarios a la violencia, la cuestión de la seguridad en el Capitolio ha generado un acalorado debate en el Congreso en las últimas semanas, en el que muchos miembros de ambos partidos exigen una justificación más clara para la cerca temporal con alambre de púas, mientras que algunos aliados incondicionales de Trump en el Congreso han intentado minimizar los peligros a los que se enfrentó la policía en los disturbios de enero.

Aunque el sospechoso del incidente del viernes no pudo atravesar la barricada y las tropas de la Guardia Nacional llegaron de inmediato para servir como respaldo, la muerte de Evans generó nuevas preguntas sobre los riesgos continuos para los agentes de la Policía del Capitolio de primera línea.

Después de realizar una revisión de seguridad de seis semanas en el Capitolio a pedido de la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, el teniente general retirado Russel Honoré y otros miembros del grupo de trabajo que encabezó instaron al Congreso a incrementar la dotación de personal de la Policía del Capitolio y mejorar la recopilación de inteligencia de la fuerza y sus capacidades, crear cercas móviles y mejorar la protección de los miembros del Congreso, entre otras mejoras.

Señalaron en su informe que la naturaleza de las amenazas contra el Capitolio y los miembros del Congreso ha cambiado y proviene cada vez más de elementos internos. La Policía del Capitolio, concluyó el informe del grupo de trabajo, «no está preparada para rastrear, evaluar, planificar o responder a esta plétora de amenazas debido a importantes déficits de capacidad, capacitación inadecuada, procesos inmaduros y una cultura operativa que no es impulsada por inteligencia”. Dijeron que la Policía del Capitolio no tenía «suficiente personal, ni el equipo necesario ni la capacitación adecuada» para manejar a la turba que atacó el edificio el 6 de enero.

El Inspector General de la Policía del Capitolio de Estados Unidos también criticó las fallas de inteligencia y la falta de planificación dentro del departamento antes del ataque de enero en un informe preliminar sobre el incidente, según una fuente familiarizada con el informe.

Pero los republicanos del Congreso se habían opuesto a lo que consideraban una falta de aportación bipartidista al grupo de trabajo formal designado por Pelosi y una falta de claridad para justificar algunas de las recomendaciones, como la necesidad de ampliar la Guardia Nacional.

Algunos miembros del Partido Republicano como el representante de California Darrell Issa criticaron el costo de los cambios propuestos, incluida la contratación de más de 850 personas para llenar no solo las 233 vacantes de la Policía del Capitolio, sino también nuevos puestos, incluidos especialistas en inteligencia, planificadores operativos y personal de la Unidad de Disturbios Civiles y agentes de protección de funcionarios.

Issa dijo que las propuestas equivalían a «muchas solicitudes de dinero», pero «no es un plan realmente completo».

Después del ataque del viernes, Honoré instó a los miembros del Congreso a tomar más en serio las amenazas emergentes y proporcionar fondos para aumentar el pie de fuerza, fortalecer el edificio y mejorar la capacitación para proteger a los agentes, miembros del Congreso y su personal.

«El Capitolio es un objetivo. Tenemos que adaptarnos a eso», le dijo Honoré a Blitzer en «The Situation Room».

Señaló, por ejemplo, que después del ataque del 6 de enero «mucha gente quería enviar a toda la Guardia Nacional a casa», pero los altos mandos de la Cámara mantuvieron una fuerza de respuesta más pequeña en su puesto en el Capitolio, lo que les permitió responder rápidamente el viernes. Honoré también señaló que la barricada que Green golpeó con su automóvil fue efectiva para detener una mayor incursión en el perímetro del Capitolio y elogió la rápida respuesta de la Policía del Capitolio y la Guardia Nacional.

«Infortunadamente, perdimos al agente Evans hoy, pero en general, ese sistema funcionó. La policía del Capitolio respondió. Detuvieron (al sospechoso)», dijo.

Y cuando Honoré presionó al Congreso para que proporcionara más fondos, agregó: «Nuestro Capitolio debe estar protegido. Debemos darles a los hombres y mujeres de la Policía del Capitolio lo que necesitan para hacer el trabajo».",2021-04-03 00:00:00

Todos los visitantes que ingresan al Capitolio deben ser examinados con un magnetómetro, mientras sus pertenencias ser revisan en una máquina de rayos X.

El edificio del Capitolio

El edificio del Capitolio cuenta con más de 540 salas y 658 ventanas.

La cúpula, construida entre 1855 y 1866, tiene más de 4.000 toneladas de hierro fundido y 108 ventanas. La figura en la cima del domo es la Estatua de la Libertad.

La Rotonda tiene una altura de 54,86 metros y un diámetro de 29,2 metros. En este espacio se exhiben pinturas y esculturas que retratan a personas y acontecimientos significativos de la historia de Estados Unidos. También reposan en esta sala los presidentes y ciudadanos distinguidos.

El Salón Nacional de las Estatuas solía albergar el despacho de la Cámara de Representantes, llamada Old Hall of the House (1809-1857). El salón alberga 100 estatuas de la colección que tiene el Capitolio de figuras de ciudadanos destacados en la historia de EE.UU., dos por estado.

Los Corredores Brumidi llevan el nombre del artista que diseñó los murales que los adornan, Constantino Brumidi.

Las zonas de visita en la planta baja incluyen la Sala de las Columnas, los Corredores Brumidi, la Antigua Cámara de la Corte Suprema y la Cripta (aquí se presentan exposiciones históricas).

Las cámaras del Senado están ahora en el ala norte. Mientras, los despachos de la Cámara de Representantes y las oficinas de los líderes del Congreso se encuentran en el ala sur.

El tercer piso cuenta con áreas para visitantes desde las que se pueden observar procedimientos del Congreso.

El Complejo del Capitolio incluye el Capitolio en sí, el Centro de Visitantes del Capitolio, los edificios de oficinas del Senado, los edificios de oficinas de la Cámara de Representantes, la Corte Suprema, la Biblioteca del Congreso, el Jardín Botánico de Estados Unidos y los terrenos del campus del Capitolio.

El mantenimiento del Complejo del Capitolio está a cargo del Arquitecto del Capitolio (AOC, por sus siglas en inglés).

El primer AOC fue el Dr. William Thornton en 1793.

"Arrodillarse sobre George Floyd era totalmente innecesario, dice detective","Testigo del arresto de Floyd: Un hombre estaba siendo asesinado 4:02

(CNN) — El principal detective de homicidios del Departamento de Policía de Minneapolis testificó que arrodillarse sobre el cuello de George Floyd luego de que hubiera sido esposado era «totalmente innecesario». «Si tu rodilla está sobre el cuello de alguien, eso podría matarlo», declaró.

El teniente Richard Zimmerman, jefe de la división de homicidios durante más de 12 años, testificó el viernes que Derek Chauvin violó las normas al presionar su peso sobre el cuello de Floyd durante más de nueve minutos mientras el hombre estaba esposado y en posición boca abajo. A los policías no se los entrena para arrodillarse sobre el cuello de una persona, dijo.

«Una vez que la persona está esposada, el nivel de amenaza baja por completo», dijo el teniente al jurado en el juicio a Chauvin por homicidio.

«¿Cómo puede lastimarte esa persona?» preguntó, y agregó que «que te lastimen es muy poco probable». Mantener a la persona esposada y en posición boca abajo «restringe su respiración», dijo.

Cuando el fiscal Matthew Frank le preguntó si alguna vez fue entrenado para arrodillarse sobre una persona, Zimmerman dijo que no.

«Porque si tu rodilla está sobre el cuello de alguien, eso podría matarlo», dijo el teniente.

publicidad

En ese momento, Chauvin levantó la cabeza en la mesa de la defensa y le lanzó una mirada a Zimmerman.

Este testimonio potencialmente devastador del funcionario de mayor rango del departamento tuvo lugar durante el quinto día del juicio, que fue más corto que los anteriores. El juez Peter Cahill mandó a los miembros del jurado a sus casas más temprano porque el juicio se adelantó a lo programado. El testimonio se reanudará el lunes.

Zimmerman dijo que las acciones de Chauvin fueron «injustificadas» y «totalmente innecesarias».

«Tienes que hacer que no queden sobre su pecho», dijo el investigador veterano en un punto. «Si estás acostado sobre tu pecho, eso te restringe aún más la respiración», explicó.

Zimmerman firmó el año pasado una carta abierta en la que agentes de Minneapolis condenaban a Chauvin tras lo sucedido.

En el interrogatorio, Zimmerman estuvo de acuerdo en que una persona inconsciente puede volverse combativa cuando se la reanima, dando patadas y revolcándose.

El abogado defensor Eric Nelson trató de demostrar que el trabajo policial ha cambiado significativamente desde que Zimmerman recibió su entrenamiento. Además intentó llamar la atención sobre la experiencia limitada de Zimmerman en el uso de la fuerza como investigador en comparación con la de un agente de patrulla.

Si bien no se los entrena para que pongan su rodilla sobre el cuello de un sospechoso, Zimmerman dijo a Nelson que, en una lucha por su vida, los agentes están autorizados a utilizar cualquier fuerza que sea razonable y necesaria.

Sargento describe la llegada a la escena de un «posible incidente crítico»

Más temprano, los miembros del jurado escucharon el testimonio del sargento que aseguró la zona poco después de que Chauvin se arrodillara sobre el cuello de Floyd.

El sargento Jon Edwards, un veterano de la policía con 14 años de experiencia, dijo que llegó al lugar de un «posible incidente crítico» un poco después de las 9:30 p.m. e hizo que otros oficiales rastrearan la zona en busca de posibles testigos.

En el lugar, Edwards le pidió a los agentes J. Alexander Kueng y Thomas Lane que activaran sus cámaras corporales, según dijo. Ambos agentes fueron acusados de complicidad en un homicidio intencional sin premeditación y de complicidad en un homicidio involuntario.

Zimmerman llegó a la escena en la Avenida Chicago poco antes de que, a las 10 p.m., Kueng y Lane fueran trasladados al Ayuntamiento como parte de una investigación de un incidente crítico, según Edwards.

El jueves, los integrantes del jurado escucharon la perspectiva de Chauvin en los minutos posteriores a que se llevaran el cuerpo inerte de Floyd en una ambulancia. Fue la segunda vez que escucharon su opinión sobre los que sucedió ese día. Un video de la cámara corporal de Chauvin que los jurados vieron el miércoles mostró cómo el exagente defendía sus acciones ante un transeúnte.

En una cámara corporal también quedó registrada una llamada que hizo Chauvin al sargento David Pleoger, su supervisor en ese momento. El video se reprodujo durante el testimonio de Pleoger el jueves. Chauvin lo llamó poco después de arrodillarse sobre el cuello de George Floyd durante más de nueve minutos el 25 de mayo para explicar su versión de lo que había sucedido.

«Solo iba a llamar para que vinieras a nuestra escena aquí», le dijo Chauvin a Ploeger. «Tuvimos que sujetar a un tipo. Se estaba volviendo loco. No quería… no quería entrar en la parte trasera de la patrulla…», agregó.

Luego el video se termina, pero en el resto de la llamada Chauvin dijo que George Floyd tuvo una emergencia médica después de luchar con los agentes que intentaban meterlo en un automóvil, según Pleoger. Chauvin no mencionó que había puesto su rodilla sobre el cuello y la espalda de Floyd, dijo Pleoger.

Pleoger condujo hasta el lugar y pidió a los agentes que hablaran con los testigos. «Podemos intentarlo, pero todos están bastante hostiles», respondió Chauvin.

Testigos dicen sentirse culpables por la muerte de Floyd 3:06

Esa misma noche más tarde, en el Centro Médico del Condado de Hennepin, Chauvin le dijo a su supervisor que se había arrodillado sobre el cuello de Floyd, relató Pleoger al jurado.

El video de la cámara corporal de Chauvin que se reprodujo frente al jurado el miércoles también mostró cómo defendió sus acciones ante un transeúnte que lo enfrentó por cómo había tratado a George Floyd.

«Esa es la opinión de una persona», respondió Chauvin mientras subía a su patrulla de policía. «Tuvimos que controlar a este tipo porque es un hombre grande. Parece que probablemente esté en algo», añadió.

Su versión del encuentro se contradice con los videos que muestran a Chauvin arrodillado sobre Floyd, quien había sido esposado después de desmayarse. Los fiscales dijeron que se arrodilló sobre Floyd durante 3 minutos y 51 segundos durante los cuales Floyd no respondía.

Chauvin se declaró inocente de los cargos de homicidio intencional sin premeditación, de homicidio involuntario y homicidio involuntario agravado en un acto eminentemente peligroso para otros. El acusado ha permanecido sentado en la mesa de la defensa tomando notas en un bloc de notas grande.

El jueves más temprano, la novia de George Floyd habló sobre la lucha de Floyd contra la adicción a los opioides, y dos paramédicos testificaron que Floyd parecía muerto cuando llegaron al lugar.

Supervisor de Chauvin dijo que debió haber dejado de usar la fuerza antes

El testimonio de Pleoger se centró en los protocolos policiales para el uso de la fuerza. Los agentes pueden usar la fuerza en ciertas circunstancias, pero deben detener el uso de la fuerza una vez que la persona está bajo control.

Pleoger testificó que su revisión de las imágenes de la cámara corporal mostró que Chauvin debió de haber dejado de usar la fuerza antes.

«Cuando el señor Floyd ya no ofrecía ninguna resistencia a los agentes, podrían haber puesto fin a la restricción», dijo. «Sería razonable poner una rodilla sobre el cuello de alguien hasta que no se resista más, pero debería detenerse cuando ya no fuera combativo», explicó.

El supervisor dijo que los agentes deben llamar a una ambulancia y prestar ayuda de emergencia mientras esperan que llegue. Las personas inmovilizadas deben ser puestas de lado para ayudarles a respirar.

En el contrainterrogatorio, Pleoger dijo que no había realizado una revisión formal del uso de la fuerza porque la investigación de la muerte ascendió en la cadena de mando.

‘Pensé que estaba muerto’, dice paramédico que atendió a George Floyd

Dos paramédicos del condado de Hennepin dijeron que, cuando llegaron al lugar, Floyd no respondía, no respiraba y no tenía pulso.

«En términos sencillos, pensé que estaba muerto», dijo el paramédico Derek Smith.

A Smith y su compañero Seth Bravinder los llamaron por un Código 2, que no es de emergencia, por una lesión en la boca. Sin embargo, aproximadamente un minuto y medio después la llamada se actualizó a un Código 3, lo que significa encender las luces y sirenas de la ambulancia.

Floyd no parecía estar respirando ni moviéndose. Smith comprobó el pulso y las pupilas de Floyd mientras Chauvin mantenía su rodilla sobre él. El paramédico dijo que creía que su corazón se había detenido. Bravinder le indicó a Chauvin que levantara la rodilla de Floyd para subirlo a una camilla y llevarlo a la ambulancia.

Bravinder dijo que estaban preocupados por la multitud de transeúntes.

Un agente subió a la ambulancia y ayudó con las compresiones en el pecho. Smith le quitó las esposas a Floyd, según testificó. Bravinder declaró que en un momento detuvo la ambulancia para ayudar a atender a Floyd.

Dentro de la ambulancia, no obstante, el corazón de Floyd no mostraba actividad. Intentaron reanimar su corazón con compresiones torácicas, estableciendo una vía aérea y con descargas eléctricas, pero no se recuperó. Luego lo dejaron en el hospital.

El capitán del Departamento de Bomberos Jeremy Norton testificó que nadie encontró pulso en el cuerpo de Floyd. Más tarde denunció el incidente a los superiores del Departamento de Bomberos porque se trataba de la muerte de alguien bajo custodia policial y un bombero fuera de servicio fue testigo.

George Floyd y su novia luchaban contra una adicción a los opioides

Courteney Ross, de 45 años, le dijo al jurado que conoció a Floyd en agosto de 2017. Entonces él trabajaba como guardia de seguridad en el Ejército de Salvación.

Floyd hacía ejercicio todos los días y nunca se quejaba de que le faltara el aire, dijo. Era un niño de mamá que se había convertido en una «sombra de sí mismo» tras la muerte de su madre en 2018, contó.

Ambos luchaban contra una adicción a los opioides, testificó. Les recetaron analgésicos opiáceos para tratar dolores crónicos, lo que finalmente dio lugar a una adicción y al consumo de drogas ilegales, testificó su novia.

En marzo de 2020, encontró a George Floyd doblado de dolor y lo llevó a una emergencia, declaró. Floyd pasó en el hospital varios días por una sobredosis, dijo. Cree que había vuelto a consumir de nuevo en mayo de 2020.

En las declaraciones de apertura, los fiscales reconocieron el historial de adicción a los opioides de Floyd, pero dijeron que era irrelevante para la causa de su muerte en mayor pasado. Sin embargo, el abogado defensor Eric Nelson ha argumentado que la verdadera causa de muerte de Floyd fue el consumo de drogas y varios problemas de salud preexistentes.

CDC: Las personas completamente vacunadas pueden viajar,"El papa Francisco ofrece vacunas para pobres y marginados 0:54

(CNN) — Los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE UU. publicaron el viernes una actualización muy esperada de la guía de viaje para las personas que están completamente vacunadas contra el covid-19, eliminando algunas recomendaciones de pruebas y cuarentena.



El CDC dice que las personas completamente vacunadas pueden viajar con poco riesgo para ellos mismos.

La agencia dijo que mientras se tomen precauciones contra el coronavirus, incluido el uso de mascarillas, las personas completamente vacunadas pueden viajar dentro de Estados Unidos sin hacerse la prueba de covid-19 antes o ponerse en cuarentena después.

Para viajes internacionales, las personas completamente vacunadas no necesitan una prueba de covid-19 antes de viajar, a menos que el destino lo requiera, y no necesitan ponerse en cuarentena después de regresar a Estados Unidos. Aún deben tener una prueba covid-19 negativa antes de abordar un vuelo a EE.UU. y una prueba de seguimiento de tres a cinco días después de su regreso, anotaron los CDC.

Los CDC considera a alguien completamente vacunado dos semanas después de recibir la última dosis requerida de la vacuna covid-19. La guía actualizada no se aplica a personas no vacunadas. Los CDC aconseja a cualquier persona que no esté completamente vacunada que continúe evitando viajar.

publicidad

Las personas no vacunadas que deben viajar deben hacerse la prueba de uno a tres días antes del viaje y nuevamente de tres a cinco días después del viaje. Deben ponerse en cuarentena en casa durante siete días después del viaje, o 10 días, si no se hacen la prueba después del viaje.

MIRA: Algunos países quieren establecer un «pasaporte covid» para las personas vacunadas contra el covid-19. Estas son sus propuestas

Los CDC dijeron que todos los estadounidenses, independientemente del estado de vacunación, deben usar una máscara y practicar medidas de salud pública cuando viajen, como el distanciamiento físico y lavarse las manos con frecuencia.

«Con millones de estadounidenses que se vacunan todos los días, es importante actualizar al público sobre la ciencia más reciente sobre lo que las personas completamente vacunadas pueden hacer de manera segura, que ahora incluye orientación sobre viajes seguros», dijo la directora de los CDC, la Dra. Rochelle Walensky, en un comunicado.

«Continuamos alentando a todos los estadounidenses a que se vacunen tan pronto como sea su turno, para que podamos comenzar a dar pasos seguros hacia nuestra vida cotidiana. Las vacunas pueden ayudarnos a volver a las cosas que amamos de la vida, por lo que alentamos a todos los estadounidenses a vacunarse tan pronto como tengan la oportunidad».

MIRA: ¿Cuáles son los destinos para viajeros vacunados contra el covid-19?

El mes pasado, los CDC publicaron su primera versión de orientación para estadounidenses completamente vacunados, en la que la agencia dijo que deberían evitar viajar.

Algunos críticos en ese momento dijeron que la postura de los CDC sobre los viajes para personas completamente vacunadas era demasiado rígida.

Walensky defendió la guía de viaje inicial de la agencia en ese momento, y explicó que los cambios en la guía continuarían a medida que más personas se vacunen en los EE. UU. Y que los datos científicos informarían cualquier recomendación.

«Estamos muy preocupados por las variantes transmisibles. Muchas de ellas han pasado por nuestros corredores de viaje, por lo que estamos siendo más cautelosos en este momento con los viajes», dijo Walensky a Anderson Cooper de CNN en marzo. Señaló que cada vez que aumenta el viaje, se produce un aumento en los casos de coronavirus, citando el Día de la Independencia, el Día del Trabajo y la temporada navideña.

Los expertos dicen que Estados Unidos parece estar entrando en otra nueva oleada esta primavera, que se debe en parte a más viajes. Estados Unidos promedió 63.974 casos diarios durante los últimos 7 días, un 11% más que la semana pasada.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Martín Guzmán: Apuntamos a una reducción de la inflación,"(CNN Español) — En un extenso reportaje en la primera edición de Conecta2 en CNN en Español, con la conducción de María O’Donnell y Ernesto Tenembaum, el ministro de Economía de Argentina Martín Guzmán destacó: “Apuntamos a una reducción gradual consistente de la inflación”.

Además, el funcionario respondió sobre negociación con el Fondo, las declaraciones de Cristina Fernández de Kirchner sobre la imposibilidad de pagar esa deuda y más. Estos son algunos apartes del intenso contrapunto.

Luego de la gira por Estados Unidos para renegociar la deuda y en vistas de su viaje a París, ¿cuál es el estado actual de la renegociación con el Fondo y con el Club de París?

“Lo de Europa también tiene que ver con las negociaciones con el Fondo Monetario Internacional, además del Club de París. Esto justamente tiene que ver con cómo funciona un proceso de negociación de un país con el resto del mundo, que es lo que el FMI es, en el cual se necesita poder alcanzar distintos tipos de consensos. Por supuesto, consensos internos: nosotros como país, como Estado nación, ponernos de acuerdo en ciertos pilares que son aquellos en los que se deben basar las políticas económicas para tener una economía más estable, con más oportunidades, resolviendo los problemas estructurales que por tantos años hemos padecido. Y también consensos internacionales: que el mundo, sobre todo los países que más influencia tienen en la toma de decisiones −los países del G7, del G20− apoyen la visión que el gobierno argentino está poniendo sobre la mesa para resolver sus problemas. Y en ese contexto poder refinanciar aquellas deudas que se tomaron entre 2018 y 2019 que son de un monto tal y con unos plazos tales que hoy el país no tiene capacidad de hacer frente y por eso hay que refinanciarlas”.

El día que usted estaba reunido con Georgieva del FMI, la vicepresidenta Cristina Fernández de Kirchner reclamó un “gesto” al Fondo Monetario sobre los plazos insuficientes.

“Fíjate la naturaleza del problema que se presenta. El Fondo Monetario Internacional prestó a la Argentina US$ 45.000 millones. Eso fue lo que se desembolsó de un préstamo de US$ 57.000 millones. En poco tiempo. Un monto que es récord histórico, equivalente a lo que se desembolsó este año para todos los demás países en 2020 en el contexto de la pandemia. Es tan grande el monto, que desde el punto de vista de la sostenibilidad macroeconómica, de la capacidad de pago del país, se pone en tensión con lo que son los programas estándares del FMI. Ahora, por otra parte, poder cambiar esto requiere de alinear voluntades internacionales y eso es algo que no se logra en poco tiempo. Es cierto que hoy hay un problema que enfrenta Argentina y un problema más general que enfrenta el mundo, que es que las líneas de crédito que tienen los organismos multilaterales son líneas de crédito que se pensaron para los problemas que exhibía el mundo en el siglo XX, no los problemas del siglo XXI. Y hay todo un proceso que transitar para adaptar esas líneas de crédito teniendo en cuenta que hoy los grandes problemas de la humanidad son, por ejemplo, el cambio climático más que la inestabilidad de la balanza de pagos que llevó a problemas como la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Hoy tenemos un problema nosotros. Lo que dice la vicepresidenta es correcto desde el punto de vista de que cuanto más tiempo tengamos para pagar, mejor; pero, al mismo tiempo, hay que ir buscando establecer acuerdos que nos permitan tener el horizonte financiero más despejado y esto va a ser una tarea laboriosa. Va a llevar años poder estar en tierra firme, con condiciones tales que Argentina esté claramente sin ningún problema en el frente financiero.”

Cristina Fernández de Kirchner dijo “Esa deuda es impagable” en un discurso encendido, muy antinorteamericano en el momento que usted está negociando con el gobierno norteamericano. ¿Cómo afecta eso las negociaciones? ¿Las ayuda o las perjudica?

“Las cosas hay que decirlas con franqueza. Ahí se está planteando una realidad. Dice: “No se tiene memoria de un préstamo así” y eso es cierto. Lo que se busca, justamente, es poder cambiar una posición que le ha hecho mal a Argentina, una posición donde las responsabilidades son compartidas: poder tener una negociación que nos sirva. Si ves lo que pasó cuando terminamos la gira en Washington, la semana anterior, el Fondo Monetario Internacional publicó un comunicado en el cual se manifestó cuáles son los principios de la política económica en los que el gobierno argentino y el Fondo están de acuerdo. Y fíjate que ese comunicado es un comunicado que está diciendo claramente que los principios en los que se basó la política de Juntos por el Cambio no son principios que le hagan bien a la Argentina. En cambio, los principios en los que se basa la política económica de nuestro gobierno son aquellos principios en los que se debe basar un acuerdo con el Fondo”.

Pero el Fondo también dijo: “Son diez años y no puedo inventar otra cosa”. Está en la misma posición que antes de las declaraciones de Cristina Fernández de Kirchner… ¿Esto abre una discusión nueva?

“Es que los diez años es una cuestión que tiene que ver con las líneas de crédito que existen en el Fondo Monetario Internacional. Cambiar eso requiere del apoyo de países como Estados Unidos, China, Alemania, Japón, Francia. Un cambio que justamente tienen que votar. No es una negociación técnica que se da entre el staff del Fondo Monetario Internacional y el gobierno argentino: es una negociación de carácter geopolítico que no hay tiempo suficiente si uno quisiera tener un acuerdo pronto. Para poder lograr algo así hace falta mucho más tiempo y hay incertidumbre al respecto. La pregunta es: ¿Vale como parte nosotros, como miembros del FMI y del G20, buscar implantar una discusión que lleve a transformación en las líneas de crédito del Fondo Monetario Internacional para resolver los problemas estructurales que tiene el mundo y por supuesto que ayude primeramente en nuestro caso a la Argentina? Por supuesto que vale. ¿Hay tiempo ahora para tener un cambio en la línea de crédito con respecto a esta de diez años si es que queremos tener un programa en mayo o junio? No, no va a pasar. Nosotros lo que decimos es: bueno, hay algo que es un problema. Es tan grande el préstamo que tomó el gobierno de Juntos por el Cambio que tenemos un problema y cualquier acuerdo de diez años nos pone una tensión. Pero contamos con estas herramientas. Si ahora se llega a un acuerdo lo importante es que haya condiciones que si después hay cambios en las líneas de crédito y se alargan los plazos, Argentina pueda acceder a esas mejores condiciones”.

¿Está Cristina Fernández de Kirchner dispuesta a aceptar un acuerdo que persista en los diez años de plazo?

“Siempre obviamente depende de cuál sea el apuro para un acuerdo, cuál sea la implicancia del acuerdo. Nosotros lo que decimos es que la única razón por la que necesitamos un acuerdo es porque no podemos pagarle entre septiembre de 2021 y el 2024 al Fondo Monetario Internacional US$ 45.000 millones. Lo peor de todo sería hacer un acuerdo apurado basado en premisas que le hagan mal a la Argentina. Eso nos haría mucho daño. Lo principal es que el acuerdo tenga un sentido que es el de ayudar a la Argentina. Si tuviéramos un acuerdo lo suficientemente bueno que incluya cláusulas tales que si después cambian las líneas de crédito del Fondo, Argentina se puede beneficiar de eso, estaríamos claramente en una posición más favorable que si no estamos en esa línea”.

¿Cuánto poder tiene el ministro de Economía, cuando sus subalternos y la vicepresidenta contradicen lo que él afirma? Por ejemplo, con la fórmula para actualizar jubilaciones cambiada por el Congreso, las tarifas en el presupuesto, el acuerdo con el Fondo.

“Eso no es correcto. Hay una posición que es la misma. El Frente de Todos lo que quiere es mejorar la calidad de vida de las argentinas y los argentinos. Y para eso necesitamos lograr varias cosas, entre ellas poder renegociar la deuda con el Fondo de una forma que sea sostenible. Y estamos negociando. Y obviamente estas son negociaciones en donde hay firmeza, dureza, de todas las partes, también de parte del Fondo, también de los países que forman parte de esto. O sea que aquí se busca siempre, en cada uno de los temas que son clave para el desarrollo de nuestro país, construir una síntesis. En el año 2020 se alcanzaron síntesis importantes. En el año 2021 se han ido construyendo síntesis en cada uno de estos temas que mencionás y podemos ir uno por uno”.

Tarifas, por ejemplo, donde el Presupuesto plantea que los subsidios se mantienen constantes respecto de 2020.

“Con respecto al producto. Es algo sobre lo que estamos trabajando para cumplirlo. Siempre hay diversas opiniones. Pero esto pasa en la gestión día a día. Cada quien que está en cada lugar tira para ese lugar y es lógico, tiene que funcionar así. Cada quien defiende la misión que le toca. A mí me toca mirar el todo. Y acá lo que tenemos que tener es una redefinición de cómo se invierten los recursos del Estado de forma de poder abordar los problemas estructurales, los problemas más graves que tiene la economía argentina atacando el problema de la inflación, el problema de la pobreza, el problema de la desigualdad. Este tema de los subsidios es un tema importante, porque si aumentan los subsidios en relación al producto significa que estamos destinando más recursos a algo que no es gasto de alta calidad. Necesitamos destinar más recursos a la ciencia, a la innovación en el desarrollo, a la educación, a la salud pública, a la infraestructura pública. Y estamos trabajando para eso. Ahora, también sucede que tenemos una situación en la cual hay grandes heterogeneidades en nuestra población en cuanto al poder adquisitivo, la vida que llevan”.

Eso sería segmentar. Pero en la semana, el funcionario Federico Basualdo, mientras se hablaba de aumentos en la tarifa de electricidad del 30%, dijo 9%. Distinto a lo que se dijo desde Economía.

“No depende del ministro. Los entes no dependen del ministerio de Economía, dependen directamente del presidente, pero se trabaja de una forma coordinada. Como digo: todo el mundo planteando la problemática que enfrenta desde su función. Y hay alguien que en la economía tiene que mirar todo. ¿Quién es ese? Bueno, soy yo. Es el ministro de Economía. Con el tema tarifas lo que vamos a hacer es lo siguiente. Primero: va a haber un aumento que no es el mismo para todos. Lo que se busca es focalizar los subsidios en quienes más lo necesitan. El aumento para los que están peor va a ser más bajo: va a implicar una reducción de la carga de las tarifas para sus ingresos. El aumento para los que están más arriba en la escala de ingresos va a ser más alto. Ahora: no se va a dar de un momento para otro, esto es un proceso que se va a ir dando durante el año. Si aumentás en las tarifas solamente un dígito para todo el mundo ahí no se estaría cumpliendo el presupuesto y no se estaría cumpliendo el programa macroeconómico. Eso no se va a hacer. ¿Qué se va a hacer? Va a haber, posiblemente partido en dos. Pero fijate: los aumentos de los que estamos hablando son aumentos que tienen que ver con mantener ciertos equilibrios y salir del esquema que adoptó Juntos por el Cambio, que implicaría aumentos de arriba de 100% de las tarifas para todo el mundo. Nada así se va a hacer. Posiblemente se parta en dos un aumento general y después, en el marco de una ley de emergencia tarifaria que el presidente anunció en la Asamblea Legislativa, haya aumentos o quita de subsidios para quien lo necesita y se mantenga el subsidio −o incluso se agrande− para quien lo necesita, que es la tarifa social. Es posible que la parte que es igual para todo el mundo sea de dos dígitos y se reparta en dos partes. Y que, como digo, a lo largo del año cuando vayamos identificando a quien no necesita el subsidio o que no es quien más lo necesita, esos reciban un aumento más alto y eso implique que se pueda cumplir con la meta del presupuesto y que por lo tanto el Estado cuente con los recursos para poder invertir en la educación y en todo lo demás”.

¿En la suma total entonces no subirían el porcentaje de los subsidios respecto del Producto Bruto?

“1,7% del Producto Bruto. Eso es la meta establecida en el presupuesto y eso es para lo que se está trabajando. Insisto, esto sí que es muy importante: lo que estamos haciendo es ordenar esta cuestión del cuadro tarifario, estaba muy desordenada. Si no hacíamos nada e íbamos con el esquema del gobierno anterior, eso le hubiera hecho mucho daño a la gente. Si aumentamos o si se congelasen las tarifas, eso también le haría mucho daño a la Argentina. Hay que tener un equilibrio y en eso estamos trabajando”.

¿Cuánto margen tienen el ministro de Economía y el presidente respecto de temas como tarifas o inflación para imponer los criterios que están en el presupuesto, dado que da la sensación de que un sector del gobierno lo va modificando?

“Gobernar también es ir construyendo entendimientos colectivos. Colectivos en un sentido bien amplio: cuanto más colectivos sean, mejor. Y uno de mis roles es contribuir a eso: es contribuir a un proceso social de generar entendimientos, generar consensos, generar acuerdos sobre lo que Argentina necesita para tener una economía más tranquila”.

Pero hay un sector del kirchnerismo que dice: “Tenemos un ministro de Economía que es demasiado liberal, está graduado de una universidad pública pero muy conservador”. Hebe de Bonafini dijo: “Es un traidor y un mentiroso”. Al final del día lo importante es la credibilidad del presupuesto.

“Lo aprobó el Congreso, que es donde están representadas todas las alas del Frente de Todos. Y estamos hablando de dirigentes de una importancia fundamental en el armado de nuestro frente. Dirigentes que tienen un compromiso con la Argentina, que tienen fuerza para llevar adelante ese compromiso y que trabajamos todos de una forma aunada construyendo síntesis sobre lo que le hace bien a la Argentina. Ese proceso tiene muchísimo valor para nuestro país. Ese proceso de reflexión, de ponernos de acuerdo en cuáles son los pilares fundamentales para nuestra economía, es un proceso que vale mucho.”

Si llega a buen puerto…

“Es lo que viene ocurriendo. Hemos venido construyendo. Fíjate lo que pasó en el año 2020 con la política económica. Durante todo el año, un año muy difícil de pandemia, arrancando por la reestructuración de la deuda externa, por reconstruir el mercado de deuda pública en pesos, por ir atendiendo la pandemia definiendo principios: primero la salud, segundo proteger el saber hacer a la economía y al trabajo, tercero los sectores vulnerables. Se ejecutó de una forma que se pudo lidiar con una situación realmente excepcional y durísima para todo el mundo habiendo alcanzado síntesis donde todos fuimos para el mismo lado”.

Pero la pobreza llegó a 42% pandemia mediante y si se mira el presupuesto, con la segunda ola, no hay margen para que el Estado siga asistiendo si es fuerte.

“También sucede que hubo mucho aprendizaje recorrido durante 2020 y hubo una preparación del sistema de salud para lidiar con la pandemia. No es lo mismo lo que se sabe hoy, aun cuando falta mucho por saberse sobre qué significa esta pandemia, que en marzo de 2020 cuando esto comenzó. Por lo tanto hoy estamos con capacidades distintas para lidiar con la situación pura de la salud. Por supuesto que, desde el punto de vista económico, buena parte de ese margen ya se utilizó. Hoy la economía no podría soportar un cierre total, una cuarentena estricta del tipo Fase 1 como aquella que se implementó en marzo de 2020, pero esa no es la idea”.

¿Cuál es el plan B desde lo económico ante la segunda ola?

“Desde el punto de vista de las restricciones de circulación va a ser otra historia de lo que fue en marzo de 2020. Pensemos que la economía está diseñada, preparada, funciona con circulación. Entonces por más que haya pandemia el efecto sobre la economía es menor. Fijémonos en lo que está pasando ahora: todavía estamos en pandemia. Pero llevamos nueve meses consecutivos de actividad económica creciendo. Lleva una mejora en la gran mayoría de los indicadores. Hay sectores que por supuesto están sufriendo los efectos de la pandemia pero se han estado recuperando muy fuerte. De hecho, hemos revisado hacia el alta los pronósticos de crecimiento para 2020. Era 5,5% en la proyección de septiembre de 2020 y hoy es 7%, que también es un pronóstico prudente, porque conviene ser prudentes. Pero la realidad es que la pandemia está, la pandemia golpea a todo el mundo, pero las políticas que se adoptaron en 2020 permitieron que estemos en una situación mejor que otros países de la región, habiendo protegido el trabajo y el capital de la economía. La argentina es la economía que más se está recuperando”.

Martín Guzmán opina sobre si Argentina podría volver a una cuarentena 1:09

Pero también es la que más rápido cayó.

“9,9% fue la caída del Producto, inferior al 12,5% que se proyectaba en septiembre”.

Comparado con Brasil, Uruguay y Chile, la Argentina cayó más.

“Ojo que si mirás en todo el continente, Argentina no es la que peor le fue. Por supuesto que tuvo una caída, pero no hay que mirarla en términos absolutos: hay que mirarla en relación a cuál era la proyección antes de la pandemia. Nosotros veníamos de una crisis económica muy profunda −año 2018 y 2019− y la proyección era una caída del Producto en 2020. Es decir que si comparás la caída de 9,9 del Producto con la caída que se proyectaba no nos fue peor que a la mayoría”.

Eso es manejo de cifras y de expectativas. Si es uno de los países que más cae tiene su lógica que sea de los que más se recupere.

“Eso depende, no siempre pasa. Si hay destrucción de capital los efectos de una crisis persisten en el tiempo”.

¿Usted no evalúa la perspectiva de un escenario de otro golpe fuerte de coronavirus que signifique un golpe fuerte a la economía y requiera más asistencia a la gente?

“Las medidas que ayudaron mucho, como el IFE, como el ATP, no son medidas que tengan que ver solamente con la pandemia. Tuvieron que ver con la pandemia y con las restricciones de circulación. Y hoy no tenemos restricciones de circulación y no vamos a tener restricciones de circulación como al inicio de la pandemia.”

¿Este año recuperaríamos parte de lo que se perdió pero no todo si se cumplen estas previsiones?

“No se espera que se recupere todo, se espera que se recupere una parte importante”.

¿Y la inflación?

[En] “inflación lo que apuntamos es una reducción gradual consistente de la inflación. Nosotros teníamos una proyección de que el primer trimestre iba a ser un primer trimestre con niveles más altos que para el resto del año. Además, esto tiene que ver con un conjunto de factores”.

¿Es inteligente seguir con un 29%? ¿No se repite un error de Macri que fijó metas de inflación que eran incumplibles, viendo los precios de estos meses que ya es cercana al 15%?

“Hay dos cuestiones aquí. Primero: la proyección entre lo que ocurrió en el primer trimestre con respecto a qué expectativa del primer trimestre. Porque nosotros esperábamos un primer trimestre con inflación alta. Más o menos así. ¿Y la proyección hacia delante de quién?”

Si se proyecta este primer cuatrimestre da muy alto el índice de inflación.

“Extrapolar lo de los primeros tres meses a todo el año sería un error. El 29% es el objetivo de política macroeconómica. Y hay políticas macroeconómicas, incluyendo la monetaria y la cambiaria −sobre todo la política cambiaria− que se aplicó entendiendo que se concentraba parte de la depreciación del tipo de cambio programada para todo el año en el primer trimestre. La tasa de depreciación va bajando y hay gestiones del Estado concretas para ir enderezando esta cuestión. Por eso pregunto: ¿quién proyecta? Si miramos lo que pasó en 2020 y me dan las proyecciones del mercado, la inflación que proyectaban era entre 50 y 60%. Nosotros, les decíamos, apuntábamos en que fuera entre el 22 y el 40% y fue del 36%.

Por sí o por no: ¿evalúa la posibilidad de hacer una política similar a la que hace Biden en Estados Unidos, de aplicar un nuevo impuesto a los sectores más pudientes para que los sectores menos pudientes tengan un poco más de plata en el bolsillo?

“Esta es una cuestión más estructural. Nosotros tenemos que tener una estructura tributaria más progresiva. Se han ido dando pasos en esa dirección. Un paso que ya dimos, todavía estaba el presidente anterior en el gobierno de Estados Unidos. Nosotros en diciembre de 2019 dimos un paso muy importante para tener una estructura tributaria más progresiva que fue la Ley de Solidaridad Social y Reactivación Productiva. Eso importó en 2020. Y hoy estamos viendo un aumento de la recaudación en términos reales por encima de la inflación, que en parte tiene que ver con las medidas que se adoptaron a fines de 2019. Y hay que seguir transitando ese camino”.",2021-04-03 00:00:00

"Regé-Jean Page deja""Bridgerton"": no estará en segunda temporada","(CNN) — Ese grito que pudiste escuchar son los fans de Simon Basset, el duque de Hastings, personaje que interpreta Regé-Jean Page.

Este viernes se anunció que el actor que le dio vida al extremadamente atractivo protagonista no interpretará su papel en la segunda temporada de «Bridgerton«, el exitoso drama histórico de Netflix.

La triste noticia llegó para algunos a través de una nota del personaje Lady Whistledown, que se publicó en la cuenta de Twitter verificada de «Bridgerton».

«Estimados lectores, mientras toda la atención se centra en la búsqueda de la vicecondesa para Lord Anthony Bridgerton, nos despedimos de Regé-Jean Page, quien interpretó triunfalmente al duque de Hastings», se leía en la publicación. «Extrañaremos la presencia de Simon en la pantalla, pero siempre será parte de la familia Bridgerton», añadió.

Preguntas sobre las vacunas contra el coronavirus

Dr. Huerta,

he estado internado 20 dias

x Covid me dieron de alta y

hoy estoy mejor

la pregunta es despues de

cuanto tiempo me puedo

vacunar — ismael machuca rico (@RicoMachuca) March 31, 2021

Hola Ismael. De acuerdo con los Centros de Prevención y Control de Enfermedades (CDC), la persona que ha sufrido covid-19 puede vacunarse en cualquier momento después de haber pasado la enfermedad, aunque se recomienda que lo haga después de los 3 meses, pues se considera que la inmunidad natural lo protege por lo menos hasta esa fecha.

@drhuerta Cual es la eficacia y eficiencia de la Vacuna de Sinopharm vs la de Sinovac, sirven para todo tipo de adulto ambas? — Marco Vidal (@MarcoVidHu) March 31, 2021

Hola Marco. Como lo dijimos en el episodio del 4 de marzo, eficacia y efectividad no significan lo mismo.

La eficacia se calcula en un ensayo clínico controlado en el que se escoge qué tipo de voluntarios participan, y se compara la vacuna contra un placebo.

La efectividad se calcula vacunando a todo tipo de personas en la vida real, y se comparan los vacunados contra los no vacunados.

Hasta ahora, para las vacunas chinas solo hay datos de eficacia, las cuales son de 79,34% para Sinopharm y de 50,38 en un ensayo en Brasil y 83,5% en un ensayo en Turquía para Sinovac.

Aún no tenemos datos de efectividad para las vacunas chinas.

@drhuerta hola Dr Huerta, un amigo recibió la vacuna de Pfizer y al siguiente día comenzó con síntomas, los cuales pensó que eran reacción a la vacuna. Estos síntomas empeoraron, así que se hizo test y resultó positivo a covid. Su %SpO2 bajó mucho y terminó en hospital. — Alex Perry García 🌀 (@PerryTheReal) March 31, 2021

Muy buena pregunta Alex. Lo que pudo haber pasado es que tu amigo se vacunó estando ya contagiado, por lo que al día siguiente empezaron los síntomas. La enfermedad que desarrolló es la misma enferemedad que hubiera desarrollado sin estar vacunado, es decir con una probabilidad del 80% leve, 15% severa y 5% grave que requiere hospitalización. Lamentablemente, tu amigo cayó en el último grupo. Lo siento mucho.

@drhuerta una pregunta, hay algún estudio dónde de pueda leer si utilizan primero una vacuna de cierta casa y la segunda dosis se aplica de otra casa farmacéutica — Andie (@AQuevaz) March 31, 2021

Hola Andie. Esa es una buena pregunta, lamentablemente no conozco ningún estudio que describa esa situación.

Debo recordarte sin embargo que lo aconsejable es completar la vacunación con la misma vacuna.

@drhuerta ¿ Todas las Vacunas son efectivas con las tres variantes (mutaciones), existentes hasta ahora? — Silvestre (@SilvestreTalice) March 31, 2021

Silvestre, como lo vimos en el episodio del 18 de febrero, hay algunos indicios de que las vacunas son menos eficaces contra las variantes.

Sin embargo, según datos publicados este 1 de abril por Pfizer y BioNTech, su vacuna parece ser totalmente eficaz contra la preocupante variante B.1.351 del virus, que es la cepa dominante que circula en Sudáfrica.

Por otro lado, la vacuna de AstraZeneca tuvo que ser retirada del programa de vacunación en Sudáfrica, debido a la nula eficacia contra la variante B.1.351

@MauFernandini @mabel_huertas Por favor hacer la pregunta al @drhuerta si una persona q toma warfarina operada del corazón como se debe poner la vacuna Pfizer en forma intramuscular o subcutánea? Agradezco la respuesta — Elvis (@elvistq) March 31, 2021

Hola Elvis, claro que sí. Se han hecho estudios con la vacuna contra la gripe -que también usa la vía intramuscular- y se ha visto que las personas que toman warfarina no tienen problemas después de la vacunación.

Doctor Elmer saludos desde Perú, podría indicarnos en su podcast si alguna vacuna actual para covid tiene contraindicaciones con personas con Arritmia y fibrilación auticular o hay datos si estan vacunando en INCOR @EsSaludPeru — Anthony.05 (@AnthOny_28_05) March 31, 2021

Hola Anthony. No conozco de ninguna vacuna que no pueda ser aplicada en personas con arritmia, fibrilación auricular u otro problema del corazón.

Al revés, recuerda que las personas con enfermedades crónicas del corazón están en riesgo de complicarse si contraen covid-19, por lo que deben vacunarse.

@drhuerta Buenas noches Dr, una pregunta una persona que tiene herpes zoster, ¿es recomendable se vacune contra el covid19? — Mario Ortiz Carreño (@MarioAOC) March 31, 2021

Hola Mario. No conozco de ninguna contraindicación para que una persona que haya tenido herpes zoster se vacune.

Obviamente, si la persona tiene herpes zoster y está muy mortificada por los síntomas, debe esperar a recuperarse antes de vacunarse.

@drhuerta cuánto dura la protección que da la vacuna? Esto quiere decir que al pasar el efecto debemos vacunarnos nuevamente (se habla de que la protección es de 3 a 8 meses, esto es verdad?).- — Made (@made_mejia2) March 31, 2021

Hola Made, como decía Pfizer y BioNTech dieron a conocer -mediante comunicado de prensa– que el análisis de los datos del estudio de fase 3 hasta el 13 de marzo, demuestran que la vacuna sigue dando protección por lo menos seis meses después de haberse completado las dos dosis, incluyendo en Sudáfrica, lo cual es una buena noticia.

Es probable que la protección dure incluso más que eso, dicen los expertos en vacunas.

Habrá que esperar el análisis de los 12 meses, para saber si la vacuna todavía protege todo ese tiempo.

Hola, me llamo Nathalia, disculpe estaba buscando info sobre este tema y me encontré con este tweet. Yo tuve SGB hace ya casi cinco años y cuando me fui a vacunar me recomendaron no hacerlo porque no había info suficiente para saber qué me pasaría luego. Ud ya se vacunó? — Nathalia (@N_Villarroel_) March 30, 2021

Hola Nathalia. De acuerdo con los CDC, las personas que han sufrido Guillain-Barré sí pueden recibir las vacunas de Pfizer, Moderna o Johnson & Johnson.

@drhuerta qué consecuencias tendría sino recibo mi segunda dosis de vacuna contra el COVID 19 (Pfizer) dentro los 21 días, o si la recibo a los 45 días o más? Baja el % de eficacia? — RSM (@Tacorora) March 30, 2021

Ese punto no esta estudiado, RSM, pero teóricamente, la segunda dosis -aún 45 días después de la primera- podría darte el refuerzo que necesitas para estar completamente protegido.

Te ruego que hables con tu médico.

@drhuerta a los cuántos días de vacunado soy inmune, y esa inmunidad cuanto tiempo dura, gracias — Marino Garzon Agredo (@agredo_garzon) March 30, 2021

Hola Marino. Se considera que la inmunidad empieza a desarrollarse 10 a 15 días después de la primera dosis, lográndose -para las vacunas que necesitan dos dosis- una protección parcial después de esa fecha.

Preguntas sobre la ivermectina

Entiendo que no cura, pero dicen algo si aminora los efectos o también es falso??? — Gissella YB (@GyseYb) March 31, 2021

Buena pregunta Gissella. De acuerdo con el comunicado de la OMS, el análisis de los datos de 16 ensayos controlados aleatorios, con 2.407 personas estudiadas, incluidos pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios con covid-19, demostró que la ivermectina no reduce la mortalidad, la necesidad de ventilación mecánica, la necesidad de ingreso hospitalario, ni disminuye el tiempo para la mejoría clínica en los pacientes con covid-19.

Astrid pregunta: Con respecto a la ivermectina, sé que no cura, y solo baja algunos síntomas en algunas personas. Tengo mis dudas con respecto a los efectos secundarios. ¿Podría decirme cuáles son?

Hola Astrid, excelente pregunta. De acuerdo con la Administración de Medicinas y Alimentos de Estados Unidos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés), algunos de los efectos secundarios que pueden estar asociados con la ivermectina incluyen:

Erupción cutánea,

Náuseas,

Vómitos,

Diarrea,

Dolor de estómago,

Hinchazón facial o de las extremidades,

Mareos,

Convulsiones,

Confusión,

Descenso repentino de la presión arterial,

Erupción cutánea grave – requiriendo potencial hospitalización-

Y daño hepático o hepatitis.

Preguntas sobre la reinfección de coronavirus

Buenas tardes doctor, una pregunta, si una persona padecio covid 19 hace meses y se recupero totalmente, pero en estos momentos su pareja padece la enfermedad, la persona recuperada puede contagiar a otras personas a pesar de que el ya no se enferne? — FRIEDLAND (@FRIEDLA82499789) March 30, 2021

Esa es una buena pregunta Friedland. Teóricamente, puede suceder, pero no conocemos de algún estudio que haya estudiado ese particular hecho.

@drhuerta Hola Dr.! Soy de Argentina y me contagié del Covid en enero/21. Tengo 70 años y lo pase en mi domicilio, 11 días con fiebre y luego 11 con falta de aire no grave. Soy asmático desde bebé. Me hice un post-Covid completo y estoy bien. Me puedo reinfectar? Gracias! — Roberto (@RobAriola) March 30, 2021

Saludos Roberto. Como lo hemos escuchado en episodios anteriores, la reinfección es un hecho científicamente aceptado, por lo que una persona que ya ha superado el covid-19, debe seguir cuidándose como si no lo hubiera tenido.

Otras preguntas sobre el covid-19

@drhuerta sería usted tan amable de decirme qué significa que en un hospital digan los doctores que el estado del paciente es delicado? Lamentablemente por la saturación de pacientes con Coviv sólo eso escribieron en una lista sobre un paciente — Jose Ramos (@Guatejose) April 1, 2021

Hola José, muy buena pregunta. Según el Hospital Johns Hopkins en Baltimore, estas son algunas definiciones de utilidad para entender la categorización del estado de salud de un paciente:

Estable : los signos vitales -pulso, temperatura, presión arterial, respiraciones- son estables y se encuentran dentro de los límites normales. El paciente está consciente, pero puede sentirse incómodo, pero los indicadores de pronóstico son favorables.

: los signos vitales -pulso, temperatura, presión arterial, respiraciones- son estables y se encuentran dentro de los límites normales. El paciente está consciente, pero puede sentirse incómodo, pero los indicadores de pronóstico son favorables. Grave o delicado : los signos vitales pueden ser inestables, no estar dentro de los límites normales, por lo que el paciente está gravemente enfermo, y los indicadores de pronóstico son dudosos.

: los signos vitales pueden ser inestables, no estar dentro de los límites normales, por lo que el paciente está gravemente enfermo, y los indicadores de pronóstico son dudosos. Crítico : los signos vitales son inestables y no están dentro de los límites normales. El paciente puede estar inconsciente, y los indicadores de pronóstico son desfavorables.

@drhuerta

Muy buenos dias dr.,Leyendo un articulo sobre el covid-19 me sorprendió parte de ese artículo y era el por que los patológos no hacen autopsias para saber a ciencia cierta las causa de su muerte,Si antes los patólogos encontraban causas y después la cura.Horientenos — Robert Ponce de Leon (@ropoleca) March 30, 2021

Hola, Robert. En realidad, sí se hacen.

Es más, se considera que las autopsias que ya no se practicaban con la frecuencia de antes, han tenido un aumento en esta pandemia.

@drhuerta Buenas noches ¿Podría indicarme si el vértigo está relacionado con el Covid19? Gracias. — Cielo (@Cielo79291413) March 30, 2021

Hola, Cielo. Como lo vimos en el episodio del 29 de marzo, un reciente estudio demostró que el covid-19 está asociado a que:

El 7,6% de personas presenten pérdida de audición,

14,8% tinnitus

Y 7,2% vértigo rotatorio, que es la condición en la que una persona siente que todas las cosas que la rodean giran alrededor de ella.

Preguntas @drhuerta 1. ¿Qué tan beneficiosos son los suplementos de vitamina “C” (polvos, pastillas para diluir en agua) para la prevención del COVID, estando sanos? Desde que inició la pandemia, mi esposa y yo los tomamos cada dos días. 2. ¿Después de estar inoculados es 🧵 — Alberto Iglesias D 🇲🇽🇪🇸🇪🇺 (@albertitoiglesi) March 29, 2021

Hola, Alberto. No hay prueba científica de que los suplementos de vitamina C tengan algún efecto en la prevención de covid-19.

La vitamina C es importante para el sistema de defensa, pero debe obtenerse de los alimentos.

La embajada dijo en un comunicado en su página oficial de Facebook que ahora solo hay 290 expatriados en Corea del Norte, incluyendo a sólo nueve embajadores y cuatro diplomáticos. Todo el personal extranjero que trabaja para ONGs y organizaciones humanitarias ha abandonado el país.

«No todo el mundo puede soportar la severidad de las restricciones totales sin precedentes, la acuciante escasez de suministros de primera necesidad, incluyendo medicinas (y) la falta de oportunidades para resolver los problemas de salud», decía la embajada en el comunicado, en el que también expresaba sus buenos deseos a unos 38 ciudadanos extranjeros que terminaron su cuarentena post-Corea del Norte en China.

Antes de la pandemia de covid-19, Rusia tenía una de las mayores misiones diplomáticas en Corea del Norte, pero su presencia ha disminuido recientemente. El hecho de vivir durante meses con estrictas medidas de salud pública y hacer frente a la extrema escasez de «bienes necesarios», incluyendo medicinas, parece haber hecho mella.

Las fronteras de Corea del Norte llevan meses bloqueadas como parte de los esfuerzos del régimen de Kim Jong Un para mantener a raya al covid-19, dejando varados a los pocos diplomáticos que operan dentro de Pyongyang.

La aerolínea estatal norcoreana Air Koryo opera vuelos desde Vladivostok, en el este de Rusia, pero la ruta también está suspendida desde hace meses. Al parecer, salir de Corea del Norte es bastante difícil. En febrero, varios diplomáticos rusos pasaron más de 34 horas intentando salir del país, un viaje agotador que terminó con al menos un enviado empujando su equipaje y sus hijos pequeños en un carrito de tren.

Los expertos creen que Kim decidió cortar casi todos los lazos de Corea del Norte con el mundo exterior porque admitió que el sistema sanitario de su país, tan deteriorado, se vería desbordado por un brote de covid-19.

La estrategia de Kim parece haber funcionado desde el punto de vista de la salud pública. Corea del Norte no ha reportado ningún brote considerable de covid-19, y no ha habido indicios de que se haya producido uno, aunque los expertos dudan de la afirmación de Pyongyang de que el país no ha visto ni un solo caso del virus.

Los diplomáticos, trabajadores humanitarios y personal de ONGs han optado por abandonar Corea del Norte antes de correr el riesgo de quedarse varados debido a los rígidos e inflexibles controles fronterizos del país, lo que ha reducido la ya pequeña comunidad de expatriados de Pyongyang, una valiosa fuente de información sobre uno de los países más herméticos del mundo. Sin embargo, los diplomáticos rusos han ayudado a llenar algunas de las lagunas en sus descripciones de la vida sobre el terreno en la capital norcoreana.

El embajador de Rusia en Corea del Norte, Alexander Matsegora, dijo recientemente que las tiendas de abarrotes comenzaron a quedarse sin alimentos tras la decisión de Pyongyang de detener casi por completo las importaciones en septiembre. Los comentarios fueron sorprendentes, dado que Corea del Norte mantiene relaciones más estrechas con Rusia que con casi cualquier otro país, a excepción de China.

Si bien Kim y otros líderes norcoreanos han admitido que la economía del país sufre debido al virus, no han admitido que su suministro de alimentos esté bajo presión.

MLB muda de Georgia Juego de las Estrellas por nuevas leyes electorales,"(CNN) –– La MLB anunció este viernes que el Juego de las Estrellas y el draft de esta temporada no se realizarán en Atlanta, como respuesta a las leyes electorales que Georgia aprobó recientemente y que imponen nuevas restricciones al voto.

La ciudad que será la nueva anfitriona del juego del 13 de julio aún está por anunciarse, de acuerdo a las Grandes Ligas.

«Durante la última semana, hemos tenido conversaciones reflexivas con los clubes, los jugadores antiguos y actuales, la Asociación de Jugadores y la Alianza de Jugadores, entre otros, para escuchar sus opiniones», señaló el comisionado de la MLB, Rob Manfred, en un comunicado. «He decidido que la mejor manera de demostrar nuestros valores como deporte es cambiando la sede del Juego de las Estrellas y del draft de la MLB de este año», añadió.

Recientemente, Georgia aprobó nuevas leyes electorales, lo que llevó a los críticos a pedir que se boicotearan las empresas radicadas en el estado y a que las ligas deportivas consideraran trasladar los grandes eventos. Los CEO y otros líderes de alto rango de más de 100 empresas ––incluyendo Target, Snapchat y Uber–– emitieron un comunicado este viernes en el que se oponen a cualquier medida que niegue a ciudadanos elegibles el derecho a votar.

«Las Grandes Ligas del Béisbol apoyan en esencia el derecho al voto de todos los estadounidenses y se oponen a las restricciones en las urnas», sostuvo Manfred en el comunicado.

La nueva ley de Georgia planeta impedimentos adicionales para votar, al reducir el número de urnas en zonas con gran presencia estadounidenses negros. También permite la intervención del estado para controlar el curso de las elecciones en los condados demócratas. Además, reduce el tiempo disponible para el voto por correo. Y a eso se suma que crea nuevos requisitos de registro que, según activistas, se diseñaron para perjudicar a los votantes negros.

«Hoy, la MLB cedió al miedo, al oportunismo político y a las mentiras liberales», publicó el gobernador de Georgia, Brian Kemp en su cuenta de Twitter. «Los ciudadanos de Georgia ––y todos los estadounidenses–– deberían entender perfectamente lo que significa la decisión exabrupta de la MLB: la cultura la cancelación y los activistas políticos persiguiendo todos los aspectos de tu vida, incluidos los deportes. Si la izquierda no está de acuerdo contigo, los hechos y la verdad no importan», completó.

Today, @MLB caved to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies.

Horas antes este viernes, Kemp, republicano, tuiteó: «Los hechos son algo tercos. A pesar de la indignación de la izquierda, estamos haciendo que votar sea fácil y hacer trampa difícil en Georgia».

Stacey Abrams, activista por el derecho al voto y exlíder demócrata de la Cámara de Representantes de Georgia, acudió a Twitter para pronunciarse al respecto. En su mensaje señaló que estaba decepcionada por la decisión de la MLB de trasladar el partido. Sin embargo, añadió que se sentía orgullosa de la postura de las Grandes Ligas sobre el derecho al voto.

My full statement on @MLB All-Star Game: #gapol pic.twitter.com/mq4DauVQ8B

Abrams también publicó una declaración adicional en Twitter. En esa nota sostuvo que los legisladores estatales republicanos que aprobaron el proyecto de ley tomaron esa decisión conociendo los riesgos económicos para Georgia.

«Dieron prioridad a hacer el voto más difícil para las personas de color sobre el bienestar económico de todos los georgianos», escribió en el comunicado.

La alcaldesa de Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, escribió que las acciones de los líderes electos tienen consecuencias.

«Desafortunadamente, el traslado del Juego de las Estrellas de la @MLB en Georgia es probablemente la primera de muchas fichas de dominó que caerán, hasta que se eliminen las barreras innecesarias para restringir el acceso a las urnas», tuiteó.

El partido se iba a jugar en el Truist Park de Atlanta, una de las ciudades donde Hank Aaron ––quien murió en enero–– fue aclamado como uno de los mejores jugadores de la historia del deporte. La MLB dijo que el homenaje a Aaron se mantiene en el Juego de las Estrellas de este verano.

Por su parte, el presidente Joe Biden dijo este miércoles que «apoyaría firmemente» trasladar el partido y sus festividades fuera de Atlanta.

(CNN) — Al principio, el termómetro marcaba 38,3. Pero cuando Ricardo Ramírez llegó al departamento de emergencias, su temperatura seguía subiendo. Comenzó a implorar por su vida, suplicando a extraños con bata, guantes y máscaras que le dieran algo para detener la fiebre.

Luego, el 23 de marzo de 2020, unas horas después de su llegada, la enfermedad golpeó a Ramírez de una vez: estaba seguro de que iba a morir.

«Empecé a llamar a mi familia, mi esposa y mis hijos». Ramírez tiene dos hijos, Ricardo Jr., de 14 años, y Rachelle, de 5. «Empecé a darle a mi hijo todas mis contraseñas y toda mi información personal para que las tuviera si me pasaba algo», le dijo a CNN.

«Estoy en el hospital y tú estás en casa», le dijo a su hijo. «Tú eres el hombre de la casa».

Ramírez, es un técnico biomédico de 55 años en el Hospital St. Charles en la ciudad de Nueva York. Y en ese momento, estaba viviendo el trauma que experimentaron tantos pacientes de covid-19: la sensación de que la muerte estaba a solo unos instantes de distancia.

No lo estaba. Regresó con su familia después de nueve angustiosas semanas en el hospital. Pero casi un año después, todavía puede recordar vívidamente el trauma de su hospitalización.

«Recuerdo que una vez me desperté y dije: ‘Dios, no me quiero morir’. Miré al techo de mi habitación y vi la cara de mi esposa llorando. Y mis hijos, ambos llorando detrás de ella. Luego me desperté y estaba llorando solo», le dijo a CNN en una entrevista telefónica.

Millones han sobrevivido a la hospitalización por covid-19 y, para la mayoría, los síntomas físicos agudos han desaparecido. Pero muchos continúan soportando el trauma emocional y psicológico que conlleva tener covid-19.

Un estudio publicado en febrero de 2021 encontró que el 30% de los sobrevivientes de covid-19 experimentaron trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT, en español, o PTSD, en inglés), una enfermedad psicológica que generalmente ocurre después de que alguien tiene una experiencia que amenaza su vida.

Si no se trata, el trastorno de estrés postraumático tiene el potencial de convertir una recuperación esperanzadora en una pesadilla viviente.

Y aunque los estudios posteriores a la epidemia de SARS en 2003-2004 encontraron tasas similares de estrés postraumático en alrededor del 25%, la escala de la pandemia de covid-19 es una diferencia clave. Con aproximadamente 30 millones de infecciones confirmadas en EE.UU. desde el inicio de la pandemia, algunos expertos dicen que el mundo debería prepararse para una crisis de salud mental.

Estrés postraumático y covid prolongado

El TEPT es un trastorno de salud mental en el que una persona experimenta pensamientos, flashbacks y pesadillas que golpean de manera impredecible y devuelven a la persona al momento del trauma. Volver a experimentar los recuerdos provoca ataques de pánico y problemas para dormir.

«Puede ocurrir en pacientes que experimentaron un evento traumático», dijo a CNN la Dra. Delfina Janiri, quien ayudó en un estudio de un solo centro publicado en febrero de 2021 en la Revista de la Asociación Médica Estadounidense de Psiquiatría y psiquiatra del Policlinicio Universitario Fondazione Agostino Gemelli en Italia. «Entonces, en este caso, consideramos haber experimentado una enfermedad de covid aguda y grave».

El estudio de Janiri incluyó a 381 pacientes tratados en un hospital en Roma, Italia, entre abril y octubre de 2020. Después de recuperarse de la infección, todos los pacientes fueron remitidos a un centro de atención posterior a la recuperación donde recibieron una evaluación psiquiátrica completa.

Los pacientes fueron evaluados por ansiedad, depresión, trastornos del estado de ánimo y estrés postraumático. «Nos sorprendió el hecho de que la mayoría de los síntomas que encontramos se agrupaban en torno al síndrome de estrés postraumático», dijo Janiri a CNN.

También buscaron características de los pacientes que aumentaran el riesgo de desarrollar estrés postraumático. El predictor más fuerte fue la persistencia de tres o más síntomas de covid-19, los mismos síntomas descritos por pacientes con «long-covid» o covid prolongado: fatiga, confusión mental, palpitaciones cardíacas, dificultad para respirar, dolores de cabeza y otros.

Se encontró que alrededor del 70% de las personas que informaron haber experimentado tres o más síntomas médicos persistentes tenían trastorno de estrés postraumático en comparación con el 31% de las personas con uno o dos, encontró el estudio.

«Encontramos una fuerte asociación entre el trastorno de estrés postraumático y esos síntomas», dijo Janiri. «Por supuesto, ahora no es posible para nosotros definir la direccionalidad, lo que significa que no sabemos qué fue primero, la causa y el efecto. Pero seguro que las personas que informan síntomas clínicos más persistentes también son personas que informan más síntomas de trastorno de estrés postraumático».

Un estudio anterior realizado en China que involucró a 714 pacientes hospitalizados en cinco hospitales en Wuhan en marzo de 2020, y publicado en Psychological Medicine, encontró que el 96% de las personas encuestadas tenían trastorno de estrés postraumático post-covid. La mitad de los pacientes encuestados dijeron que la asesoría de salud mental en línea sería útil.

Perseguidos por la UCI

El trastorno de estrés postraumático que ocurre después de ciertas hospitalizaciones no es un fenómeno nuevo, dijo el Dr. Ronald Brenner, psiquiatra y presidente de salud conductual de Catholic Health. Como sugieren algunas investigaciones, uno de cada cinco pacientes experimenta trastorno de estrés postraumático después de la admisión a la UCI.

«Pero en el covid, también está apareciendo en personas que tuvieron covid moderado a grave sin tener que ir a la UCI», dijo Brenner. Es difícil saber por qué es así, dijo Brenner, pero podría deberse a la alta tasa de mortalidad asociada con el covid-19.

Brenner está viendo las secuelas del virus de primera mano como psiquiatra. Uno de sus pacientes fue hospitalizado durante cinco días con covid-19, pero nunca requirió atención al nivel de la UCI. Ahora, cualquier tos, dolor u otro síntoma desencadena ansiedad y, a veces, ataques de pánico.

«Comenzó a tener verdaderos ataques de ansiedad por tener covid nuevamente, por que los síntomas no desaparecían, por tener covid residual para siempre», dijo Brenner. «Luego también tuvo grandes dificultades para volver al trabajo debido al problema de la evasión, por el miedo a ir al mismo lugar».

El trastorno de estrés postraumático hace que las personas eviten situaciones asociadas con el trauma, ya que pueden desencadenar pánico y ansiedad. El paciente todavía tiene dificultades en el trabajo, dijo Brenner.

Si bien se siente alentado por el hecho de que algunos pacientes han avanzado, Brenner dice que aún se necesita una estrategia integral para garantizar que todos los pacientes reciban la atención que necesitan. Y hay tratamientos que funcionan, dijo Brenner, como la terapia cognitivo-conductual o el tratamiento con medicamentos como antidepresivos o ansiolíticos.

Miedo al estigma

El Instituto Nacional de Salud Mental (NIMH, por sus siglas en inglés) actualmente está financiando investigaciones para comprender mejor el estrés postraumático post-covid, dijo la Dra. Susan Borja, psiquiatra que dirige un programa para estudiar el estrés traumático en el NIMH. Por ejemplo, los estudios de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud recién financiados que analizan pacientes con ‘long covid’ también incluirán un análisis sobre las enfermedades mentales en estos pacientes.

«Uno de los desafíos de esta pandemia es lo generalizada que está», dijo Borja a CNN. «Cuando se trata de toda la población de EE.UU. con un sistema de atención médica que ya está algo al máximo de su capacidad, hay muchas personas que padecen enfermedades mentales y nunca recibieron atención».

Una estrategia clave para llegar a las personas con estrés postraumático post-covid debe ser la divulgación y la detección selectiva, dijo Borja. Un ejemplo que podría adaptarse a otros grupos de alto riesgo es la Heroes Health Initiative, que fue lanzada en junio de 2020 por el Instituto para el Trauma y la Recuperación de la Universidad de Carolina del Norte, Chapel Hill, financiada por la Fundación Rockefeller.

La iniciativa utiliza una aplicación gratuita, la aplicación Heroes Health (que traduce Salud de Héroes), que ofrece a los trabajadores de la salud una encuesta semanal que analiza los síntomas de salud mental y conecta a los usuarios con un trabajador de salud mental si es necesario.

«De esta manera, el programa ha vinculado a cientos de trabajadores de la salud para brindar apoyo y atención», dijo a CNN el Dr. Sam McLean, director del instituto.

El uso de medidas de detección como esta para grupos que se han identificado como de mayor riesgo, como aquellos con síntomas persistentes de covid-19, podría ser una estrategia clave para adelantarse a esta crisis de salud mental que se avecina.

«Cuanto antes se pueda conectar a las personas para recibir atención y obtener una buena atención basada en la evidencia, más rápido se estará previniendo una vida de sufrimiento que tiene todo tipo de consecuencias para la persona», dijo Borja.

Y es importante que abordemos este problema ahora, porque, debido al estigma, la cantidad de sobrevivientes de covid-19 con estrés postraumático podría ser mucho mayor de lo que la gente piensa, dijo Brenner.

«Tienen miedo de ser etiquetados. Creo que para ellos es una nueva constelación de síntomas de los que están totalmente asustados y totalmente avergonzados. Creo que es mucho más difícil para ellos aceptar que hay un componente psicológico en esto y no solo un componente físico».",2021-04-02 00:00:00

(CNN) — Las momias antiguas de los faraones reales de Egipto emergerán de sus lugares de descanso este fin de semana y desfilarán por las calles de El Cairo en busca de un nuevo hogar.

Lo que suena como la trama de una película es, de hecho, parte de una fastuosa celebración de la historia de Egipto y un proyecto para trasladar algunos de sus mayores tesoros a una nueva instalación de alta tecnología.

El sábado, las momias de Ramsés el Grande y 21 de sus compañeros faraones participarán en lo que se anuncia como «El desfile dorado del Faraón», un evento muy esperado organizado por el Ministerio de Turismo y Antigüedades de Egipto.

Se informa que las celebraciones incluirán carros tirados por caballos, coros cantando en idiomas antiguos y una plétora de estrellas de cine y dignatarios, pero las autoridades egipcias han mantenido los detalles oficiales del evento bajo llave.

«Es una sorpresa», dijo a CNN Ahmed Ghoneim, director ejecutivo del Museo Nacional de la Civilización Egipcia, la institución que será el lugar de descanso final de las momias.

publicidad

Sin embargo, es difícil mantener un evento de esta magnitud como una sorpresa, especialmente cuando recientemente se llevaron a cabo ensayos generales en el centro de El Cairo. Los egipcios emocionados tomaron fotos de vehículos de momias hechos a medida adornados con motivos antiguos dorados y las subieron rápidamente a las redes sociales.

El viaje final de las momias de Egipto

El objetivo del desfile es trasladar a los 18 reyes y cuatro reinas de Egipto, junto con sus ataúdes y pertenencias, de su antiguo hogar en el Museo Egipcio.

Serán transportados cinco kilómetros al sur, a su nuevo lugar de descanso de alta tecnología en el Museo Nacional de la Civilización Egipcia (NMEC).

No, no es el enorme Gran Museo Egipcio de Giza, que también se abrirá al público a finales de este año. El NMEC es un museo completamente diferente en el barrio Fustat de El Cairo que completará un trío de museos de temática egipcia imperdibles en El Cairo y sus alrededores.

Aunque el NMEC tuvo una apertura parcial en 2017, el desfile significará la gran inauguración.

«Es una inauguración presidencial», dice Ghoneim. Y la finalización del Salón de las Momias Reales, que parece ser una experiencia de museo única.

«La idea no son las momias, la idea es cómo exhibes las momias … Es cómo cuentas la historia, es el ambiente, es el ambiente que sientes cuando entras», agregó.

Ghoneim dice que los visitantes que entren al Salón de las Momias Reales experimentarán algo parecido a entrar en una tumba en el Valle de los Reyes.

Las 22 momias reales son del Imperio Nuevo, una era en la que las tumbas se construían bajo tierra con entradas ocultas para protegerlas de los ladrones de tumbas. Un mundo aparte, y unos 600 años, de sus extravagantes contrapartes reales del Imperio Antiguo que construyeron colosales tumbas piramidales.

Preparando las momias

El Dr. Mostafa Ismail, jefe de conservación del Laboratorio de Conservación de Momias y Almacén del NMEC, dirigió un equipo de 48 personas para preparar las momias reales.

El proceso de conservación, le dijo a CNN, implica colocar cada momia en una cápsula de nitrógeno libre de oxígeno «que puede mantenerla preservada sin ser dañada por los efectos de la humedad, especialmente estamos hablando de bacterias, hongos e insectos».

La cápsula está rodeada de material blando que distribuye la presión y reduce las vibraciones durante el transporte.

Cuando las momias lleguen al NMEC, las unidades de exhibición tendrán exactamente las mismas condiciones que las cápsulas de nitrógeno. «Así que no habrá ningún shock para la momia cuando la saquemos de la caja y la coloquemos en estas unidades», agrega Ismail.

Acompañando a cada momia estarán las pertenencias descubiertas junto a ellas, incluidos sus ataúdes.

Las pantallas también mostrarán tomografías computarizadas que revelan lo que hay debajo de las envolturas y, a veces, cualquier fractura en los huesos o enfermedades que afligieron a la realeza.

«Lo principal que queremos que los visitantes sepan sobre estas momias es cómo han sido momificadas y preservadas durante mucho tiempo», explicó.

Cuando se le preguntó si su equipo descubrió algo nuevo sobre las momias al prepararlas para la mudanza, Ismail comentó: «muchas cosas», pero ninguna que revelaría antes del desfile. Así que hay más sorpresas por delante.

Un nuevo centro cultural en El Cairo

Sin duda el Salón de las Momias Reales será la atracción estrella para los visitantes del Museo Nacional de la Civilización Egipcia, pero el director ejecutivo Ahmed Ghoneim espera posicionar el museo de manera diferente a sus instituciones vecinas.

«No me estoy enfocando en la era faraónica como la mayoría de la gente pensaría», dice. «La mayoría de los egipcios y no egipcios, cada vez que van a un museo egipcio, piensan que van a ver a los faraones», explica. «Aquí me estoy estableciendo de manera diferente, estoy contando una historia diferente, atravesando la historia y llegando hasta el presente».

La primera exposición temporal se centrará en los textiles y la moda egipcia. «Toda la historia, desde las alfombras hasta la ropa», dice Ghoneim.

A través de las exposiciones, el museo contará una historia más rica de los logros de la civilización egipcia. Pero el museo también será un centro cultural.

«Un lugar que ofrece de todo, en parte educativo, en parte cultural, en parte de diversión, en parte comedor nocturno, etc. Es algo que es único», afirma.

Y por fin, 3.234 años después de su muerte, Ramsés II finalmente podrá ser enterrado.

El museo estará abierto al público el día después del desfile, el 4 de abril. El Salón de las Momias Reales se abrirá dos semanas después, el 18 de abril. El desfile del faraón se transmitirá en vivo en el canal de YouTube del Ministerio de Turismo y Antigüedades.",2021-04-02 00:00:00

(CNN Español) — Al honrar a mujeres muy especiales durante estos días que celebramos en todo el mundo los logros femeninos, quisiera recordar que hace 35 años –el 6 de marzo de 1986– murió la genial pintora estadounidense Georgia O’Keeffe. Tenía 98 años y había vivido a su aire, a su estilo y pintando lo que le gustaba y le producía curiosidad.



Su trabajo es considerado pionero en el arte estadounidense y, por ello, Georgia recibió muchos premios en vida, incluyendo las prestigiosas Medalla de la Libertad y Medalla Nacional de las Artes de Estados Unidos.

A mí me encantan sus flores –y el estilo tan especial en que las pintaba–, ¡aunque una de sus obras preferidas es su visión de las nubes desde un avión! ¡Y, cuando vuelo, retrato mucho las nubes y el cielo, inspirada por ella! Sus paisajes del desierto y las montañas de Nuevo México plasman su gran admiración por la naturaleza que le rodeaba.

Su mundo en Santa Fe, Nuevo México –donde vivió desde 1949–, era fascinante, aunque muchos artistas no hubieran seguido sus pasos a sitios tan duros y desérticos a comienzos del siglo XX. Pero era un hábitat que a ella, sin embargo, inspiraba –y donde vivió largos años–. Se enamoró de las montañas: «Es mi montaña privada, me pertenece, Dios me dijo que si la pintaba suficiente, podía quedármela”, dijo una vez para explicar su amor por el paisaje de Nuevo México. Curiosamente, sus orígenes habían sido muy diferentes y muy bucólicos –creció siendo la hija de un exitoso granjero que criaba vacas en Wisconsin-, algo usual para descendientes de inmigrantes europeos en el siglo XIX.

La artista desarrolló su amor por la pintura en Manhattan –donde el mundo artístico estaba floreciendo con gran éxito–. Y allí conoció al que sería su marido, el fabuloso fotógrafo Alfred Stieglitz. O’Keeffe era una mujer privadísima, disciplinada –que respetaba la naturaleza– e impartía clases de arte (durante varios años antes de llegar a Nueva York). “Para crear un mundo propio se necesita coraje”, decía.

O’Keeffe –a quien le molestaba el machismo que siempre atribuía a sus pinturas, connotaciones y freudianos símbolos sexuales– perdió parcialmente la vista debido a degeneración macular, y desde 1971 solo tenía visión lateral.

Después de radicarse en el Oeste estadounidense, nunca más quiso volver a vivir en Nueva York –donde había pintado rascacielos y puentes– y vivió con su esposo, el brillante Stieglitz, de quien se enamoró “a primera vista”. La muerte de Stieglitz en 1946 –después de 22 años de casados– provocó su mudanza permanente a Santa Fe.

Nuevo plan de Biden es un gasto mal enfocado (Opinión),"Esto incluye el plan de infraestructura de Biden 0:50

Nota del editor: Carrie Sheffield es miembro senior del Foro de Mujeres Independientes. Las opiniones expresadas en este comentario pertenecen exclusivamente a la autora. Ver más opiniones en CNN.

(CNN) — Este miércoles el presidente Joe Biden presentó su inmenso plan de infraestructura, su esfuerzo más reciente por expandir la influencia del gobierno sobre la economía de Estados Unidos, en el que expone un gasto en dos partes que hará crecer nuestra deuda nacional, nos hará menos competitivos con otros países y probablemente llevará a la pérdida de puestos de trabajo entre los estadounidenses de clase trabajadora.

Es difícil ver cómo este plan, que se promociona como el Plan de Empleo Estadounidense, ayuda a una economía que sigue tratando de salir de un agujero inducido por el covid, especialmente cuando llega menos de un mes después de que el Congreso aprobó un proyecto de ley de gasto de US$ 1,9 billones que no estaba tan bien diseñado como debería para ayudar a los más necesitados: los desempleados y aquellos cuyos salarios fueron recortados. Y esto es especialmente impactante porque hay pocas pruebas que sugieran que los anteriores paquetes de estímulo hayan funcionado de forma eficiente, ya que la Oficina Presupuestaria del Congreso (CBO, por sus siglas en inglés) estimó que sólo el 60% de los cheques de estímulo de US$ 1.200 del año pasado generarían actividad económica. Mientras tanto, un estudio sobre el estímulo de la primavera de 2020 realizado por la Oficina Nacional de Economía descubrió que más del 80% de los beneficiarios del estímulo ahorraron el dinero o lo utilizaron para pagar deudas, «y sólo un 15% declaró haberlo gastado en su mayor parte».

Ahorrar y pagar las deudas es algo que vale la pena, pero no impulsa el crecimiento económico. Es mejor que los estadounidenses ganen más dinero en los trabajos existentes en lugar de vivir de las generaciones futuras. Por lo que sabemos hasta ahora del nuevo plan de Biden, parece una bolsa de proyectos de gasto sin límites, lejos de atender a los más afectados por la pandemia.

Como informó CNN, una parte del plan pretende invertir en «la fabricación nacional, la investigación y el desarrollo, la economía asistencial, la infraestructura climática y las carreteras, los puentes y vías férreas» y una segunda parte en «las guarderías, incapacidad pagada por maternidad, atención médica e infraestructura educativa».

La Casa Blanca dice que quiere pagar el plan elevando el impuesto de sociedades del 21% actual al 28%, aumentando el impuesto mínimo global, acabando con las subvenciones federales a los combustibles fósiles y añadiendo la obligación de que las empresas multinacionales paguen la tasa tributaria estadounidense. Sin embargo, la experiencia demuestra que la introducción de nuevos impuestos acaba con la creación de empleo, justo en un momento en el que la competitividad de Estados Unidos es frágil, especialmente en la carrera con China.

Un análisis realizado en febrero por la Tax Foundation concluyó que aumentar la tasa federal del impuesto de sociedades al 28% elevaría a un 32.34% la tasa impositiva combinada federal-estatal de Estados Unidos, convirtiéndola en la más alta de la OCDE y de los países del Grupo de los Siete (G7). La CBO ha señalado que el aumento del impuesto de sociedades disminuye los salarios de los trabajadores y hace que Estados Unidos sea menos atractivo en comparación con otros países. La Tax Foundation también estimó que el alza de Biden reduciría la producción económica a largo plazo en un 0,8%, eliminaría 159.000 puestos de trabajo y recortaría los salarios globales en un 0,7%.

Pero lo peor es que con la contracción económica los más vulnerables son los más golpeados, ya que la Tax Foundation estima que «el 20 por ciento más bajo de los asalariados vería en promedio una caída del 1,45 por ciento en los ingresos después de impuestos en el largo plazo». Como señalé en diciembre de 2019 (justo antes de que la pandemia golpeara) los recortes de impuestos liderados por los republicanos aprobados en 2017 y la reforma regulatoria ayudaron a estimular el crecimiento récord del empleo, la riqueza de los hogares y el empleo para los estadounidenses negros.

Una parte importante del paquete de Biden es el gasto en infraestructuras, y aunque algunos ingenieros civiles abogan por un nuevo gasto en este sentido, algunos economistas cuestionan el impacto económico general del gasto en infraestructuras. ¿Por qué tomar decisiones de gasto tan grandes en este momento, en lugar de iniciativas más centradas en ayudar a los barrios más pobres? Especialmente cuando el covid-19 ha empezado a rediseñar el mapa demográfico de Estados Unidos, lo que hace que las futuras necesidades de infraestructuras cambien, ya que el Pew señala que en 16 estados se produjo un descenso de la población el año pasado, con flujos migratorios fuera de estados como California, Nueva York e Illinois y hacia estados como Texas y Florida.

En resumen: el nuevo plan de Biden es un derroche mal enfocado que necesita una revisión importante para ayudar a los más necesitados.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
México vuelve a comprometerse a realizar el trabajo sucio que le exige Estados Unidos,"Migrantes de Centroamérica esperan transporte en Penitas, Texas, el 12 de marzo Adrees Latif / Reuters

Nota del editor: Jorge G. Castañeda es colaborador de CNN. Fue seretario de Relaciones Exteriores de México de 2000 a 2003. Actualmente es profesor de la Universidad de Nueva York y su libro más reciente, “America Through Foreign Eyes”, fue publicado por Oxford University Press en 2020.

(CNN Español) — A principios de esta semana llegaron a México las primeras dosis de vacunas “prestadas” por el presidente Joe Biden a su colega Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Un millón y medio de vacunas de AstraZeneca fueron enviadas por avión desde Estados Unidos; se trata de un cargamento inicial que será complementado por otro, más adelante, de un millón de dosis adicionales. Es el resultado de un acuerdo entre los dos gobiernos anunciado el 19 de marzo, el mismo día que también se hicieron públicas una serie de decisiones de las autoridades mexicanas en materia migratoria.

Estas medidas incluyeron, entre otras, el cierre de la frontera entre México y Guatemala para todo tránsito de personas “no esenciales”; el envío de aún más militares y policías mexicanos al sureste del país para impedir el paso de los migrantes; una mayor disposición de México a aceptar de nuevo a menores centroamericanos no acompañados o en familia en instalaciones del Instituto Nacional de Migración (a pesar de una nueva ley que lo prohíbe); y, en general, una cooperación más estrecha entre ambos países para detener el flujo centroamericano.

Voceros de los dos gobiernos se apresuraron a afirmar que no se trataba de un quid pro quo: vacunas por centroamericanos. Pero para el de Estados Unidos fue más difícil negar lo obvio –los medios estadounidenses insistieron en subrayarlo, aunque en México no fue el caso–. Pronto surgieron interrogantes viejas, de la época de Trump, o nuevas. Los 8.000 militares y policías ¿se sumaban a los otros 25.000 que siempre citaba el expresidente Trump como el apoyo que le brindó AMLO? ¿Ya habían sido retirados aquellos? ¿Cuándo y por qué? Biden reveló en su conferencia de prensa de la semana pasada que México se negaba a recibir a los menores que no fueran mexicanos, acompañados o no, pero que se seguía negociando; ¿ha sucedido algo? ¿Qué haría México para detener el flujo de mexicanos, que constituyeron el 60% de los detenidos por las autoridades estadounidenses en noviembre, diciembre, enero y febrero?

En cuanto a las vacunas, también surgen dudas. En primer lugar, para un país de 126 millones de habitantes, 2,5 millones de dosis es una bicoca. En segundo término, aflora un gran número de cuestionamientos sobre la vacuna de AstraZeneca en todo el mundo, empezando por el propio Estados Unidos, cuyo regulador, la Administración de Medicamentos y Alimentos, no ha aprobado ni siquiera el uso de emergencia. Parecía que Biden le enviaba a López Obrador las dosis de una vacuna no está aprobada en su país (aunque sí en México) y que su propio gobierno se resistía a aplicar.

publicidad

Más de estas interrogantes y del carácter inmoral -o en el mejor de los casos, transaccional- del cambalache, es evidente que esta primera negociación entre el nuevo Gobierno estadounidense y el de México arrojó resultados ambivalentes. Por un lado, López Obrador obtuvo lo que más le urgía, a saber, un número pequeño, pero no insignificante de vacunas, en un corto plazo. En vista de la extrema lentitud del proceso de vacunación en México y de las enormes dificultades que el Gobierno mexicano ha experimentado para conseguir dosis de cualquier tipo, no es poco. No obstante, México vuelve a comprometerse a realizar el trabajo sucio que le exige Estados Unidos, con mayor amabilidad que antes, pero trabajo sucio al fin. En algún momento, seguramente, veremos proliferar de nuevo los campamentos y hacinamientos de migrantes en condiciones abominables del lado mexicano de la frontera entre ambos países. Asimismo, al vigorizarse de nuevo el patrullaje en la frontera sur mexicana, reaparecerán como siempre sus secuelas acompañantes: más corrupción, más extorsiones a migrantes, más violaciones de derechos humanos.

MIRA: Trabaja todo el día para ganar apenas US$2 y ahora piensa en sumarse a la caravana de migrantes

Para Washington, el arreglo permite esperar un relativo, pero innegable aumento en la cooperación mexicana para controlar la migración centroamericana, y limitar el daño en la imagen y en las encuestas que la llamada crisis migratoria le ha infligido a Biden. El costo es prácticamente nulo, ya que 2,5 millones de vacunas son apenas lo que Estados Unidos aplica en un día, y hoy dispone de un inventario enorme de antígenos. El problema es otro.

Biden y López Obrador no han disfrutado de una buena relación. En julio de 2020 el mandatario mexicano visitó a Donald Trump en la Casa Blanca en lo que fue visto por muchos como un espaldarazo a su campaña de reelección. AMLO fue uno de los últimos líderes mundiales en felicitar a Biden por su victoria, y uno de los últimos en condenar la insurrección en el Capitolio el 6 de enero. En vista de que ambos velan por los intereses de sus respectivos países tal y como los entienden, su relación ha tendido a normalizarse. Pero es delicada. Biden sabe que necesita a López Obrador para el tema inmigratorio, y que no puede permitirse el lujo de hacer cualquier cosa que lo irrite.

Al verse obligado a ser amistoso, Biden renuncia en los hechos a proceder de la manera más eficaz para atender el problema de fondo: la creciente migración mexicana, de varones solteros mayores de edad, provocada por el derrumbe de la economía mexicana, por la violencia generalizada en México, por la pandemia misma y por el inminente boom económico estadounidense. Buena parte de estos factores es el producto directo de las decisiones desastrosas de López Obrador, tanto en política macroeconómica como de salud y de repetidas burlas al estado de derecho. Solo Biden le puede pedir que cambie su rumbo. Pero eso irritaría sin medida a López Obrador, induciéndolo tal vez a dejar pasar a los centroamericanos. Biden no puede correr ese riesgo, pero tampoco puede hacerse de la vista gorda ante el descalabro mexicano.

Posponer cualquier advertencia a AMLO es posponer soluciones a los verdaderos problemas. Actuar ahora entraña correr el riesgo de que cualquier intento de convencer a López Obrador pueda fracasar, resultar contraproducente o provocar una reacción inesperada.

Pobre Biden, tan lejos de una solución inmigratoria y tan cerca de López Obrador.",2021-04-02 00:00:00

La guerra que se perdió de antemano,"Nota del editor: Camilo Egaña es el conductor de Camilo. Las opiniones expresadas en este artículo son exclusivas del autor.

(CNN Español) — Los muertos que uno quiere se resisten a irse.

Aparecen demasiado temprano para ser tarde y demasiado tarde para ser temprano. Pero siempre aparecen, tercos y con las pupilas muy dilatadas: en el fondo de una gaveta, en una fotografía que alguna vez sirvió de marcador, en un acorde de Lenon y McCartney y hasta en el olor de los plátanos fritos.

A los muertos que uno quiere se les echa tanto de menos, que si no nos llamamos al orden, empezamos a morir con ellos.

La pandemia y la desidia han matado en el mundo a más de 2 millones y medio de seres humanos.

Y solo en Estados Unidos, a más de 550.000. En el país más poderoso del planeta.

Estados Unidos carga con el mayor número de muertos del mundo a causa del coronavirus.

En poco más de un año, en esta nación han muerto más personas que en el campo de batalla de las dos guerras malditas y mundiales y en esa guerra que jamás se pudo justificar: la de Vietnam.

García Márquez decía que la muerte es injusta. Y lo es siempre. En esta pandemia la muerte se ha cebado en las comunidades hispanas y negras de EE.UU. y en las indígenas en varios países latinoamericanos.

Se apoderó de las viviendas abarrotadas en las que viven, persiguió a los más pobres que no podían dejar de trabajar o de buscar trabajo en los peores momentos de la pandemia. Para ellos quedarse en casa era un lujo o una extravagancia impensable.

¿Cómo fue realmente la guerra contra el covid-19 en la Casa Blanca de Trump?

Un nuevo documental durante esa administración.

Y lo que dijeron ha dejado al país sin aliento.

Uno de esos expertos es la doctora Deborah Birx, aquella señora que aparecía siempre con un pañuelo en el cuello y que no pudo disimular el hartazgo cuando en abril, Donald Trump sugirió ingerir o inyectarse lejía o desinfectante para eliminar el covid-19.

La doctora Birx ha dicho a CNN que tras la primera ola infecciosa del año pasado, que mató a unas 100.000 personas, el número de muertos podría haberse reducido sustancialmente.

Esta es la crónica de una guerra que se perdió de antemano, porque ni siquiera se declaró.

Quien podía y debía haberlo hecho estaba demasiado centrado en sí mismo y en su desdén por el uso de las mascarillas y la opinión de los expertos; en el recamo de sus virtudes, muy atento a los halagos cortesanos y negado a aceptar cualquier forma de crítica, por tibia que fuere.

Y cegado además, por su voluntad de superponer el cierre de caja – la entrada y salida del dinero nacional-, al bienestar público.

Estados Unidos merece una explicación.

Los que perdimos a gente muy querida merecemos una rendición de cuentas.

Aunque sepamos que es poco probable que eso ocurra.

Aunque sepamos que aquella fue una guerra que se perdió de antemano porque ni siquiera se declaró.

"Me vacuné, pero mi familia no y la culpa me está matando","Los países que lideran la vacunación en el mundo 0:57

Nota del editor: Melissa Mahtani es productora senior y reportera del equipo de noticias en vivo de CNN. Las opiniones expresadas en esta columna pertenecen exclusivamente a la autora. Lee más artículos de opinión en CNN.

(CNN) –– El sentimiento de culpa por la vacuna contra es algo real. Y, aunque no tenga sentido desde el punto de vista racional, las emociones no son racionales. El sábado pasado recibí la vacuna de Moderna contra el covid-19. Era elegible para recibirla bajo las disposiciones de la ciudad de Nueva York, debido a una enfermedad subyacente. Sin embargo, no estaba entre mis planes hacerlo.

Sí padezco condiciones preexistentes, pero las tengo bajo control. También estoy muy consciente de que hay otras personas ––maestros, trabajadores de la salud, adultos mayores de 60 años–– que la necesitan más que yo. A medida que aumentaba el número de personas en estos grupos que recibían la vacuna, mi plan era esperar hasta que todo el mundo pudiera vacunarse. Además, esperaba que mi familia en Zambia también recibiera la dosis en ese momento.

Perder a uno de los amigos más cercanos a nuestra la familia, al que considero mi tío, el mes pasado me impulsó a ponerme la vacuna. Originario de Yorkshire, Gran Bretaña, había vivido en Zambia durante la mayor parte de su vida, como muchos otros expatriados en la antigua colonia británica. Cuando él se contagió de coronavirus, ni siquiera el hecho de tener unos 80 años pudo asegurarle una cama en un hospital saturado y no lo admitieron. Eso hizo que sufriera un derrame cerebral y que, en última instancia, llegara a una unidad de cuidados intensivos, donde vivió sus últimos días, conectado a un respirador.

Si él hubiera estado en Gran Bretaña, o en cualquier otro país rico, probablemente habría recibido tratamiento inmediatamente, o habría recibido la vacuna. Y, posiblemente, seguiría vivo. La tragedia fue aún peor debido a que su familia y amigos no pudieron despedirse en persona debido a que tuvo covid-19. Al igual que muchos otros en todo el mundo que no han podido despedirse de sus seres queridos.

publicidad

Perderlo fue difícil. Entender que pudo ser el caso de mis padres y que no podría verlos ni despedirme de ellos si se contagiaran del virus fue peor. A miles de kilómetros de distancia, ¿los habría visto por última vez? Ese pensamiento tan inquietante me hizo comprender que debía ponerme la vacuna que me ofrecían aquí. Así podría estar más cerca de ver a mis padres en caso de que ocurriera una emergencia. Sin embargo, de todas manera, me sentí culpable por poder vacunarme cuando ellos, que la necesitan más que yo debido a su edad y a sus graves patologías subyacentes, no podían hacerlo.

Mi esposo pidió la cita para que yo recibiera la primera dosis e inmediatamente lloré. Sentía que estaba siendo egoísta. De camino a la cita, estaba angustiada por el hecho de que vivimos en un mundo tan injusto, en el que alguien como yo puede vacunarse y miles de personas no, y puede que no tengan acceso a ella durante mucho tiempo. No me malinterpreten. ¿Estoy agradecida por haberme vacunado? Por supuesto que sí. Todo el mundo debe vacunarse. Mi único deseo es que todo el mundo pueda hacerlo.

Mientras mi familia estaba feliz por mí ––incluso abrieron una botella de vino especial para celebrarlo–– yo lloraba de culpa. Mientras, me invadía la sensación de que, de alguna manera, yo había sido elegida para vivir y ellos no. Sé que eso no tiene sentido, pero pese a estar un paso más cerca de poder verlos, sentí y sigo sintiendo que, cierta forma, no los volveré a ver. Racionalmente entiendo que eso no es cierto, pero no puedo quitarme esa sensación. Daría cualquier cosa por poder renunciar a mi dosis para que ellos la recibieran. Me siento tan triste y culpable porque yo puedo vacunarme y ellos no. Lo peor es no saber cuándo podrán hacerlo.

Según Our World in Data, actualmente hay 67 naciones en el mundo que no tienen acceso, en absoluto, a las vacunas. ¿No cuentan sus ciudadanos? ¿No cuenta acaso cada vida humana? ¿Qué hace que mi vida sea más valiosa que la de ellos? ¿Por qué todas las empresas farmacéuticas no se esfuerzan por vacunar a todas las vidas del planeta Tierra contra una enfermedad que ha demostrado que puede infectar a cualquiera, independientemente de su ciudadanía, edad, raza o estatus social? ¿No debería ser igual de amplio el tratamiento del virus? Nadie en el mundo puede estar a salvo cuando hay otros en riesgo de contraer y propagar el virus. ¿No nos enseñó justamente eso la pandemia mundial?

El ritmo de la administración de vacunas depende en gran medida de las gigantes farmacéuticas. Estas empresas, respaldadas por los gobiernos que las financian, hasta ahora son reacias a compartir sus patentes. Lo que, señalan críticos, equivale a elegir el lucro por encima de la vida humana.

En cambio, han contribuido a un programa mundial para repartir vacunas llamado COVAX, que busca reducir la desigualdad en materia de vacunas. COVAX utiliza donaciones de gobiernos e instituciones multilaterales para comprar vacunas para las naciones más pobres que no pueden asumir contratos con las grandes farmacéuticas. Es un buen comienzo, pero obtener suficientes suministros ha sido complicado. En parte porque los países más ricos pidieron más de lo que necesitan.

Compartir las patentes podría ayudar. Como dijo recientemente Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, AstraZeneca es «la única empresa que se ha comprometido a no sacar provecho de su vacuna contra el covid-19 durante la pandemia». Y señaló la considerable contribución que ha hecho la empresa a la equidad de las vacunas, «al conceder licencias de su tecnología a varias otras compañías». Entre ellas, empresas de Corea e India que producen más del 90% de las vacunas distribuidas por COVAX.

La OMS pide destruir frascos de vacunas de covid-19 1:04

No estoy sugiriendo que compartir las patentes sea una varita mágica o que todos los países cuenten con la capacidad o las instalaciones para fabricar vacunas. Pero ante una pandemia mundial, todos deberíamos hacer el máximo esfuerzo para acabar con ella.

Aún así, a principios de este mes, los miembros más ricos de la Organización Mundial del Comercio (OMC) bloquearon un esfuerzo de más de 80 naciones en desarrollo que pretendía eliminar los derechos de patente para aumentar la producción de las vacunas contra el covid-19 para los países pobres. Ellos argumentan que mantener los derechos de propiedad intelectual fomenta la innovación. Thomas Cueni, director general de la Federación Internacional de Fabricantes de Productos Farmacéutico (IFPMA, por sus siglas en inglés), declaró a la agencia AP que levantar las protecciones sobre las patentes es «una muy mala señal para el futuro. Transmite la señal de que, si hay una pandemia, las patentes no valen nada».

No compartir los datos de las vacunas o no hacer más por compartir vacunas perjudica a los países ricos tanto como a los pobres. Como también señaló el Dr. Tedros: «Un enfoque egocéntrico puede servir a los intereses políticos a corto plazo. Pero es contraproducente y conducirá a una recuperación prolongada en la que el comercio y los viajes seguirán sufriendo… Mientras el virus se propague en cualquier lugar, tendrá más oportunidades de mutar y socavar potencialmente la eficacia de las vacunas en todas partes. Podríamos acabar de nuevo en el punto de partida».

Mientras nosotros, en Estados Unidos, recibimos nuestras vacunas, no podemos olvidar lo que nos llevó a este derecho de nacimiento. Estados Unidos, por ejemplo, es una tierra de inmigrantes. Eso significa que las personas nacidas aquí deben su libertad y su privilegio a otros que arriesgaron sus vidas para venir aquí, al igual que lo están haciendo ahora miles de personas en la frontera sur. ¿Dónde están las voces que dicen defender la vida para oponerse al aborto en crisis como esta? Atacan fervientemente el aborto, pero no los he oído alzar su voz con la misma fuerza por la muerte de sus compatriotas en otros países. ¿Acaso esas vidas no importan?

Irónicamente, una pandemia mundial que debería habernos hecho comprender que todos somos iguales, con las mismas preocupaciones y temores y susceptibilidad a las enfermedades, nos ha hecho quizás más egoístas, anteponiendo nuestros propios temores y los de nuestros seres queridos a nuestra preocupación por los desconocidos de todo el mundo. El amor y la preocupación que siento por mi familia en Zambia son tan valiosos como el amor y la preocupación que siente un estadounidense por su familia o un europeo por la suya.

Es necesario que cada persona se vacune para que todos estemos a salvo de manera colectiva. Hasta que eso ocurra, debemos seguir siendo considerados y compasivos. También reconocer nuestro propio privilegio de tener los recursos para protegernos de este virus. El covid-19 nos ha demostrado que no discrimina, y el antídoto tampoco debería hacerlo.",2021-03-31 00:00:00

Segunda vuelta en Ecuador: todos tienen un incentivo para impedir que Correa se salga con la suya,"Nota del editor: Carlos Alberto Montaner es escritor, periodista y colaborador de CNN. Sus columnas se publican en decenas de diarios de España, Estados Unidos y América Latina. Montaner es, además, vicepresidente de la Internacional Liberal. Las opiniones aquí expresadas son exclusivamente suyas.

(CNN Español) — En las elecciones de Ecuador hoy parece que ganará Andrés Arauz, el candidato elegido por Rafael Correa, pero no se sabe con total certeza. La segunda y última vuelta electoral será el 11 de abril. Hay encuestas para todos los gustos. Su contrincante es Guillermo Lasso, un banquero (Banco Guayaquil) que comenzó siendo un hombre pobre, muy católico, miembro del Opus Dei, en un país en el que la banca no tiene muy buena prensa, aunque la institución financiera de Lasso no ha sido manchada por ningún escándalo y se reconoce popularmente que él “se ha hecho a sí mismo”.



Arauz es un hombre joven que forma parte de la clase media alta. Estudió en la Universidad de Michigan, en Estados Unidos, y vivió también en Rusia, donde aprendió a tocar el piano. Está dotado para aprender idiomas. Habla inglés mucho mejor que Rafael Correa. Tiene apenas 36 años. Nació en Ecuador en 1985. En ese momento, Mijaíl Gorbachov llegaba al poder en la extinta URSS, y transcurría el segundo mandato de Ronald Reagan en EE.UU. Arauz presidía el Ministerio Coordinador de Conocimiento y Talento Humano hasta que Lenín Moreno disolvió aquel engendro, sospecho que por no entender lo que hacía, salvo gastar dinero de los contribuyentes al fisco.

MIRA: Gobierno de Ecuador admite que “no había plan de vacunación estructurado” contra el covid-19

Andrés Arauz no vivió, pues, la Guerra Fría, ni la angustia de vivir en un país acosado por La Habana. El jefe de los servicios de inteligencia cubanos en Ecuador, el oficial Enrique García, formado en Moscú, desertó en 1989, precisamente en Quito, y me contó el nivel de podredumbre de la clase política ecuatoriana. Según García, casi todos los grandes partidos, menos los socialcristianos, en algún momento habían recibido ayuda de La Habana.

Eso explica la confusión ideológica que reina en un país que puede votar por Abdalá Bucaram, a quien llamaban “El loco Bucaram” por sus excentricidades, o por una persona seleccionada por Rafael Correa, abanderado del «Socialismo del siglo XXI», quien está en las antípodas del personaje.

Hay dos electores principales que pueden darle la victoria a Guillermo Lasso.

MIRA: Debate presidencial en Ecuador eleva la temperatura para la segunda vuelta

El primero de ellos es Yaku Pérez, un ilustrado indígena, doctor en Derecho, que perdió la primera vuelta electoral por el 0,35%: votó por Pérez el 19,39% de los electores. Pérez no aceptó el apretado resultado frente a Lasso (19,74%) y salió a denunciar un supuesto fraude. Por ahora ha pedido a sus partidarios que no voten por Arauz o por Lasso, pero esa orden pudiera ser revocada.

El otro es el empresario Xavier Hervas de la Izquierda Democrática, quien perdió la primera vuelta el 7 de febrero tras obtener un total de 15,68% de los votos emitidos. Si se suman las votaciones de Lasso, Pérez y Hervas —quien ya ha dicho que personalmente respalda a Lasso— se obtiene un total de más de 54%, pero en política dos y dos no suman cuatro.

No obstante, todos tienen un incentivo para impedir que Correa se salga con la suya: impedir que su gente gobierne durante 50 años, como Arauz ha dicho imprudentemente y un periodista y político, Carlos Vera, lo ha reflejado oportunamente en su cuenta de Twitter. Ni a Yaku Pérez, ni a Xavier Hervas, y mucho menos a Guillermo Lasso, le interesa que el mismo rostro se instale en el Palacio de Carondelet durante medio siglo.",2021-03-25 00:00:00

"Supreme Court ruling could make it easier for Americans to receive more robocalls, watchdog group says","New York (CNN) Americans can expect to receive more cellphone robocalls and texts because of a US Supreme Court decision issued Thursday, according to a consumer advocacy group.

Facebook FB In a unanimous ruling that could have a major impact on telemarketing, the Supreme Court ruled thatcannot be sued for repeatedly texting customers security alerts because its texts didn't come from an autodialer.

The ruling comes six years after a Montana man sued Facebook to get the company to stop texting his cellphone telling him that an unauthorized person was accessing his Facebook account, court records show. Noah Duguid did not have a Facebook account and had never given the company his cell phone number, yet somehow it was in the company's database, according to his complaint.

The US Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Facebook cannot be sued for repeatedly texting the cellphone of a Montana man ""at all hours of the night"" because the texts and calls don't fit the current legal definition of an autodialer.

He kept receiving texts from the social media company even after he followed its instructions on how to stop the messages, he alleged. Duguid told CNN Business the texts only stopped after he filed his lawsuit.

The case hinged on the court's interpretation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, a 1991 law which protects US cell phone users from unwanted robocalls.

Uber ordered to pay $1.1 million after blind woman was denied rides more than a dozen times,"(CNN) Uber has been ordered to pay $1.1 million after an arbitrator ruled that the rideshare company's drivers discriminated against a blind woman and her guide dog on more than a dozen separate occasions.

Lisa Irving, a California resident, said she was denied rides or verbally abused by drivers 14 times in 2016 and 2018, Irving's attorney Adam Wolf told CNN.

She was awarded $324,000 in damages and more than $800,000 in attorney fees and court costs, according to the arbitrator's award posted online by her attorneys

The arbitrator rejected Uber's ( UBER ) argument that it was not responsible for its drivers' violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) because they are independent contractors.

""Whether its drivers are employees or independent contractors, Uber is nonetheless subject to the ADA as a result of its contractual relationship with its drivers,"" the award said

An Uber spokesperson said the company disagreed with the award and said its community guidelines prohibit drivers denying rides to passengers with service animals

""We are proud Uber's technology has helped people who are blind obtain rides and regret Ms. Irving's experience. Drivers using the Uber app are expected to serve riders with service animals and comply with accessibility and other laws, and we regularly provide education to drivers on that responsibility. Our dedicated team looks into each complaint and takes appropriate action,"" the company said in a statement.

In addition to being denied rides, Irving said some drivers who came to pick her up became verbally abusive towards her and her service dog Bernie, according to the award.

She alleged some rides she was denied led her to be late to work and ""contributed to her separation from her employer,"" according to the award.

Irving said she felt unsafe because of at least one driver's behavior, according to the award.

""[The driver] yelled at her to get out of his car at least fifteen times, at one point pulling over to demand she get out in a dangerous area, making her feel helpless by his intimidation and threats,"" the arbitrator wrote.

Irving filed complaints against the drivers with Uber, according to the award.

""Uber is liable for each of these incidents under the DOJ interpretation of the ADA as well as due to Uber's contractual supervision over its drivers and for its failure to prevent discrimination by properly training its workers,"" the award said.

Irving's attorneys filed a petition to affirm the award on Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court, according to a news release

""Of all Americans who should be liberated by the rideshare revolution, the blind and visually impaired are among those who stand to benefit the most. However, the track record of major rideshare services has been spotty at best and openly discriminatory at worst. The bottom line is that under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a guide dog should be able to go anywhere that a blind person can go,"" Irving's attorney Catherine Cabalo said in a statement.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Tesla temporarily halts production of its Model S and Model X,"New York (CNN Business) Tesla has not built any of its two most expensive cars -- the Model S and Model X -- so far this year.

Tesla did not respond to any questions for the reason for the production decision.

Even so, the automaker still managed to produce a record number of cars in its most recent quarter, as it built 180,338 of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV, both of which being less expensive models that made up nearly 90% of the company's overall sales in 2020. The total edged past Tesla's previous record set in the last three months of 2019 by nearly 600 cars.

Tesla actually sold slightly more vehicles to customers during the first three months of the year than it built, using vehicles it had in inventory at the end of of 2020. Its deliveries totaled 182,780 of the Model 3 and Model Y, and 2,020 of the Model S and Model X.

The Model S, which has an $80,000 starting price, was the first car Tesla ever completely assembled itself, starting production in 2012. The Model X debuted in 2015",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"Pandemic recovery picks up speed as employers add 916,000 jobs","New York (CNN Business) The US economy's recovery from the pandemic strengthened in March as employers added 916,000 jobs — the biggest gain since August, the Labor Department reported Friday.

The huge jump in jobs was up from the 468,000 increase in jobs reported for February, which itself was revised up by nearly 100,000 jobs from its initial reading.

The gain was also much better than predicted by economists, who expected a strong but more modest increase of 647,000 jobs.

Some of the sectors scoring big improvements were among those hurt the worst by the shutdowns associated with the pandemic, including restaurants and bars, which added 176,000 jobs.

State and local education jobs rose by 126,000 as schools started to reopen . Hotels and other accommodations added 40,000 jobs, and the category that includes performing arts, spectator sports and amusement parks added 64,000.

Travel is coming back. That's great news for airport stores,"New York (CNN Business) Stores and restaurants in airports have been slammed by the pandemic and the falloff in air travel. But travelers are beginning to fly again, offering airport stores signs of hope.

Airline travel in the United States recently reached its highest level since the pandemic began, although it's still around half of what it was pre-pandemic, according to the Transportation Security Administration. On Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that fully vaccinated people can resume trave l at low risk to themselves but that it still wasn't recommended at this time because of rising numbers of coronavirus cases.

The recent uptick in travel is helping stores like Hudson, one of the largest airport retailers in the United States. Hudson temporarily closed more than 700 of its more than 1,000 convenience stores in US airports last year during the height of the pandemic. As of March, 635 of them had reopened.

Hudson CEO Roger Fordyce said in an email that, where Hudson stores have reopened, travelers are spending more than they did before the pandemic.

The company recently opened Hudson Nonstop, a cashier-less store using Amazon's ""Just Walk Out"" technology, and plans to introduce the concept to new stores later this year.

More than 100 business leaders speak out against voting restrictions,"New York (CNN Business) Chief executives and other high-ranking leaders from more than 100 companies including Target, Snapchat and Uber issued a public statement Friday opposing any measures that deny eligible voters the right to cast ballots.

""We believe every American should have a voice in our democracy and that voting should be safe and accessible to all voters,"" the statement said. The companies are part of Civic Alliance, a coalition that ""recognizes that a strong democracy is good for business,"" according to its website.

The statement comes as businesses are under growing pressure to condemn legislation in Georgia, Texas, and other key states where Republican lawmakers are trying to clamp down on ballot access.

The Civic Alliance letter said its member companies ""stand in solidarity with voters"" and that Americans ""must have equal freedom to vote and elections must reflect the will of voters.""

The letter also blasted elected officials for passing or considering voting restrictions. ""Our elections are not improved when lawmakers impose barriers that result in longer lines at the polls or that reduce access to secure ballot dropboxes,"" the statement said.

"To prevent burnout, LinkedIn is giving its entire company the week off","The entire company is getting the time off as an opportunity to unplug, recharge and avoid burnout.

""We wanted to make sure we could give them something really valuable, and what we think is most valuable right now is time for all of us to collectively walk away,"" said Teuila Hanson, LinkedIn's chief people officer, who joined the company in June.

Since everyone is off at the same time, that means workers aren't inundated by emails, meeting notes and project requests piling up in their absence.

""You want the goodness of your vacation to last a little bit when you come back,"" Hanson said.

The week off extends to the majority of the company's 15,900 full-time employees. A core team of employees will continue to work for the week, but they will be able to schedule time off later.

The company started to operate remotely more than a year ago as the pandemic unfolded and has been surveying its workers regularly. Last summer, the surveys revealed a shift in employee sentiment.

""I think the reality of the weight of the pandemic really took its toll during those months. That was a heavy time. That is when we were seeing: 'wow there is clear burnout.'""

In response, the company created an initiative called LiftUp!, which includes burnout training for managers, no-meeting days and mental health resources.

CNN Business recently spoke with Hanson about how LinkedIn is fighting burnout and what its workforce might look like in a post-pandemic world. Here's what she had to say.

(This interview has been edited for clarity and length):

Have you seen signs of burnout among LinkedIn workers?

LinkedIn surveys employees quite often. We have a quarterly survey cadence and then we added additional surveys last year, just to make sure that we were really keeping a pulse on how employees were doing.

They added a simple open-ended question of just: How are you? That is when we started to see the emerging of themes in and around burnout, lack of self care, struggle with family, people feeling lonely or isolated, so that was really good to just be able to read through the verbatim comments and to really get some of that texture around how people are feeling, how they are doing, what they are missing, what they may be grieving.

Teuila Hanson joined LinkedIn in June as its chief people officer.

We would see in the comments that people missed a commute because they had the opportunity to sort of ramp up, listen to a podcast, listen to the news. They missed at the end of the day the ability to ramp down. And now that we have a good understanding of how our employees are feeling, how do we start to package some programs, communication, starting with our leadership team, our managers, so that we can begin to address these things.

Also, personally I put myself in that category. Starting a new job I was trying to fit everything I possibly could in my day, and then realized that I barely left the room that I was in. And I felt guilty because I have two sons... and I was missing out not being able to take the dog for a walk or be able to hang out with the kids. A lot of the comments that came through in our surveys, they definitely resonate with me as a parent [and] as somebody else who is missing the life that I had prior to the pandemic.

When did you start to notice a shift in employees' responses?

As we are measuring this quarter by quarter, definitely July, August, that was when the reality was setting in that this wasn't just a three-month thing. I think initially back in March folks just thought maybe by the summer this would pass, things might loosen up, and I think the reality of the weight of the pandemic really took its toll during those months. That was a heavy time. That is when we were seeing: 'wow there is clear burnout.'

The recent survey that we had, things are better, we had a [company-wide] shutdown at the end of the year the last week of December so we saw better results and better comments that people felt refreshed, they felt energized, and I think now that we have a vaccine and, at least in the United States and some other geographies, it looks like there is a path out of this, we are definitely hearing more positive sentiments from our employees. But it's up and down.

What did you do in response to the worsening survey data?

We looked at our survey results... the executive team put our heads together to figure out how could we systematically address these themes we are seeing with our employees. We worked with our benefits and employee experience team and came up with this program called LiftUp! It's a specific program to the pandemic and it really addressed those things that we heard through employee surveys. It was really intended to figure out, what can we specifically do from a program perspective -- benefits, perks to address burnout, work family balance, people feeling alone and isolated -- how could we bring some surprise and delight, how can we bring some levity to our employees?

We launched a series of workshops,""no-meeting days,"" specific programs for managers -- one program called compassionate accountability. Another course for managers: Keep calm and lead on. Another course around practical prioritization.

...what is really nice after a shutdown, you come back and you don't have a barrage of emails or meeting notes that you feel like you have catch up on..."" Teuila Hanson, LinkedIn's chief people officer

We also offered workshops to our employees, one workshop is called the ""necessity of no,"" so really empowering our employees in how to say no to their manager, how to make sure that their managers understand that they have a capacity and when their cups are filled or they're getting close to filled, how can employees have those types of conversations.

The no-meeting days are huge, very beloved. People felt like ""Wow, there is power to being able to just lock in and not run from Zoom meeting to Zoom meeting.""

Why give all employees a week off?

We thought that it would be a good thing for our entire organization to have another global paid week off. We have a global annual shutdown every December, many of our competitors also have a global shutdown at the end of the year.

We heard after our December shutdown that people felt energized, they felt like they were able to get outside, and felt able to do things like read books, watch webinars and watch movies. We thought, does it make sense for us to provide another paid week off, not only to address burnout and self care, but also show our gratitude to our employees? Because they are working hard, they are showing up and they are doing extraordinary work for us at LinkedIn. We wanted to make sure we could give them something really valuable, and what we think is most valuable right now is time for all of us to collectively walk away. And what is really nice after a shutdown, you come back and you don't have a barrage of emails or meeting notes that you feel like you have catch up on or you feel like you have to peek at your email.

You want the goodness of your vacation to last a little bit when you come back.

How will LinkedIn's workforce function in a post pandemic word?

We have definitely made decisions around ""hybrid flexible."" This has been a good learning experience of challenging long-held assumptions around how work can be done and where work can be done. So we've made a commitment that we are going to really lean into the concept of being a hybrid flexible work environment.

And for us that means all employees have the ability to work flexibility up to 50% of the time. We're really looking at it from a role by role perspective -- what does it mean for an employee to do their best work? That is going to give us a general idea of what this is going to look like in the future.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
'Decades overdue.' Transportation industry cheers Biden's infrastructure plan,"Washington, DC (CNN) President Biden's massive infrastructure proposal has excited transportation executives who say it is unprecedented and will have a broad, lasting impact on the country.

The outline calls for $621 billion to upgrade and modernize everything from roads to bridges, railways, buses, trains and airports. Electric vehicles are a major part of the proposal, with investments in charging infrastructure, the battery supply chain, manufacturing, tax incentives and job creation. An all-encompassing infrastructure push is a rarity, according to transportation experts.

""President Biden's plan is the most visionary proposal for the nation's transportation network since the dawn of the Interstate Highway System,"" Janette Sadik-Khan, chair of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, said in a statement.

The American Society of Civil Engineers has done report cards on US infrastructure since 1998, and the country has never received better than a C-, according to its chair emeritus Greg DiLoreto. He said Biden's proposal will avert negative economic consequences from a failing infrastructure.

""We have a proposal, finally, that may cut into the infrastructure shortfall,"" DiLoreto told CNN Business.

Paul P. Skoutelas, CEO of the American Public Transportation Association, said that in 40 years in the field, he's never heard a president talk more directly and forcefully on the importance of transportation investments.

""This is transformational for mobility,"" Skoutelas said. ""It's years, if not decades overdue.""

Biden's plan was especially cheered by companies pushing to electrify the US transportation fleet. Many described as the federal government's biggest push yet for electric vehicles. There are currently 41,155 electric vehicle charging stations in the United States, according to the US Department of Energy. Biden calls for investing $174 billion in electric vehicles, including a national network of 500,000 chargers.

He also called for replacing 50,000 diesel transit buses and at least 20% of school buses with electric vehicles.

Scott Mercer, founder of Volta Charging, which operates 1,700 charging stations, says that the federal government will need to be careful to focus not just on the quantity of electric vehicle charging stations, but the quality too.

He pointed to the charging networks of electric car makers Tesla and Rivian, which are exclusively for their own vehicles, as the kind of model that doesn't make the most sense for public investment.

""Imagine if Porsche were to go out and announce they were building gas stations for only Porsche 911 drivers. It doesn't make a lot of sense,"" Mercer said.

Rivian declined to comment, and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

Other companies have tried more open approaches, such as GM, which has a partnership with the EVgo, which has 800 public chargers in 34 states, and which says it is building 2,700 new fast-charging stations over the next five years.

Gabe Klein, a partner at the urban consulting firm CityFi, who previously led transportation departments in Chicago and Washington, DC, praised the Biden plan for having a holistic approach. He pointed to how the proposal calls for everything from electrifying school buses to building chargers for those buses, and nurturing a supply chain and manufacturing in the US to develop the buses.

""If we're going to save ourselves in this climate crisis, this is the level of investment we need,"" Klein said.

Racial equity is also a component of the proposal, which calls for $20 billion to reconnect neighborhoods historically divided by highways. Black neighborhoods were routinely targeted and bulldozed to make way for highways in the 20th century. The proposal was welcomed by Marvin Roger Anderson, who is leading an effort to redevelop Rondo, a St. Paul, Minnesota neighborhood that was destroyed to make way for Interstate 94.

""[This] would be an enormous step forward to help close the wealth gap and help communities of color,"" Anderson said.

But Biden's plan is not without critics. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, cautioned that the 28% corporate tax rate proposed to fund the plan could dissuade investment, and called the tax hike to fund the plan the largest in five decades.

""The president is proposing a behemoth tax and spending plan that centralizes more power in D.C.,"" said Matthew Dickerson, director of the foundation's work on the federal budget.

Nicole Gelinas, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, which focuses on urban policy, said that the investments in public transit and highway removal risked becoming overly expensive.

""Without cost reform, including a requirement that all construction contracts that benefit from federal funding be made available to the public, the danger is that more money simply inflates the cost of existing projects in terms of pushing up the cost of materials and labor,"" Gelinas said.",2021-04-01 00:00:00

""DoublePoint has amassed an impressive, high quality footprint in the Midland Basin,"" the eastern part of the Permian Basin, Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield said in a statement , adding that the deal ""will complement our unmatched position in the core of the Permian Basin.""

The deal will give Pioneer access to about 97,000 contiguous net acres of mostly undrilled land, bringing Pioneer's total position to more than 1 million net acres, the company said.

It expects the new acreage to be producing around 100,000 barrels of oil daily by late in the second quarter.

The 2022 GMC Hummer SUV is a large 830-horsepower electric family hauler,"(CNN) Last fall, when General Motors revealed the GMC Hummer EV electric pickup, Duncan Aldred, head of the Buick and GMC brands, told CNN Business, ""There will be an SUV, so watch this space.""

That space is now filled. GM revealed the GMC Hummer EV SUV on Saturday in a 60-second commercial narrated by LeBron James shown during the Houston-Baylor NCAA Final Four basketball game. A longer version of the commercial appears on the GMC.com website.

The GMC Hummer EV SUV is about nine inches shorter than the pickup version.

The Hummer EV pickup and SUV will be among the first vehicles from GM using a new electric vehicle battery system that will be the basis for dozens of new models over the coming years. General Motors recently announced it hopes to produce nothing but zero-emission vehicles by the year 2035

With these models, GM is entering the market with attention-grabbing, high-performance off-road vehicles that defy a common stereotypes of electric vehicles as slow and fit only for running errands around town. The approach is similar to that of Ford with the Mustang Mach-E. The Mach-E, a performance-oriented crossover SUV that went on sale late last year, has taken sales away from electric vehicle market leader Tesla

The Hummer EV SUV is smaller with a nine-inch shorter wheelbase (the distance from the front to the rear wheels) than the pickup, which should give it better off-road maneuverability. It will have not have the Hummer EV pickup's maximum available 1,000 horsepower, though.

"Rare Super Mario Bros. game sells for a record $660,000","(CNN) After being forgotten in a desk drawer for almost 35 years, a sealed copy of the Nintendo video game Super Mario Bros. sold at auction on Friday for a whopping $660,000.

It's the most ever paid for a video game, according to a news release from Heritage Auctions, which ran the sale.

The Dallas-based auction company said the NES cartridge was purchased as a Christmas gift in 1986, and was untouched until the seller found it earlier this year.

""It stayed in the bottom of my office desk this whole time since the day I bought it,"" said the unidentified seller in the release. ""I never thought anything about it.""

The unopened game was professionally graded by WataGames and had a score of 9.6/A+ , according to the news release, which called it ""the finest copy known to have been professionally graded for auction.""

It is also one of the earliest copies of the game to be shrink wrapped instead of having a sticker seal, according to the auction company.

This particular version of the game first went on sale in 1986, but Nintendo changed the packaging in early 1987, so only a relatively small number were sold.

""Since the production window for this copy and others like it was so short, finding another copy from this same production run in similar condition would be akin to looking for single drop of water in an ocean,"" said Valarie McLeckie, video games director for Heritage Auctions. ""Never say never, but there's a good chance it can't be done.""

It wasn't the only video game that brought in big money at the auction. A 1987 Mega Man cartridge sold for $144,000 and a buyer paid $102,000 for a copy of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! made the same year.

The $660,000 price includes the buyer's premium and shatters the previous record for a copy of Super Mario Bros. game.

A 1985 copy of the game sold for $114,000 last July, which at the time, was the most ever paid for a video game , according to Heritage, which also handled that sale.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
'Godzilla vs. Kong' could be the biggest hit of the pandemic,"New York (CNN Business) Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, Hollywood has kept a close eye on any movie that could give some insights into the film industry's potential renaissance or demise after the pandemic has abated.

Hollywood may now finally have that film. It stars a radioactive lizard and a giant ape that fight for roughly an hour and 53 minutes.

Warner Bros.' "" Godzilla vs. Kong "" hits domestic theaters on Wednesday. The film, which will also stream on HBO Max, is expected to make north of $20 million over the holiday weekend. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)

That would be a pretty lackluster result in regular times but it's enough to make the movie a potential monster hit, with one of the the biggest box office openings of the pandemic.

And with the pace of vaccinations ramping up, more big films returning to studios' schedules and in-person attendance at movie theaters growing, the film could be a harbinger of better times for the beleaguered theater industry.

""'Godzilla vs. Kong' is important both financially and symbolically for a movie theater industry that has been shaken to its core by the pandemic,"" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN Business. ""This weekend's debut provides a real-time opportunity to gauge consumer enthusiasm for a film that truly warrants a big-screen experience, while also being available at home just a click and a subscription away.""

""Godzilla vs. Kong"" vs. the pandemic

Two of film's greatest monsters duke it out this weekend in ""Godzilla vs. Kong.""

For Warner Bros., ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" already looks like a success.

The film opened last week in China, the top movie market in the world, and had a powerful debut there earning roughly $70 million.

Comscore SCOR It already has made more than $120 million at the global box office, a strong showing considering that the last film in Warner Bros.' ""MonsterVerse"" series was ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"" which made $394 million worldwide in 2019, according to

And that was before the pandemic.

The film's strong start in China can be seen as great news for theater owners in the US, who have struggled to find audiences to fill seats for more than a year.

Films like ""Tenet,"" ""The Croods: A New Age"" and ""Tom & Jerry"" were notable releases over the last year, but have brought in mixed results at a box office disrupted by the pandemic.

""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is arriving just as the tide seems to be turning for movie attendance. ""Hollywood needs more popcorn flicks in theaters if it wants to cultivate a revival,"" according to Jeff Bock, senior analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations.

""The return-to-form is a Catch-22 for the industry, as none of the big-budget releases thus far have met studio expectations in terms of overall grosses,"" Bock said. ""To resonate with general audiences, the film industry needs blockbuster content. Pure and simple.""

Warner Bros. is in a ""unique situation"" since it's releasing films theatrically and on streaming, he added, because it helps ""not only theater exhibition, but their own streaming growth."" The company announced in December that all of its 2021 films would be released in theaters and to HBO Max simultaneously.

""The monstrous opening [in China] last weekend certainly helped engage prospective audiences and helped continue to build buzz in North America where theaters have been open but struggling,"" Bock added. ""With another large opening weekend, it will be a clear signal to studios that audiences not only feel safe returning to theaters but will support blockbuster-sized offerings this summer.""

""A positive beacon for the industry""

Blockbusters like ""F9"" will be very important to the health of Hollywood this summer.

And this summer, even more so than most summers, is essential to Hollywood.

Disney DIS Blockbusters likeand Marvel's ""Black Widow,"" Universal's ""F9"" and Warner Bros.' ""The Suicide Squad"" are all set to open this summer. If the box office totals of those films, and others like them, are even somewhat sizable, it'll be a signal to Hollywood that moviegoing is moving in the right direction.

And it also would demonstrate that theaters and streaming can co-exist since some films this summer, such as "" Black Widow "" and ""The Suicide Squad,"" will be available on both platforms simultaneously.

It's still way too early to tell what the future will look like for an industry that just had one of its worst years ever. But if ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" can follow up its strong debut in China with a solid theatrical roll out in the US, it may prove to Hollywood that there's some roar left at the cineplex.

""The summer movie season, for obvious reasons, was virtually non-existent in 2020, and though the summer of 2021 may get off to a late start there is cause for optimism,"" Dergarabedian said. He noted, however, that vaccinations are key to the restoration of both consumer and studio confidence.

""This summer movie season may turn out to be a positive beacon for the industry heading into the fall/holiday season, 2022 and even beyond,"" he said.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Goodbye empty middle seats. Delta is selling the whole plane starting May 1,"New York (CNN Business) The empty middle seat on airplanes, one of the few advantages of pandemic, is about to disappear.

, the last remaining US airline to keep middle seats unbooked, has lifted that prohibition as of May 1, the company announced Wednesday. It is another sign of a rebound in demand for air travel and greater willingness of people to resume pre-pandemic activities.

""As vaccinations become more widespread, consumer demand and behaviors show us that confidence in travel is on the rise and customers are ready to reclaim their lives,"" said Delta's statement Wednesday.

Airlines have insisted that even with the planes fully booked, measures they have taken during the pandemic have greatly reduced the threat of Covid-19 being spread among passengers. Those provisions include frequent exchange of fresh air in the cabin, enhanced cleaning measures and a requirement that passengers wear masks.

Expanded vaccine availability factored into Delta's decision. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the company's research shows that 64% of its pre-pandemic passenger base anticipate having at least dose of the vaccine by May 1.

""Don't confuse these actions with a return to 'normal,'"" said Bastian in a memo to employees Wednesday. ""We're still operating in a pandemic, and many of the changes we've made over the past year, such as strengthening our cleanliness protocols and eliminating change fees, will be permanent. Importantly, masks remain critical to our ability to safely welcome more people onboard our planes, and we remain committed to enforcing these requirements.""

Delta also announced Wednesday that the credits customers received for canceling flights last year, which were to expire after 12 months, have been extended through the end of 2022. The same is true of any tickets purchased in 2021 that were later canceled.

In the early days of the pandemic, when demand for flights ground to a near halt , all the airlines were keeping the middle seats open as a way to promote social distancing and increase customer confidence in flying. But most of the other airlines started filling the seats last summer.

Delta's move regarding middle seats is not a surprise given that the airline previously said it would keep the prohibition in place only through April 30. People booking flights on May 1 and later have already seen the middle seat available for seat selection on the Delta website.

The airline has not broken down the cost of keeping the seat open longer than other airlines.

""It's expensive. No question about it,"" Bastian told CNN's Poppy Harlow in February. But the cost of keeping the middle seat open is partly offset by higher fares that Delta has been able to charge, he added.

American Airlines AAL United UAL Southwest LUV The amount that Delta passengers paid on average for every mile traveled in the final three months of 2020 fell only 3% from the pre-pandemic period a year earlier. That's significantly better than that of the other three major US airlines --and-- whose fares declined between 15% and 19%.

""People are prioritizing, as they should, their health and safety and comfort as they travel,"" Bastian told CNN in February. ""And we're getting a meaningful premium for travel on Delta.""",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Silicon Valley is starting to bring workers back to the office,"San Francisco (CNN Business) After years of building huge modern offices and a work culture that many industries have emulated, Silicon Valley was among the first to shutter those offices and go fully remote when the coronavirus pandemic began.

Now, many of the tech industry's biggest companies are slowly making plans to bring workers back, offering a potential road map in the process for what office work looks like in year two of the pandemic.

On Monday,opened the doors of its new campus in San Francisco's Mission Bay, which it finished constructing during the pandemic. The office initially opened at 20% capacity, with employees allowed to return on a voluntary basis, and around 100 employees came in on Monday and Tuesday according to Uber spokesperson Lois Van Der Laan. The company currently has around 3,500 employees in the Bay Area.

Employees who choose to come back to the office are required to have a virtual ""boarding pass"" which they can get by signing an acknowledgment form detailing Covid-19 precautions, taking a daily health screening at home and reserving a spot in the office so Uber can control occupancy, she added. The majority of Uber workers can continue working from home until at least September 13.

is also planning to allow some workers back into its Silicon Valley offices in the next few weeks. The company will reopen certain Bay Area offices at 10% capacity starting in May, Facebook spokesperson Chloe Meyere told CNN Business.

""The health and safety of our employees and neighbors in the community is our top priority and we're taking a measured approach to reopening offices,"" Meyere said in a statement, adding that aside from physical distancing and mask requirements, Facebook will also mandate weekly coronavirus tests wherever possible for workers coming in.

Facebook employees also have the option of not returning to the office at all, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicting earlier this year that half of Facebook's workforce could be remote within the next decade. For those who need to come into the office, the company will allow them to work from home until a month after their nearest office opens at 50% capacity. Facebook says its largest offices likely won't allow 50% capacity until at least September 7 this year.

Twitter said it has not yet set a date for when employees can return to the office, but when it does it will only allow 20% capacity to start. The social media company told employees early on in the pandemic that they could work remotely ""forever"" if they so choose, but anticipates that a majority of workers will opt for a mixed or hybrid model once offices reopen, where they come in sometimes and work from home otherwise.

Google confirmed on Wednesday that it will start bringing US employees back to the office in April on a voluntary basis. Googlers will not have to return to the office until at least September, the company's previously stated deadline , after which Google has said it will start testing a flexible workweek where they come in only for three days.

Apple AAPL , which did not respond to a request for comment, reportedly started bringing employees back to its headquarters as early as May last year.

Microsoft MSFT Outside of Silicon Valley, began bringing some workers back to its headquarters and nearby offices in Redmond, Washington on Monday, in what it described as a ""hybrid workplace"" model.

The range of scenarios big tech companies are sifting through highlights just how much uncertainty remains around returning to the office, even as vaccinations pick up pace across the United States and around the world. The gradual reopening may also be the clearest test yet for the resiliency of the Bay Area market. Many Silicon Valley workers, taking advantage of flexible remote work policies, have decamped to other cities including Austin, Miami, Nashville and Denver. Several major companies, with Oracle and Hewlett-Packard Enterprises among the notable names, have also relocated.

""Every person at every company presents a unique and different situation,"" David Bergeron, president of tech-focused real estate firm T3 Advisors, told CNN Business. Bergeron says the appeal of remote work for companies is that they can attract a broader talent pool than their competitors, but it'll be a balancing act.

""The risk is if you try and fail at 'going remote' you could have an incredibly long and difficult road back earning the trust of current and future employees,"" he added.

But calling the end of Silicon Valley's dominance may be premature, and only time will tell how much of the exodus is permanent, particularly when the region's biggest firms fully reopen.

""The things that made Silicon Valley special are not going anywhere,"" Jim Breyer, one of the area's most prominent venture capitalists who recently moved to Austin, wrote in an op-ed for CNN Business earlier this month. ""The Bay Area will continue to be a global hub of innovation that attracts courageous entrepreneurs, benefits from world-class institutions and nurtures talent from leading tech companies — even as Austin offers a remarkable new frontier of opportunity,"" he added.

San Jose, one of Silicon Valley's biggest cities and home to companies such as Cisco, Adobe and PayPal, ranked top among 50 US cities for office development opportunities in a report last month by the real estate firm CBRE, in part because of a ""strong demand"" for office space and favorable construction costs.

Colliers, another real estate firm, said in a subsequent report that Silicon Valley ""proved to be more resilient than other technology markets"" during the pandemic, largely thanks to the ""wealth of established tech companies,"" including Google, Facebook and Apple. The region accounted for more than 40% of venture capital spending last year, according to the firm.

""The fundamentals of the Silicon Valley market remain strong and the market is well positioned to rebound from the pandemic more quickly than other areas, due to its high concentration of large technology companies and a healthy start-up community,"" Lena Tutko, senior research manager at Colliers Silicon Valley, said in a statement. ""Silicon Valley remains the epicenter of innovation.""",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Airbnb and Vrbo are overloaded with reservations,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here

New York (CNN Business) After a year of being cooped up at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, many Americans are taking a cue from 2021 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction nominee The Go-Go's.

""Vacation, all I ever wanted. Vacation, had to get away.""

People are hitting the roads and airports for Spring Break trips this coming week and are already starting to make plans for the summer. And that's good news for companies like Airbnb and its home sharing rival Vrbo, which is owned by online travel giant

Shares of Airbnb are up more than 20% this year following 2020's successful initial public offering , while Expedia has soared more than 30%.

Consumers clearly want to start taking trips again, especially as more adults are vaccinated.

""We've had a phenomenal recovery,"" said Vrbo president Jeff Hurst in an interview with CNN Business. ""We could be looking at a real boom period for leisure travel.""

A resurgence in vacations could lift all boats in the sector. Hurst, who also serves as Expedia's co-lead of marketing, said the company's numerous other brands, which include Hotels.com, Travelocity, Orbitz and Hotwire, are starting to bounce back too.

""More people are searching for core urban destinations that had a falling out during the pandemic. People are interested in going to Las Vegas again,"" Hurst said, adding that there is a certain degree of freedom that people who have already gotten coronavirus shots now feel.

""People will start booking more flights and hotels and resorts will have a big comeback,"" he said.

But there will be also some people that will want to drive a few hours to go to a rental house in the woods as opposed to flying to a beach or mountain resort and staying in a fancy hotel.

Hurst said Vrbo, which was founded in 1995 as Vacation Rentals By Owner, is off to its best start to a year in a quarter century in the United States, adding that people are also starting to book summer trips significantly earlier than usual.

Airbnb is booming too. The company said earlier this month ""that guests are increasingly looking for ways to safely reunite and meaningfully connect with loved ones"" and its hosts have earned a combined $1 billion since the start of the pandemic last year.

Austin, northern Arizona and — of course, the Places like southern Maine, the Jersey Shore, the suburbs ofAustin,northern Arizona and — of course, the beaches of Florida — are hot spots for travelers, according to Airbnb.

Vrbo's Hurst said that another trend he is seeing is the rise of the so-called ""flexcation."" More people are willing to go away for longer periods of time.

The increased work from home trend and availability of virtual schooling is making it more desirable for people to be away from home for several weeks ... or even months.

The jobs recovery may be gaining speed

The US jobs report is the big event on the calendar next week.

Investors will be looking to see if the economy can improve on the 379,000 jobs created in February. Figures for March will be published at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.

How will investors react? Well ... they won't. At least not right away. US markets will be closed for Good Friday, which is not a federal holiday.

The unemployment rate now stands at 6.2% compared to last April's peak of 14.7%. But there could be more improvement on Friday.

""With recent robust survey data pointing to upbeat business confidence, buoyed by the vaccine rollout and new $1.9 trillion stimulus measures, hiring is likely to have remained solid in March,"" said analysts at IHS Markit.

Capital Economics said the labor market recovery probably ""kicked into a higher gear"" in March, driven by a rebound in leisure and hospitality hiring as states including Texas lifted restrictions on businesses and restaurants.

""The continued rebound in the OpenTable restaurant dining data suggests the recovery in employment at bars and restaurants is gathering pace, consistent with overall leisure sector employment,"" senior US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a research note.

Capital Economics predicts that 700,000 jobs were added to the economy in March, which would be the best month since September.

5 big signs that travel is roaring back,"New York (CNN Business) Vacation deprivation is about to be replaced by a travel boom , according to Expedia CEO Peter Kern.

He told CNN's Julia Chatterley earlier this week that people are beginning to think about their future travel ""very quickly."" Reservations on the travel website for some parts of the United States this summer are ""all booked up"" and he expects Europe will soon follow as the number of vaccinations grow.

Of course, ""normalcy"" for the travel industry is still a long way off because of the lack of business travel and the continued closure of many international borders.And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still urging Americans — even those who have been vaccinated — not to travel.

But leisure travelers itching for a getaway have helped spur demand for US airlines, Airbnb and hotel chains.

Here are some major signs that there's a travel turnaround:

Air travel is soaring

American Airlines AAL United UAL Delta DAL JetBlue JBLU Executives fromandall said this week that they've seen strong demand for seats from leisure travelers. Bookings have been particularly strong during the traditional spring-break period and going into the summer.

""The last three weeks have been the best three weeks since the pandemic hit,"" American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said about advanced ticket sales. ""We're getting very close to 2019 levels in total bookings.""

JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes echoed the optimism, saying there's ""a lot of pent-up demand."" He added: ""As people are getting vaccinated, they're jumping on airplanes to see people they haven't seen in year.""

In a note to employees Thursday, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said it has ""seen positive momentum in recent weeks,"" adding that it could break even sometime soon. ""This gives me optimism that a return in demand is underway,"" he said.

TSA numbers are climbing

That demand is being reflected in data from the Transportation Security Administration.

Air travel is up from a year ago for the first time since the pandemic began. About 1.4 million people passed through US airport security checkpoints on Thursday, according to the TSA, up from the 780,000 who were screened on the same day last year.

More than 8.8 million people have flown in the last seven days, and more than 1 million people were screened each of the last eight days — the longest such stretch of the pandemic.

Still, Thursday's numbers are still at a heavily depressed level, because it's roughly 60% of the traffic the same day in pre-pandemic 2019.

Airbnb's top towns

Bookings for ""warm weather locales, small beach towns, and access to state and national parks"" are fueling Airbnb. The home-sharing website said this week that it's seeing more bookings because of ""pent-up travel dreams.""

Among the most-searched cities and regions on Airbnb are southern Maine, the Outer Banks in North Carolina, and Montana. The number of people searching for properties with outdoor spaces was 35 times higher compared with the same travel period a year ago.

Big deals

Extended Stay America STAY announced this week that it's being taken private in a $6 billion deal. It's the latest green shoot for the beleaguered hotel industry, which, to put it lightly, had a dismal 2020.

The budget-minded chain has about 650 hotels across the US. The company fared better last year compared with its competitors because it was attractive to traveling medical professionals and other essential workers who had to work during the pandemic.

Blackstone and Starwood Capital will evenly split the company, with the owners betting that the chain will continue to grow. A Starwood executive told The Wall Street Journal that they expect people in training programs, couples getting divorced or moving might stay at the hotel in the future.

Disneyland is finally reopening

Disneyland and its sister theme park California Adventure announced plans this week to reopen with limited capacity on April 30.

Disneyland is the Disney's flagship theme park located in Anaheim, California. It has been closed for more than a year because of the pandemic.

""It's the final sign that things are getting back to normal for the Disney company,"" Robert Niles, editor of ThemeParkInsider.com, told CNN Business of the reopening. ""Having Walt Disney's original park closed, even with the others being open, was still a reminder that something was amiss.""

For now, only California residents may visit the parks because of state health guidelines, the company said. Safety measures include mandatory masks for guests over the age of 2, social distancing and use of a new ticketing system to help manage capacity.

David's Bridal says weddings are coming back -- now with jumpsuits and short hems,"New York (CNN) Weddings across the country have been postponed or canceled in the pandemic, but couples are now signaling that they won't have their love locked down forever.

David's Bridal, one of largest seller of wedding gowns in the United States, said it's anticipating weddings to return with a vengeance this year and into 2022 because of pent-up demand.

Shorter hemlines are a popular trend in wedding dresses.

James Marcum, CEO of David's Bridal, said that based on the number and timing of dress orders the chain is getting, he expects the pace of weddings to be most robust in the fall, followed by next spring and summer. ""In terms of volume of weddings, we anticipate it to be up approximately 50% compared to an average year, pre-pandemic,"" he said.

In addition to the postponed weddings that will come to fruition this year, Marcum said many couples who proceeded with their nuptials in 2020 but opted for more intimate affairs, or ""minimonies,"" are planning to hold second larger celebrations.

""People are feeling a lot more comfortable and optimistic,"" he added. ""As vaccination rates pick up, we're seeing signs of heightened wedding-related activity.""

SpaceX Mars rocket prototype explodes during test flight,"Austin, Texas (CNN Business) An experimental SpaceX rocket exploded at the end of a high-altitude test flight Tuesday, but heavy fog at the site left even SpaceX at least publicly uncertain about exactly what caused the explosion.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk did confirm the explosion on Twitter , though, saying ""At least the crater is in the right place!""

Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent & didn't reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn't needed.



Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 30, 2021

All three of SpaceX's previous launches of prototypes for this model of rocket crash landed or exploded shortly after landing.

SpaceX engineer John Insprucker, who hosted a webcast of the test launch, said the rocket, known as SN11, had a normal ascent and that all appeared to be well before on-board cameras lost signal and the vehicle was subsumed by fog moments before landing. Insprucker said the company will share updates on social media once SpaceX engineers are able to check out the landing site. The area surrounding the vehicle must be cleared before liftoff for safety reasons.

Insprucker said the company is not expecting to recover video footage. ""Don't wait for landing,"" he advised webcast viewers.

Japanese billionaire invites 8 people to join SpaceX mission around the Moon,"Austin, Texas (CNN Business) Japanese fashion mogul Yusaku Maezawa, who first announced his intention in 2018 to take a group of artists with him on a six-day trip around the Moon, said Tuesday that he's inviting the public to apply to fill eight open seats on the mission now slated to take off in 2023.

Maezawa also said that he's decided to expand his definition of an ""artist,"" which he initially defined as singers, dancers, painters and other traditional creative fields. Now, he's open to including people from all walks of life as long as they view themselves as artists, Maezawa said in a video announcement Tuesday.

Maezawa's invitation to the public to join his Starship mission comes as another billionaire, Shift4 payment platform CEO Jared Isaacman, is searching for a member of the public to join him on a trip to orbit aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. That mission is slated for later this year and is aimed at raising money for St. Jude Children's Hospital

The website for ""Dear Moon,"" Maezawa's name for his space mission, now includes a link where applicants can pre-register through March 14. Initial screenings of the candidates will begin March 21.

There will be two main criteria for selection: Applicants should be seeking to ""push the envelope"" in their field of work by going to space ""to help other people and greater society in some way,"" and they should be willing to support their fellow crew members during the journey.

"SpaceX Mars prototype rocket nails landing for the first time, but explodes on pad","Austin, Texas (CNN Business) A SpaceX rocket prototype, known as SN10, soared over South Texas during test flight Wednesday before swooping down to a pinpoint landing near its launch site. Approximately three minutes after landing, however, multiple independent video feeds showed the rocket exploding on its landing pad.

SpaceX's SN10, an early prototype of the company's Starship Mars rocket, took off around 5:15 pm CT and climbed about six miles over the coastal landscape, mimicking two previous test flights SpaceX has conducted that ended in an explosive crash . Wednesday marked the first successful landing for a Starship prototype.

""We've had a successful soft touch down on the landing pad,"" SpaceX engineer John Insprucker said during a livestream of the event. ""That's capping a beautiful test flight of Starship 10.""

Elon Musk's SpaceX now owns about a third of all active satellites in the sky,"Austin, Texas (CNN Business) SpaceX created a swarm of about a thousand satellites that is circulating about 340 miles overhead, and building the constellation has put SpaceX in a ""deep chasm"" of expenses, according to CEO Elon Musk. The constellation has also raised concerns about potential in-space collisions and the impact on astronomers' ability to study the night sky. But for some early customers of the $99-per-month Starlink service, the satellites are already improving how rural communities access the internet.

With the latest SpaceX launch last week, which carried 60 more internet-beaming satellites into space, the company's Starlink internet constellation grew to include about 1,000 active satellites — by far the largest array in orbit. SpaceX now owns about one third of all the active satellites in space.

More Starlink satellites were put in orbit last year than had been launched by all the rocket providers in the world in 2019

SpaceX has promised its satellite clusters will bring cheap, high-speed internet to the masses by beaming data to every corner of the globe. The company now says it has roughly 10,000 customers, which proves that Starlink is no longer ""theoretical and experimental,"" the company said in a February 4 filing with the Federal Communications Commission.

For comparison, Verizon, one of the most popular fiber-optic internet providers, has more than 6 million customers.

Broadcom AVGO At least one participant in Starlink's beta testing program, Steve Opfer, a manager at chipmakerwho works out of his in rural Wisconsin home, said he ""could not be happier"" with his service — echoing what dozens of beta testers have said in online forums.

Whether or not Starlink will become a sustainable business, however, remains to be seen. Musk noted in a tweet Tuesday morning that the company ""needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable.""

He also refloated the idea of one day taking SpaceX's Starlink business public, saying that could happen ""once we can predict cash flow reasonably well."" Musk had said last year that the company had "" zero thoughts "" about a Starlink IPO.

endured The Starlink network is the largest and most meaningful attempt in history to build a low-latency, space-based internet service for consumers, and Musk noted Tuesday that several previous attempts to create such a network have been abandoned orendured bankruptcy (latency refers to how much lag time or delay is built into a internet service). Systems that require data to travel longer distances, such as more traditional internet satellites that orbit thousands of miles from Earth, create longer lag times. Low-Earth orbit constellations such as Starlink aim to drastically reduce latency by orbiting massive networks of satellites just a few hundred miles over ground.

The idea has its critics. Fiber-optic-based internet providers, for example, are pushing back against the federal government's decision to award SpaceX $885.5 million dollars in subsidies. Professional astronomers are also concerned about light pollution. And the sheer number of satellites that make up the Starlink constellation — and other networks planned by companies such as OneWeb and Amazon — has space experts worried about traffic jams and the risk of collisions that could create plumes of debris.

Here's where those controversies stand, and what SpaceX has done to respond to its critics.

Rural broadband

SpaceX and the FCC are facing blowback after the company was awarded nearly $900 million in subsidies through the FCC's Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, despite objections from traditional telecom companies and even some regulators.

Some beta testers have reported top-of-the-line speeds, but as of late 2020, they were also reportedly experiencing intermittent outages because SpaceX hadn't launched enough satellites to guarantee continuous coverage. It also remains to be seen how affordable SpaceX's service will be. CNBC reported in October, citing emails shared with those who expressed interest in becoming Starlink customers, that the service could cost about $99 a month, plus a one-time fee of about $500 for the router and antenna. SpaceX has not yet publicly released Starlink's price points or terms of service.

Musk said in a tweet Tuesday that if Starlink doesn't fail, ""the cost to end users will improve every year."" Yet many still argue that the network will, ultimately, be too expensive to provide the type of paradigm-shifting internet coverage that SpaceX has advertised.

Still, beta testers such as Opfer argue that Starlink is a vast improvement over what many residents of rural areas are used to. Before Starlink, he and his wife relied on HughesNet or ViaSat, a more traditional satellite-based internet provider that has large satellties orbiting thousands of miles from Earth, whose services are known to be bogged down by frustrating lag times , or high latency.

Opfer's Starlink connection still has some spotty service, which he attributes to the fact that SpaceX is still building up the constellation. The company has said that the total number of satellites could be as high as 40,000. But ""when Starlink works bad, it's not worse than the best of ViaSat,"" Opfer told CNN Business.

ViaSat's head of residential broadband Evan Dixon told CNN Business that ViaSat has invested ""tens of millions of dollars in addressing, and mitigating latency that people will experience"" using ViaSat's service. In a recent earnings report the company's executive chairman, Mark Dankberg, also indicated that the company is skeptical of Starlink's efficacy. He referred to low-Earth orbit constellations like Starlink as ""technologies that are unproven and may not be able to meet the obligations that are associated with them.""

Astronomy and orbital debris

Professional astronomers have been concerned about how Starlink satellites — which are fairly large at 550 lbs- — will impact the ground-based telescopes that have long been at the heart of breakthroughs in astrophysics and cosmology. Through much of last year, astronomers were working with the company on ways to make the satellites appear dimmer in space.

After initially trying a dark coating, SpaceX settled on using a retractable sun visor. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said those have been present on every Starlink satellite launched since last summer. That has made most of them invisible to the naked eye — a win for communities that want to limit light pollution in night sky.

But the satellites do still interfere with observatories that are essential to astronomers' efforts to study the cosmos. That has scientists scrambling to figure out how to scrub telescope data that is speckled with bright streaks created by the Starlink satellites. That uses up valuable resources that astronomers hoped to put toward their research rather than ""trying to clean the bugs off our windshield just so we can see out of our cars,"" said Meredith Rawls, a research scientist with the Vera C.

McDowell and Rawls applaud SpaceX's desire to keep satellites at lower altitudes, below 1,000 km (or 310 miles). Keeping Starlink satellites in a lower orbit makes them less of a nuisance for telescopes, and it guarantees that satellites that malfunction will be dragged out of orbit in a matter of months, rather than becoming uncontrollable projectiles that can threaten other satellites for centuries.

Astronomers and space traffic experts are still concerned about the lack of regulation around satellite brightness and orbital traffic. OneWeb's satellite internet constellation, for example, orbits higher than 1,000 km. And if any one of its 6,000 planned satellites malfunctions, it could become a major issue.",2021-02-11 00:00:00
SpaceX just got a big contract to launch two pieces of a future Moon space station,"Austin, Texas (CNN Business) NASA is giving SpaceX more than $330 million for a mission that will launch two key pieces of the Gateway, a space station that NASA plans to put in orbit around the moon as part of the space agency's Artemis program.

The Artemis program is the American government's plan to establish a permanent human presence in deep space.

SpaceX will launch ""the foundational elements of the Gateway"" — including a cylindrical module that will serve as astronaut living quarters and a large, box-shaped unit that will provide power and communications services to the space station — aboard one of its Falcon Heavy rockets ""no earlier than May 2024,"" NASA said in a press release this week.

The deal makes clear that NASA's plans to establish a human settlement on the moon will rely heavily on SpaceX's rockets, which the company has spent years billing as cheaper alternatives to the rockets made by legacy launch providers such as United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

The Falcon Heavy, which looks like three of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets strapped together, made its debut in 2018, and drew widespread attention for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's decision to use his cherry red Tesla roadster as a dummy payload for the Falcon Heavy's inaugural launch.",2021-02-10 00:00:00

The extinction crisis is far worse than you think.",
'We are failing the elephants',"At least that's how I remember it. I was 7.

I'm wedged between a cousin and my father, my grandmother perched behind. We are in the back of an open pickup near the banks of the Olifants River in South Africa.

""Drive!"" we shout at my uncle in the cab, banging on the roof.

But banging on the roof is our signal to stop.

The truck stops and the elephant is right behind us. We can see the milk discharging from her teats. Her newborn is somewhere hidden in the bushes.

My dad pulls out an antique double-barreled shotgun. He loads it with birdshot to fire in the air.

""Don't shoot the elephant,"" my gran cries and smacks him.

It would be like shooting an elephant with a tic-tac.

I am crying, and so is my cousin. We smell the elephant musk; we can see the horizon through its legs.

My uncle sees the elephant looming in his rearview mirror. He hits the accelerator.

Outrunning the charging animal, we bounce along the dirt track. Shortly after, she turns back.

We are safe. Right around the corner, the truck's axle breaks in an aardvark hole.

My family often recounts this story. And from that incident, I learned elephants had to be respected -- even feared.

It means no worries

Imagine my alarm, then, nearly 30 years later, when I am assigned by CNN to a story in the Maasai Mara in Kenya.

The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years.

The guide drives right up to a breeding herd of elephants in the grasslands and promptly switches off the engine.

""Shouldn't we keep it on,"" I say, ""and maybe not be so close.""

""The elephants here are relaxed,"" he smiles, ""Hakuna Matata.""

Meaning: ""No worries.""

I can't understand it. The elephants don't charge. They do not seem agitated, as has been my experience. They completely ignore us.

To be sure, elephants can be dangerous -- and sometimes deadly. But in this section of the Mara, there hasn't been hunting for decades. They are used to the tourist vehicles.

The game farm from my childhood near Olifants bordered a hunting reserve to the west. At the time, they still culled elephants in Kruger National Park to the east.

The elephants knew.

""Elephants have a cognitive sense of where they are safe and where they are at risk,"" Mike Chase, the lead scientist on the Great Elephant Census, told me on a recent trip to Botswana, where he's been tracking elephant movements for years. The census is a pioneering pan-African aerial survey that aims to count the continent's savanna elephant populations.

""This is really the front line, this is as far as they come, they will no longer move across eastern Namibia into Angola and Zambia, fearful of the consequences of poaching,"" says Chase.

As poaching rises, the elephants know to stay away.

And they remember.

No, they don't forget

It's sometimes tempting to anthropomorphize -- to give an animal human characteristics -- but the more I speak to people about elephants, the more elephants seem special.

I met up with Chase with Ingrid Formanek, one of CNN's most experienced field producers.

Ingrid's connection to Botswana runs deep.

In 1999 she moved to Maun, on the doorstep of the Okavango Delta, to document the rehabilitation of elephants. She lived there on and off for five years.

She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. Ingrid Formanek, CNN

Ingrid recounts the story of an elephant orphaned in the Kruger culls, called Shireni.

Shireni's handler taught her a trick: to remove her handler's hat with her trunk and to put it on her own head and then to put it back on her handler's. Ingrid observed as the elephant learned the behavior.

Nearly a decade later, Ingrid went back and saw Shireni.

""She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. She made the link to that time in our lives,"" says Ingrid. """"Shireni hadn't done that in all the interim years. I was amazed, and truth be told, flattered.""

Anybody who has studied or worked with elephants has their own stories about how sharp elephant memories are.

Experts like Dame Daphne Sheldrick, who has rescued hundreds of orphaned calves, talks about elephants remembering people years later, and the things that happened to them -- good and bad.

Sheldrick speaks of elephants reintroduced to the wild who have returned years, sometimes decades, later for help with an injury or just to say ""hello.""

Vanishing herds

Despite their obvious emotional intelligence and survival instincts, elephants can't escape the ravages of humans.

Elephants are slaughtered by poachers who seek their ivory tusks.

Before European colonization, scientists believe that Africa may have held as many as 20 million elephants; by 1979 only 1.3 million remained -- and the Great Elephant Census revealed this year that things have gotten far worse.

In the seven years between 2007 and 2014, numbers plummeted by at least 30%, or 144,000 elephants.

As of July, Africa's savannah is now home to only 352,271 elephants, according to the Great Elephant Census . Overall, including forest elephants, there are thought to be between 400,000 and 500,000 elephants across Africa.

And the specific cases are even more disturbing: In the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, and Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, elephant populations have plummeted by more than 75% in the past 10 years as poachers cut down family herds, according to the survey.

""When you think of how many elephants occurred in areas 10 or 20 years ago, it's incredibly disheartening,"" says Chase.

""Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted.""

In Botswana, elephants were long thought to be safe. It was part of southern Africa's ""haven"" that comprises 60% of all savannah elephants counted in the census.

But the ivory poaching wars, driven primarily by Asian demand, are on its doorstep.

Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted. Mike Chase, Great Elephant Census

Botswana is fighting an unconventional war to try to stop the slaughter, with the Botswana Defense Force mobilized throughout the border region.

More than 700 specially trained soldiers are stationed in 40 bases in the far north.

That protection no longer seems enough.

A new memory

From a distance, it appears the elephant could be resting. But the smell reveals the truth.

A once glorious bull lies lifeless in a dry section of the Linyanti swamp in Botswana. His face hacked off by poachers.

As we approach, we see the tusks have been taken. The trunk is 10 paces from the body. The carcass is perhaps two or three days old. And it is just one of more than 20 we have counted in Linyanti in just over 48 hours.

Now, with current rates of poaching, they will be wiped out from some of their range states.

They could even go locally extinct, says Chase.

""I've been asked if I'm optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Africa's elephants,"" he says, ""and on days like today, I feel that we are failing the elephants.""

This horrific scene could be the only way we remember them.",2016-12-11 00:00:00
Imagine a world without giraffes,"John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . This story is part of CNN's "" Vanishing "" series. Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved .

Its construction-crane neck, toothpick legs, knocked knees and two-story stature make it an awkwardly lovable favorite of children's book authors and cartoonists. This animal brings an odd sort of wonder to the savannahs of Africa.

But perhaps it's best for us to start imagining a world without the humble giraffe.

It moves up from the category called ""least concern.""

The reason: a sharp 36% to 40% decline in giraffe populations in recent decades.

In 1985, the group said, there were as many as 163,452 giraffes.

Now the estimate is 97,562.

This puts the giraffe in good company. The elephant, the orangutan, certain bees, coral -- so many of the Earth's mind-blowingly cool creatures face extinction risk these days. If poaching rates continue, some fear African elephants will be extinct in 20 years. Scientists worry coral reefs will mostly vanish by 2050 because humans continue pumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere, warming up the oceans and making them more acidic, and making life hard for coral.

I've spent much of 2016 reporting on the mass extinction event that's brewing all around the world for a CNN series called ""Vanishing."" That reporting will debut on CNN International on Friday and on this website Monday morning.

If there's one take-away from my travels, it's this: We can't take species for granted.

We too often assume they'll survive one generation to the next -- that those elephants or giraffes will be out there, somewhere.

They won't. Not unless we humans drastically change our ways.

In California, I met with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of Stanford University's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve , and a global expert on extinction. He told me that we humans have -- at the very most -- 20 years to change the way we treat nature or we will bring about the sixth mass extinction event in the entire history of Earth. We are talking dinosaur-ending stuff here -- as in three-quarters of all known species, not just the cute and iconic ones, could vanish in a couple of centuries.

Having trouble imagining that world?

""The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone,"" he said. ""That would be a very impoverished landscape.""

It certainly would.

If you're not moved by that, consider the consequences for humans, too.

""We are basically annihilating the life on our planet -- and that is the only known life ... in the entire universe,"" Paul Ehrlich, also of Stanford, told me. ""It's life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It's life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don't have the diversity of other organisms, we're done.""

What's causing the collapse?

Barnosky has boiled it all down to three words: ""power, food and money.""

Power, meaning we're burning fossil fuels for electricity, transit and heat. That's warming the planet and wreaking havoc all over the world. We're not just talking polar bears here -- amphibians, oceans, everything is affected.

By food, he's referring to the fact that humans have plowed up or otherwise altered about 40% of the Earth's surface, he said, for agricultural production, much of it for livestock. Some biologists think we have to set aside huge chunks of land -- 50% of the Earth, according to Harvard University's E.O. Wilson -- to stop the sixth extinction from occurring, or to lessen its scope.

Add the population boom to this and you can see why farms are going to be a big issue this century.

Finally, money. That means poaching -- illegal networks are decimating the populations of some animals, including elephants, rhinos and the pangolin . And it means thinking of nature as an endless vat of cash.

""How do we get off of treating nature as this bottomless checking account and begin to treat it as an investment account, where we're living off the interest?"" Barnosky asked during our interview.

I'm not sure how we'll change. But I have to hope that understanding the scope of this crisis is part of moving toward solutions. Giraffes are constricted by human development; they're poached for their tails, which are used as bracelets, and for their meat, according to the African Wildlife Foundation . We shouldn't see the giraffe's plight as an isolated crisis. Humans are reshaping the face of Earth as never before. It happens in slow motion, making us easily distracted from the cumulative destruction one generation passes to the next. And many of us are so disconnected from nature -- we see it through car windows, from the suburbs, on safari -- that we don't realize the scope of our responsibility in this collapse.

Imagine a world without giraffes.

In the long term, without big changes, that's what we reasonably can expect.",2016-12-08 00:00:00
Listening for the amphibian apocalypse,"John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . This story is part CNN's "" Vanishing "" series. Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved .

La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (CNN) The ""blue jeans"" frog is practically screaming to be noticed. Its head is blood red, and its legs are denim blue. It looks like it's wearing jeggings. But this little critter, also known as the strawberry poison dart frog, is only about the size of a fingernail. It spends most of its time either high up in the trees in this Central American rainforest or rooting around in the gooey ""leaf litter"" of the forest floor.

As such, it's practically invisible.

Unless you open your ears.

Chit-chit-chit-chit-chit.

""It sounds like an insect. It buzzes.""

That's Bryan Pijanowski, a ""soundscape ecologist"" from Purdue University and one of the few people paying attention to the fact that nature -- especially the amphibian part -- is growing exceptionally quiet these days. Pijanowski and collaborators from around the world have been strapping audio recorders to trees here at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. The microphones look like funny little robots -- boxes with windscreen ears on each side.

Researchers have installed microphone sensors in the rainforeset to listen for the sound of extinction.

The equipment has a critical mission.

It's listening for the sound of extinction.

Have you heard it already? I ask Pijanowski.

""I think so,"" he tells me. His muted, baritone voice sounds like a public radio host sharing secrets with you in a library. ""There is evidence all around the world.""

'Rapid extinctions'

Scientists fear Earth is on the verge of the sixth era of extinction.

There have been five mass extinctions in the planet's history.

Biologists fear we are on the verge of -- or have already entered -- the sixth era of extinction in Earth's history.

If we usher in the sixth, three-quarters of all species could disappear in a couple of centuries, says Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford and author of ""Dodging Extinction: Power, Food, Money and the Future of Life on Earth.""

""The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction,"" he told me, ""is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone.""

If you study amphibians, it can seem like that dystopian future already is here.

About 10% of birds and a third of mammals are at high extinction risk.

Not good.

But more than 40% of amphibians are in similar straits -- making them worse off than any other vertebrate group, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Amphibians are vanishing without warning, and often without explanation.

Chytrid fungus, which humans helped spread, has decimated frog populations around the world.

""In the past 30 years or so, we've seen really dramatic, really rapid extinctions for frog populations all over the world,"" says Steven Whitfield, a conservation ecologist at Zoo Miami who joined Pijanowski and me on the visit to Costa Rica this summer. ""Many of these extinctions are due to habitat loss. But other extinctions have occurred in pristine rainforests like this -- places that look healthy but the frogs are telling us there's something clearly wrong.""

'Unable to see it'

Whitfield spent years studying frogs at this research station in this particular forest.

I ask him to show me how it's done.

It doesn't take long to realize it's not easy work. When Whitfield conducts a study, he often ropes off a small plot of land and then spends hours searching for every single frog he can find.

The search begins with his ears.

CNN Map

""I'll hear [a frog] call and spend half an hour or more looking into a small patch of vegetation, knowing that it's right there and that I need to find it but unable to see it,"" he tells me.

Whitfield is an expert at pulling frog sounds out of the EDM freak-out that is the rainforest. If you've been, then you know these places, in healthy conditions, are LOUD. I actually had a hard time falling asleep some nights in Costa Rica because it sounded (awesomely) like the forest was yelling at me; and I woke up early to screams of howler monkeys. (Fun aside: Researchers warn newcomers to always wear shoes -- because, vipers -- and to watch the trees, since the ""bullet ant,"" which delivers the world's most painful bite, like a bullet, is all around.)

Whitfield's amphibian-listening powers are impressive, but even he has trouble finding frogs by sight. He takes me and a group of researchers from the Center for Global Soundscapes deep into the forest just after dusk one evening, when some frogs tend to be the most active. Our headlamps provide a washed-out sort of tunnel vision of the diversity hiding all around us.

A Mexican Treefrog at La Selva Biological Station, which is a hub for field ecology.

Whitfield can hear and identify frogs at great distance. There's the ""chit-chit-chit"" of the blue jeans frog (the one with jeggings), the panicked meowing of a creature aptly nicknamed the ""kitten frog."" He hears the slot-machine rattle of the ""glass frog,"" which has a translucent belly, allowing you to see organs through its skin. Smoky jungle frogs scream like human babies when they're threatened, and the tink frog seems to be named for its metallic call, which sounds like that ear-piercing noise a smoke detector makes when it wants you to change its battery.

This place is way beyond ""ribbit."" The sounds are staggering.

But finding these frogs by sight?

That's more difficult.

In a couple of hours, we saw only a handful of frogs.

Spiders almost seem easier to come by.

""Those bite,"" Whitfield says, pointing to one. ""Don't touch that.""

'Something is happening'

I'm grateful for the research Whitfield and other field ecologists have contributed when it comes to frogs. Their diligent, painstaking, searching-through-the-leaves work is how we know important (and fun) frog facts, like that the female blue jeans frog is an amphibian supermom.

A view from the forest canopy at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica.

Her tadpoles hatch on the forest floor, he says, but that's a precarious place for them, so she carries them, on her back, high up into the forest canopy, sometimes 10 to 15 meters off the ground -- about 33 to 50 feet. She drops the tadpoles off in little puddles of water up there in the forest canopy and makes a mental note of their location. She does this again and again, leaving her young all over the forest canopy. She remembers where all these tadpoles are (!!) and spends her days climbing the trees to deliver food.

""That's pretty complicated behavior for a tiny little frog,"" Whitfield says.

His research also has helped show that frogs at La Selva are in decline.

""We have really good long-term data on what's been happening with frog populations over four decades,"" he tells me. ""In the forest here now, there's only about 25% as many frogs as there were sustained throughout the 1970s. And for us, that's a concern because it says that something is happening to this rainforest but we don't fully understand what that is.""

The strawberry poison dart frog is sometimes called the blue jeans frog.

That's worth stating again.

Locally, only a quarter of the frogs from the 1970s remain.

Meanwhile, the human population jumped from less than 4 billion to 7.4 billion today.

Whitfield's search-the-forest work is critical.

But even he would say it could use a technological assist.

That's where Pijanowski and his tree-hugging microphones come in.

He's listening for changes Whitfield might not be able to see.

'Your ears ring'

Bryan Pijanowski is an ecologist by training. Before that, he was a ""quiet alterboy-ish kind of kid"" in the Midwest who also was sort of an audiophile -- and an amateur musician. He played guitar in a high school band called Destruction. ""Everybody wanted you to play 'Freebird,'"" he said, ""so that's what I played -- over and over again.""

In school, he set out to become a medical doctor but changed his mind after hearing the ""dawn chorus"" of a swamp in Michigan. He became obsessed with nature and its music.

Bryan Pijanowski is a ""soundscape ecologist"" from Purdue University. He's also director of the Center for Global Soundscapes.

So he studied birds and ecology, and eventually turned to ""soundscapes,"" the emerging field of using sound to understand the shifts in the health and function of ecosystems.

The work makes him so sound-focused he now has to wear earplugs to sleep.

He can't stop listening.

""There are times when [the rainforest] is almost too loud,"" he tells me.

""It's like being too close to the speakers at a concert. Your ears ring.""

La Selva is now one of his study sites. He's working to develop others around the world, including underwater to listen for changes to coral reefs. His microphones have taken him to the tip of South America and the deserts of Mongolia. But this site is special both because the rainforest is nearly untouched -- and because there's so much data. Pijanowski got his hands on recordings that date back to 2008 and started making his own recordings here in 2010. At the peak of his research, he'd installed 34 microphone sensors.

Now he has 255,000 recordings here, totaling about 6.8 years of tape.

He's still analyzing the data with the help of computer algorithms.

What he's heard -- or rather, what he doesn't hear -- definitely freaks him out.

'Acoustic fossils'

One evening, insects and frogs chattering outside, Pijanowski sits me down in an open-window classroom at the research station and shows me some of his sound files.

He visualizes the audio in charts called spectrograms.

These charts illuminate trends that a walk through the forest can't.

Take a look at this La Selva recording from 2008.

And then another from 2015, recorded under similar conditions.

Hear the difference?

Those are just two moments.

Pijanowski's team can compress a year's worth of sound into one chart.

Take a look at what happens when you look at those years side by side. The red parts of the charts indicate more audible activity. The main frog frequencies grow much bluer, and quieter.

A year of audio is compressed into spectrograms. Red indicates more sound coming from the forest. Blue is much quieter.

It's too soon to draw scientific conclusions from this, Pijanowski tells me.

But he's frightened.

""I'm worried that these would potentially become acoustic fossils,"" he says.

""In other words, the animals that are in these files are no longer alive. And the only record that we have of some of their presence is in an audio recording.

""That is somewhat disturbing to me, as a scientist and also as a citizen of this planet.""

A collaborator of Pijanowski's, Michael Towsey, tells me he has a file of an Australian frog that's thought to be extinct -- a recording that already is an acoustic fossil.

You can listen to that frog's call here on the Internet.

But you can no longer hear it in nature.

'Most beautiful sound in the world'

Why does this matter?

There's the self-interested argument.

Here's Steven Whitfield's take on that.

""We are all dependent on the planet for clean water, for oxygen. And ecosystems not only provide food to people but rainforests like this are an important source of medicines. Some of the frogs that live in the rainforest here have chemicals in their skin that have been found to be important medicines. They can be painkillers or heart medicines. So these are things that can be really useful for medicine. And we'd like to not lose those. If we do lose those, it hurts us all.""

Frog populations at La Selva Biological Station have plunged 75% since the 1970s, according to Steven Whitfield, Zoo Miami.

There's the ecosystem collapse argument.

Bryan Pijanowski: ""Some of the theoretical work that we're doing and ecology suggests that we could have ecosystem collapse. And that's not good ... You don't wanna start removing organisms and expect the ecosystem to survive and function in a healthy way. It could very well mean that some of the things that we are much more emotionally attached to are lost.""

That should be enough to sway a pragmatist.

Still, I think there's a more human reason you should care about the disappearance of amphibians.

Chances are you never or rarely see frogs in your day-to-day life. But when you learn about them -- those with translucent bellies, supermom instincts, blue-jean legs and poisonous skin, all of which are calling to be noticed by each other if not by us -- then it's hard to ignore their plight.

There are multiple causes of the amphibian apocalypse, but all the trouble points back to us. We've helped carry a killer fungus, called chytrid, around the globe, with disastrous consequences. Climate change has been implicated in frog die-offs. Pollution is a big problem since frogs live part-time in water and basically breathe through their skin.

They are the front lines -- the most vulnerable of species.

Yet few of us seem truly outraged by their disappearance.

Maybe that will change if we start listening more closely.

After all, frog choruses are some of the most fascinating songs in nature.

One recording from the island of Borneo -- called ""dusk by the frog pond"" -- was voted by the always-wise Internet as ""the most beautiful sound in the world.""

It's not too late to stop the sixth extinction from taking permanent hold of us, according to Barnosky, the Stanford researcher. We have at most 20 years to change our ways.

There's hope. But we must ditch fossil fuels, mitigating climate change. We have to stop the spread of invasive species and disease. And, in the view of one prominent biologist, we must set aside half the planet for the benefit of biodiversity and nature.

Otherwise, we risk silencing the frogs.

And perhaps the rest of nature, too.",2016-12-11 00:00:00
Plastic island: How our trash is destroying paradise,"Midway Atoll, North Pacific Ocean (CNN) -- The distance from humanity yawns out in front of you when you stand on the pale sands of this tiny Pacific island. Midway Atoll is just about the furthest piece of land from civilization and its constant engine whir, data and jostle. Standing on the island's remote shoreline brings a calm and humility -- until you look down at your feet.

On the beach lies a motorcycle helmet, a mannequin's head, an umbrella handle, and a flip-flop. They didn't fall from a plane or off a ship, and there aren't any civilians living here who could have left them behind. They were washed in with the tide, most likely from China or the US, thousands of miles away -- part of an enormous plastic garbage patch, spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, which you probably contribute to. And these are just the bits of it we can see. Plastic has become a vital part of our lives of convenience. Yet the coffee cup lids, water bottles and bags we use once and throw away do end up somewhere -- in landfills, but also in the ocean. Nearly every piece of plastic ever made still exists today. More than five trillion pieces of plastic are already in the oceans, and by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish, by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Some 8 million tons of plastic trash leak into the ocean annually, and it's getting worse every year. Americans are said to use 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour. Nothing is an emergency until you feel the burn, or see the red lights. Here plastic's impact is staring you in the face. Midway is out of sight, but again it is on the front line. Once home to the decisive battle that turned World War Two in favor of the US in the Pacific, it's now locked in a new fight.

The smell of decay You have to fly to Midway at night. Only then do the millions of birds that swarm the island in high season vacate the runway. We could only get here with permission from the US government and the help of a private jet. The smell hits you first, and catches in your throat. It's the whiff of decay, of thousands of birds' bodies rotting. Part of this is nature: CNN visited the island in June -- the time of year when the Laysan albatross lay their chicks, who must learn to fly, or die. But part of it is man-made: When you tear open the fragile ribcages of the birds who did not survive -- as US Fish and Wildlife Service Superintendent Matthew Brown did in front of us -- the sheer volume of plastic waste now in our world becomes apparent. Inside the slight skeleton of one albatross, we found bottle tops and a cigarette lighter amongst seemingly endless tiny shards of plastic. It's as if plastic actually was the bird's diet. These brightly colored plastic fragments were picked out of the sea by the bird's parents, who mistook them for food, then fed them to their offspring. The birds can't digest the plastic pieces but they still feel full, which causes malnutrition and death, according to researchers. Volunteers here have an almost full-time job scooping up the corpses. kilograms of plastic have entered the ocean since you started reading They have tried to clean Midway up; the huge dump of plastic trash sitting on the runway awaiting collection by boats is evidence of that. But it's almost impossible because so much washes ashore daily -- not to mention the five tons the birds fly onto the island inside in their stomachs each year, according to Brown. The Eastern Island is now littered with tiny fragments of plastic. The birds die and decay, but the plastic inside them stays forever in the sand -- a layer of man's doing that will never go away. Midway will probably vanish under rising ocean levels before the plastic decays. Albatrosses walk along a plastic-littered beach in Midway. Jackson Loo/CNN The plastic-filled stomach of a dead albatross. Jackson Loo/CNN ""These are the classic 'canary in the coal mine' scenarios,"" said Brown. ""This is an animal that relies entirely on the ocean for its survival, just like 3 billion people do. If their children, their chicks, are being impacted by plastic this much, it is simply a forbearer of what is coming for us."" From fish to plate So much of the damage is on the edge of the invisible. If you kneel down on Midway and stick your hand into the hot sand, you can pull up a troubling multicolored array of particles. These are what activists call the ""new sand"" -- plastic that has broken down into smaller and smaller pieces, and then become part of the shoreline. Are you eating your own toothbrush? Your toothbrush is one of many everyday items made of plastic. Most plastics are made from oil. Plastic production has surged in the past 50 years and could double again by 2036. 15 million tons in 1964 311 million tons in 2014 612 million tons in 2036 Billions of toothbrushs are thrown away every year. But less than 14% of plastics are recycled globally. At least 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans each year - that's one garbage truck a minute. More than 5 trillion pieces of plastic are in our oceans, weighing 269,000 tons - the same as 3,585 blue whales. By 2050, there may be more plastic in our oceans than fish. Most plastic doesn't biodegrade - it breaks down into smaller pieces, which attracts toxins... You could be ingesting up to 11,000 pieces of microplastic each year - and the toxins that come with them. Sources: Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Lisbeth Van Cauwenberghe These smaller particles are what end up in the food chain. The smallest ones, called nano-plastics, sink deep into the ocean and can end up in plankton. Larger pieces, known as micro-plastics, float in a soup, suspended in water, and are eaten by fish. The fish then get eaten by ""apex predators"" higher up the food chain -- including humans, or the Hawaiian Monk Seal. We don't know as much as we want to about what plastic has done to these seals -- they're endangered, so there are restrictions on opening them up for study by scientists. But there are already troubling signs. Jessica Bohlander, a marine biologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says the seals are acting as a ""sentinel for exposure to plastics and other persistent organic pollutants for humans."" ""A few individual animals we have seen have very high levels [of micro-plastics], particularly in adult males,"" she said. Bohlander says plastic ingestion could be causing reproductive problems for the seals -- and the bigger the animal, the bigger the concentration of plastic. ""It is very troubling,"" she said. ""With every step of the food chain, the concentration that can be measured in the tissues of animals becomes magnified.""

11,000 pieces of plastic each year Seafood is essential to human life, but there is growing evidence that fish may prefer eating plastic to food. Swedish scientists recently demonstrated that larval Perch raised in waters containing micro-plastics ""only ate plastic and ignored their natural food source of free-swimming zooplankton."" This diet of plastic stunted growth rates, reduced hatching rates, and caused abnormal behaviors in the young fish, according to the study. There's also evidence that plastic is harmful to humans. The US government says styrene -- one of the key ingredients in plastic -- is probably a human carcinogen. It is studying the effects of plastic litter on marine life and plans to launch an inquiry into the effects on human health, including fetal formation. One study found that man-made marine debris may cause ""physical harm"" to humans when ingested via seafood. Another estimated that Europeans who eat shellfish could be exposed to 11,000 pieces of micro-plastic each year. What science hasn't proven yet is whether the plastic in the fish we eat directly damages our health. But it's getting there, and the case for real government concern is growing. And Midway, just by dint of its own distance and damage, is making that case. Matthew Brown told me he eats sushi much less than he used to. ""Plastics also attract other contaminants, so if you are eating food that has little bits of blue and red in there, these are attracting ... other contaminants in the ocean. This has a real impact on our primary food source.""

The choice the world has made We took a boat out from the island, towards the coral reef that surrounds it. There, you can feel the awesome power of nature. Caught in the reef nearby was a sight far more troubling than the bottles we had seen float past us on the water. In one inlet was a soup of tiny white pellets. A huge piece of Styrofoam packaging had been caught, now bobbing and slowly breaking down. In its thick soup was a bottle-top, a feather, and other gunk. You could swim into it easily, let your head emerge up in its midst. Signs of resilience and defiance in nature abounded, but in one corner, man's carelessness had occupied a visible space and, perhaps for longer, an invisible one. We simply do not know what we have already done. The hardest part about the journey to Midway is the sense of powerlessness it leaves you with. The damage there began with choices -- and litter -- made decades ago. And the problem is growing, not shrinking, as humanity gets more environmentally aware. Stopping this flow of trash would require an incredible change in the daily behavior of 7 billion people. China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka are considered the five worst offenders when it comes to plastic pollution, according to a study published in Science, and you can anticipate as much success telling people there to stop using disposable plastics as you would do in the US. Road test the phrase: ""I'm sorry, you can't have that coffee as you haven't brought your own reusable cup."" kilograms of plastic have entered the ocean since you started reading So what can you do? Very little, unless we all do it. You can start by bringing water bottles to work, or a reusable fork to the café, or insisting on less packaging for products. For now, the balance of convenience versus the likely risk to human health is in the favor of the coffee cup. If the science isn't there yet, public opinion won't be either.

There is a tiny glimmer of hope amidst this looming disaster, one I often heard while talking to researchers, one that shows people can change. It's a recent example of something so glaringly, obviously bad for the planet -- and people -- that for centuries was accepted as a normal part of our happy, modern world. Remember smoking? We don't do that as much anymore.",
"When the coral disappears, so will they","John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . This story is part of a CNN series called "" Vanishing ."" Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.

Nosy Andragnombala, Madagascar (CNN) It's 2 a.m. when the half-moon wakes Hary. He senses its gravitational pull -- feels the moon coaxing fish out of a nearby reef and into his fishing nets here at the edge of Africa.

The 33-year-old fisherman seems to have an almost-telepathic relationship with the coral that surround this castaway island, which is little more than a heap of sand off the southwest coast of Madagascar. That relationship was passed down from his father, and it's one held by Vezo people here.

That word -- Vezo -- is taken to mean ""at struggle with the sea,"" and residents of Nosy Andragnombala define themselves by that struggle. At birth, their umbilical cords are placed in seashells and tossed as an offering into deep blue waters.

They are part of the reef, and it is part of them.

There's little else: No electricity or freshwater. No industry, no jobs, no school. If you don't know the reef -- can't feel its tides and sense its moods -- then you can't survive.

And that makes what's happening on this island all the more tragic.

The reef is disappearing.

Coral have started turning white and dying. No one here understands why.

Local theories abound. Was it that hurricane? A chemical spill? A curse? Moake, an older neighbor of Hary's, told me white coral snagged his fishing net one day. It spooked him, and now he won't return to that spot. ""I've already seen the white coral but I don't know what's caused it to become white,"" Hary tells me. ""I don't know whether it's something in the water that's caused it to turn white.""

Hary wakes well before dawn to cast fishing nets into the Mozambique Channel.

Yet, he's seen clues.

""There's a time when you see it,"" he says. ""During the hot season.""

Scientists can explain the mystery of the white coral.

But, frankly, I'm starting to see it as a curse, too.

A curse you and I cooked up.

'And then we wept'

By now, the storyline should be familiar: We humans are burning loads of fossil fuels and chopping down the rainforest, and that's causing the atmosphere to heat up rapidly.

That's true regardless of who's in the White House.

What's less understood is that the ocean is actually storing much of that heat.

Beneath the surface, there's evidence of a mass extinction brewing.

Coral are among the silent victims, and the results are undeniable.

This year, amid record heat, 93% of the Great Barrier Reef experienced bleaching , the term used to describe sick coral that eject the bright-colored algae that live on them. Bleached coral turn white, and while they're not dead, they are suffocating. The colorful algae feed the coral with the oxygen and sugar they need to survive. With prolonged or repeated bleaching, coral begin to die, eventually turning to rubble or becoming smothered by plants. It doesn't help that adding CO2 to the atmosphere and ocean also makes the waters more acidic, and worse still for the survival of coral.

CNN Map

The consequences are truly stunning.

Research indicates nearly all the world's coral reefs could be lost by 2050.

This is just one sign of the sweeping changes we humans are inflicting on the natural world, and ultimately on ourselves. Biologists say we are on the verge of the Earth's sixth mass-extinction event -- something akin to the end of the dinosaurs. Anthony Barnosky, a researcher at Stanford, told me we have perhaps 20 years to change course -- including addressing climate change -- or three-quarters of the world's species could vanish in coming centuries.

Overfishing and pollution also threaten coral in Madagascar. But climate change -- and the warming and ocean acidification that come with it -- is expected to land the soundest blow.

To stop that, we need to eliminate net carbon pollution.

Basically, that means purging fossil fuels from the global economy.

If we fail, there will be dire consequences.

Journalists often see the end of coral through the eyes of scientists. ""I showed the results of aerial surveys of #bleaching on the #GreatBarrierReef to my students, And then we wept,"" Terry Hughes, a professor at Australia's James Cook University, wrote on Twitter in April.

Or we focus on losses for the tourism industry, which could be considerable.

Those perspectives matter.

More critical, though, are the 275 million people who depend on coral reefs for survival.

Hary and Lydia are raising six children. They can't afford to send them to school.

They're people like Hary, his wife, Lydia, and the six children they're raising.

Their fates are linked to a catastrophe we are helping to cause.

'My children can't eat'

Hary stops by my tent on his midnight walk to the ocean.

""Ooh-OOH! Ooh-OOH!"" he calls.

Translation: Get up, reporter dude. The fish are waiting.

I stumble out of my sleeping bag, groggy and confused. Soon, we push off into the darkness of the Mozambique Channel in an outrigger canoe that Hary built by hand. Hary is in the back; the butt cheeks of his shorts are patched from years spent perched on the rails of the narrow boat. His second eldest son, Harizo, is up front. The 13-year-old is his dad's professional shadow.

A blood-colored moon hangs on the southern horizon. Father and son are faint silhouettes against the midnight sky and charcoal sea. The air tastes of salt, and the lull of the waves feels almost womb-like. Most surreal: The waters are bioluminescent, so each stroke of the paddle causes twinkling constellations of light to swim across the reef below us, as if mirroring the stars. The scene is exhilarating, especially for a city dweller like me.

In this moment I understand how completely tied Hary is to waters around the island.

As we paddle away from shore, sea melting into the distant horizon, I think about the disaster unfolding below the hull of the boat: The reef already is dying.

If we don't find anything out there, my children can't eat. Lydia, Nosy Andragnambala

A local nonprofit called Blue Ventures has been doing scuba surveys of reef health in this area. Their divers found 70% of reefs were bleached in April, at the peak of a heatwave, which is attributed partly to El Niño but also to the warming trend we're causing by burning fossil fuels.

Hary and the other fishermen know their catch is a fraction of what it once was.

""We really suffer when we go a week without catching anything,"" he says.

Their children cry from hunger, his wife, Lydia, tells me.

""If we don't find anything out there,"" she says, ""my children can't eat.""

'Ways of the sea'

Hary and Lydia's response to the crisis? Try harder.

They're nothing if not resourceful.

They moved to this island years ago because the reef on mainland Madagascar was too degraded -- and because the fishing was farther away. Hary lived out here with his father as a boy, and Lydia later joined him. They'd known each other as little kids in school. Neither was able to finish, though. They had to fish.

They have four kids together and care for at least two others; one is the son of a relative who died. The village is home to a few dozen people, and many depend, at least in part, on Hary's catch for their own survival.

Out here, people have to work together to make it.

After putting his net in the water about 3 a.m. Hary makes it back at shore by about 5 a.m. He is out again at dawn to collect his nets, and then spends the afternoon on the water, casting a long line with 50 hooks on it into the deep ocean just beyond the barrier of the reef.

In all, he spends about 12 hours per day at sea.

Lydia and the kids are hard at work, too. If you walk around Nosy Andragnombala, you're sure to see tiny children building and playing with wooden toy boats. They whittle out the hull and mast and then attach scrap-plastic sails. The kids push these little boats out onto the waves, tapping them with sticks so they catch the wind just so. When the children are about 10 years old, Hary says, they'll be ready to fish out on the water. He won't need to teach them to sail, though. They'll already understand how wind and wood work together.

Lydia searches reef flats near the island for octopus.

Like other women on the island, Lydia hunts octopus and cooks. At dusk, she boils fish on a fire while the sun sets and humpback whales perform their lumbering acrobatics on the horizon.

It's an idyllic place, but the struggle to live here is real. Several years ago, locals created an ocean reserve to protect the reef. They work with a village association to police the waters. Those efforts, combined with an intimate knowledge of the reef, make survival possible.

But barely.

One day, Lydia asks me, though an interpreter, if I want her to ""teach me the ways of the sea.""

I do, of course.

I slap some $12-a-bottle sunscreen on my face, and she leads me onto the ankle-deep reef flats, a spear in her hand and a notebook in mine.

'Hara, John!'

Lydia is a woman defined by brightness. Her shirt is magenta, yellow and blue. Her smile is loud and infectious, and she paints her face with a paste of mashed-up mangrove seeds, turning it orange and protecting it from the sun. Her intellect shines, too. If you duck down and follow her into her home, whose footprint is about the size of three queen mattresses and often sleeps eight, you'll notice two pieces of butcher paper pinned to the thatched walls. On them: English words translated into phonetics and then into Vezo, the local language.

""Water = oatere = rano.""

""Fish = fise = fia.""

""This is our octopus reserve = Dise ize ore aketapose rezeriva = Ato misy ty rezeriva horita nay.""

She has been learning English in case a visitor showed up someday.

""Photo, John! Photo!""

Lydia points at a black urchin in the ankle-deep water. Each time she sees something new -- especially spiky, don't-step-on-that stuff, like an urchin -- she gestures frantically and insists I take a photo and write down the Vezo word for the creature in my notebook.

""John, photo!"" A round, pink urchin.

""Photo!"" Some greenish blob that apparently will kill you.

""Horita!""

That's an octopus, which she identifies by noticing the way the creature has arranged a pile of rocks, just so, in front of its secret den. The spot is completely unremarkable to me until she dips her spear into the hole and then twists it gently, like a baker rolling bread sticks. A tentacle emerges and wraps itself around the stick. Lydia pulls the creature out, notes that it is large enough to harvest sustainably (she won't take small octopuses because she worries about depleting the reef; and the community has established its own reef management system to try to protect its natural resources) and then stabs the tip of the spear through its Jell-O head.

A black ink cloud puddles in the water.

She ties the octopus to a bright blue string and drags it like a rag doll.

The tour continues.

Local coral is damaged for many reasons, but climate change could deliver the knock-out punch.

""Hara, John!""

Hara means coral.

Lydia points at one piece of healthy coral in a mess of rubble, a vast expanse of reef that looks something like the ruins of an ancient city. It stretches on like almost as far as I can see, a few live coral here and there, but mostly khaki, beige and gray.

It is heartbreaking to see this rubble.

Especially juxtaposed against her enthusiasm.

'Don't touch it'

I struggle with whether or how to engage Hary and Lydia in a conversation about climate change and the white coral -- this foreign curse that understandably makes little sense out here.

How do you tell someone that factories and cars and deforestation on the other side of the world are slowly heating up the entire planet, warming the ocean, making it more acidic, and messing up reefs worldwide? It's a tricky concept even for those of us who are climate culprits, who live in polluted cities and burn coal to pump electricity and air conditioning into our homes.

Out here, there are no factories, no air pollution, no cars or roads. Lydia says she's only been in a car once in her life, and it was to take her son to another family member's funeral. Her son cried, she says, because he didn't understand what was happening. Only one or two cell phones (solar powered) exist on the island, and there's a single dusty television set. Its owner uses it mostly to play Kung Fu movies from a USB stick for the island's kids.

Yet, this is an existential crisis.

To be Vezo, according to some, you have to work on the water.

This place -- and its culture -- could vanish with the reef.

I ask James Paul, a diver who surveys reefs in this area for Blue Ventures, and is Vezo himself, how he handles local conversations about climate change.

It's difficult, he says.

""I tell them just be careful, it's sick. Don't touch it. If you touch it, it's dead quick.""

Of course, there are solutions.

But if you're on an island with essentially no carbon footprint there isn't much you can do to prevent global warming -- aside from sharing your story.

Their only real hope is for us to listen.

'We're as good as dead'

I invite Lydia to sit down on a sand dune to talk about all this.

I feel like the prophet of doom.

I tell her that people like me on the other side of the world -- people who are addicted to dirty energy sources, like coal and oil, and who drive around in cars and make things in factories that billow black smoke -- have a hand in turning the coral here white.

Lydia is a master at finding and identifying ocean creatures.

Yes, there are local problems contributing to problems with the coral. The cyclone that almost killed her son destroyed some coral, and overfishing plays a role. But scientists say people like me must change or coral reefs all over the world -- not just here -- will disappear.

She stares at me -- more in disbelief than anger.

Then she laughs, seemingly to cover the discomfort.

""We're as good as dead,"" she says.

""There'll be no more ocean livelihoods when the coral turns white.""

""It scares me, people far away are causing this,"" she adds, rightly. ""It's like they're the ones sending us this heat, which is destroying the coral. So what happens if there's something else they do or make that causes death here?""

She worries about her children. Before Hary's mother died two years ago, some of her kids lived with their grandmother on the mainland so they could attend classes. But after she died the family couldn't afford it, she tells me, so they had to come back to the island. ( School, by the way, costs only $3 per month per child , but the family earns too little.) She wants her children to grow up Vezo -- to know the ocean -- but she also wants them to have options.

Without an education, what other career options will they have?

What happens to them if all the coral turns white?

She turns to our translator and asks a question about me and a CNN videographer.

""So when they go back home, they'll teach people what they've learned here? They'll tell people about what they've seen? They'll tell people this is what life is like in Madagascar?""

She trails off.

""Maybe there are just too many cars where they're from.""

I tell her the reason I've come is to tell her story. And that yes, I hope that when people turn on their lights or start their cars or get on airplanes (or, most importantly, vote for public officials who care about this) that they will think about a tiny island in Madagascar.

About people whose lives are threatened by the curse of the white coral.

But, secretly, I worry about those of us causing the curse.

Will we actually care enough to stop?

Side to side

The night after that conversation I wake up with a piercing headache.

I'd been dreaming about swimming down a pristine canal that suddenly turns into an industrial wasteland.

Blue water turns brown and smells of gasoline.

Smoke fills the air.

Nosy Andragnambala is located off the coast of Madagascar, a large island nation in eastern Africa.

When I awake, I realize the smell of gas is real. I unzip the tent and walk into a stiff wind, toward the beach. The horizon glimmers the color of peach, the first sign of dawn.

Where is that smell coming from? I can almost taste the tang of gasoline in my mouth. But how can that be? There are no motors on the island.

Then I see it.

Our boat, with its 25-horsepower Yamaha engine.

We used the motor to cut across the Mozambique Channel to this island in an hour, as opposed to the three or four or five needed to cross by sail. The irony didn't hit me at the time. I figured we would need the motorboat to maximize the reporting we'd do.

We're as good as dead. There'll be no more ocean livelihoods when the coral turns white. Lydia, Nosy Andragnambala

We make these choices by default. Too often, we don't see them or smell them -- don't actually feel the results of our actions. That's particularly true of climate change, since the effects are both diffuse and long term. Our actions now determine the type of world Lydia's great-great-great-great-great grandchildren will inherit. Climate change is sinister that way.

There are signs of progress.

We're moving into the clean-energy era. Technology is helping.

But all this is happening at a glacial pace.

And it doesn't help that US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap the Paris Agreement, which aims to get the world to ditch fossil fuels and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

Will we do enough to save the coral -- and so many other species?

We depend on them more than we know.

I walk around the boat to get some fresh air, blowing in straight from the sea.

I sit down to watch the sunrise. A flock of birds hold formation in the wind. Crabs with little telescoping eyes skitter side to side in the sand. A hunk of dead coral is at my feet.

We are scheduled to leave Nosy Andragnombala in a day.

The scent of gasoline will evaporate then.

But our mark remains.",2016-12-11 00:00:00
The old man and the bee,"John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . This story is part of CNN's "" Vanishing "" series. Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved .

Mount Ashland, Oregon (CNN) He was an old man who spent his days alone in the mountains of southern Oregon looking for a bee. He hadn't seen the bee -- no one had seen this particular bee species -- in 10 years when he asked me to join him.

It was August, the last breath of summer bee season. Robbin Thorp, then 82, a retired entomologist from University of California-Davis, wore a safari hat, tinted bifocals and a T-shirt with an image of Franklin's bumblebee printed on the chest. That black-and-yellow bee, which looks like so many others except for the characteristic ""U"" on its back, is the object of Thorp's obsession. It's a creature he told me flies through his dreams, always just out of reach.

Finding it -- believing it can be found -- is what brings him to this spot 6,400 feet above sea level, near the base of a ski lift, even though his gait is wobbly now and these craggy, alpine ravines could break a 20-something hip.

Franklin's bumblebee is a species other scientists fear extinct. But Thorp will barely entertain that idea.

""When things are rare, they're really, really hard to find,"" he told me.

Thorp can be matter of fact like that.

And so the old man keeps looking, bee net in one hand and ""bee vacuum"" in the other. He walks from one flower to the next, inspecting the pollinators. If he sees one that might be Franklin's he'll slurp it into the bee vacuum, which looks like a child's water gun. Then he closely inspects it: ""Just another one of the common bumblebees.""

He does this on his own time and for no pay, usually alone.

Day after day, year after year.

It's almost like something out of Hemingway: The old man and the bee.

I'll admit that when I met Thorp on August 8, 2016, the day before the 10-year anniversary of his last sighting of Franklin's bumblebee, which occurred on that very slope, I had my doubts about his quest. To me, the bee hunt seemed like a Sisyphean task. That's because scientists say we are entering a new age of mass extinction. Species are disappearing at something like 100 times the normal rate, and biologists fear three-quarters of all species could disappear in the next couple centuries if we don't stop polluting the atmosphere and bulldozing habitat.

In that context, it's hard not to see Thorp as an old man living in an old world, one where a species reasonably can be expected to survive one year to the next.

We don't live in that world anymore.

But after two days with Thorp I realized that he's on to something.

It's precisely when we stop looking for species that we allow them to vanish.

'WOAHDUDE'

I'm sure by now you've read something about bees being in trouble. Maybe you've heard of ""colony collapse disorder,"" or perhaps there's a do-gooder on your Facebook page who is raising a beehive in her yard and takes way too many selfies in a Space-Age suit.

All of that barely scratches the surface of the trouble bees face.

There are roughly 20,000 species of bees in the world -- that's more than birds or amphibians or reptiles or mammals -- and the Western honey bee, the one you usually hear about, the one that lives in big, social hives and is domesticated to produce honey -- is just one of those species.

To get a sense of what the other 19,999 are like, it helps to talk to Sam Droege, a researcher at the US Geological Survey's Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab in Maryland. Droege spends his days taking super-high-resolution photos of dead bee specimens, some of which come from natural history museums and others that are pulled from field research. One benefit of the work is that it provides a detailed catalog of species, in case they disappear.

But the photos are also just really freaking cool -- in that way potheads can appreciate. Some of the images first got popular on a stoner-themed subpage of the website reddit. The page is called ""WOAHDUDE."" Droege's daughter brought that to his attention, ""Why was my daughter looking at the stoner subreddit, I don't know!,"" he told a documentary film crew

Take a look at a few of the images:

We're losing this diversity fast.

So that's the stoner argument for why bees matter.

Here's the self-interested one: Bees help pollinate 35% of the world's food, and bumblebees, of which Franklin's bumblebee is (or was) one, pollinate everything from tomatoes to cranberries and blueberries and melons. Yet they live in underground colonies, caring for a queen. And they don't make honey, so you don't hear as much about them from journalists.

Sarina Jepsen, deputy chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's bumblebee specialist group, and a director at the Xerces Society, an environmental nonprofit, told me about 25% of bumblebees in North America are at risk for extinction. ""If you think about it, that's a really strikingly high percentage of a fauna to be declining -- and in some cases really crashing,"" said Leif Richardson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics.

And much of the vanishing is undocumented.

""It's abysmal what we know right now,"" Droege, from USGS, told me.

""There are just too few people on the ground looking.""

'It was just gone'

Robbin Thorp started looking for Franklin's bumblebee in the 1960s. He'd taken an entomology course at the University of Michigan and got hooked on the invisible insect world. It's an obsession that was, from the start, both personal and professional. He told me his first wife did not love the fact that he kept stacks of insect eggs and other specimens in their apartment.

""She was not a naturalist,"" he said, laughing. ""But she put up with it.""

In 1998, he began to study Franklin's bumblebee in earnest.

In part, he was interested in whether the bee should be listed under the Endangered Species Act. But he also just wanted to know what this bee was all about. Why did it live only in northern California and southern Oregon when so many other bee species had wider ranges? Which flowers did it prefer? Which plants and potentially crops would be lost without it?

Back then, the bee was relatively abundant -- not the most common, but far from the least. ""I could walk down and see (Franklin's bumblebee) on every patch of flowers,"" he told me.

""I'd see 15, 20 of 'em in just a short distance.""

A year or two later, the bee became more difficult to find.

Then all of a sudden: ""It was just gone.""

Thorp's work shifted from what-is-this-bee-up-to to where-the-hell-did-it-go. The bee scientist, in a sense, became a detective. Who or what could have killed Franklin's bumblebee?

Thorp hoped finding it might offer some clues.

'There's something flying!'

I met Thorp on a cool, clear morning in the parking lot at the base of Oregon's Mount Ashland Ski Area. You could see California's Mount Shasta from this altitude. I worry about meeting people for the first time -- whether I'll know who they are and all that. But identifying Thorp was no trouble at all. White truck, bumblebee sticker on tailgate. Yep, that's him.

His treasured bee, however, proved much harder to pick out of a crowd.

We drove 15 minutes or so down a gravel road toward the meadow where Thorp last spotted Franklin's bumblebee, on August 9, 2006, a date he recites from memory. When we stopped, Thorp pulled a little wooden box out of the back of his pickup and opened it.

Inside, rows of dead bees with pins stuck through them.

""These are Franklin's,"" he said, pointing to three of them. ""A queen, a worker and a male.""

Shaky handwriting dated the specimens: ""1950.""

The trouble: Franklin's bee looked like so many others in the box. Thorp told me Franklin's is distinguished by its ""round black face"" -- ""some of the others have a very long face,"" he said -- and by a U-shaped black marking on its back, near the wings. ""You're going to be seeing a lot of these,"" Thorp said, pointing to the Yellow-Faced Bumblebee, which, true to name, has a yellow face (as does Franklin's) and a distinguishing yellow stripe on its abdomen.

None of this helped me much. I drew a few pictures in my notebook -- jotted down these descriptions and pretended I could tell all of these seemingly identical bees apart.

""There's something flying!"" Thorp said, pointing to a bee that buzzed right by my leg.

""It's probably headed for the flowers.""

Apparently, so were we.

'That's a fly'

To find bees, Thorp told me, you start with the flowers.

If you know something about bumblebees and what they're up to -- I didn't, Thorp did -- this makes sense. Bumblebees serve a queen, which is buried in a den beneath the ground. Worker bees -- females that don't reproduce because they're not the queen -- fly around during the day collecting flower pollen and nectar for food and energy.

They carry the pollen back to the nest in saddle bags, which look like little orange or yellow (it depends on the pollen) footballs taped to their legs. I asked Thorp if this was the origin of the phrase ""the bee's knees."" Sorry to report: It's not. He did tell me, however, that all of these bumblebees, except the queen, die each year. The queen hibernates through the winter alone, producing the next year's generation.

It's a risky life cycle, and it's one reason Thorp is so concerned about Franklin's, which, by the way, is named for a researcher, not Benjamin Franklin.

Another fun bumblebee fact: Females sting, males don't.

To prove the point, Thorp slurped a male from the air with his bee vacuum --

ZEEEEEEEEP!

-- and put the poor guy in my hand.

""It's kind of like a cell phone on buzz mode,"" he said.

That's exactly how it felt.

That buzz -- which is much stronger on a bumblebee than other bees -- is what shakes pollen off of flowers, helping them reproduce. Bumblebees pollinate crops other bees can't.

Some bees have evolved to pollinate very-specific plants. Franklin's bumblebee can pollinate many things, Thorp told me, but it tends to prefer two plants: a mini-mum-looking flower called yellow buckwheat; and a purplish blossom commonly called coyote mint, but which Thorp calls ""monardella."" We set our sights on those flowers and continued scanning the field.

The trouble: These flowers were everywhere.

Notebook in hand, I started testing my bee-ID skills.

I pointed at a bee I thought, stupidly, might be Franklin's.

""This also has a yellow face but it's shaggier looking,"" he said.

I'd never thought of bees as ""shaggy"" before.

""Which one is that?"" I asked.

""That's a fly.""

500 million butterflies

The precise location where Thorp saw Franklin's bumblebee in 2006 is on a steep slope, past a clump of trees and slightly below the Pacific Crest Trail, the famous hiking path.

Unlike me, Thorp can identify bees in a split second. He knew instantly that this was Franklin's bumblebee, which he hadn't seen in three years at that point. He saw it zip down the meadow, across what now is a field of yellow buckwheat, and toward a soggy ravine.

Thorp was 72 then.

Still, he ran downhill after the bee.

He never caught it.

And he remains mystified by its disappearance.

That's because the usual bee killers don't make total sense for Franklin's.

There are a number of reasons for the crash of pollinators bees worldwide. Mainly, they are habitat loss ( nearly 40% of all land is used for agriculture , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization), climate change (the land that's left is changing, and this is shrinking the ranges of some bees) and rampant chemical use.

You may remember seeing images of millions of dead bees in South Carolina earlier this year. Officials sprayed insecticide in hopes of killing mosquitoes that could transmit the Zika virus. Millions of honeybees became unintended casualties. More pervasive, though, are pesticides and herbicides, which are routinely sprayed on crops like corn. More than 500 million monarch butterflies have disappeared since 1997 , according to the Center for Biological Diversity. That's partly because herbicide use has killed off much of their habitat, the group says, noting that a Texas sized chunk of monarch habitat has been lost in the last 20 years.

Some researchers fear their epic migration is in jeopardy.

Franklin's bumblebee, meanwhile, seems to live on a pristine, alpine meadow, with few people around and no crops that I saw. Its historic range only includes California and Oregon. Climate change is mangling so many things in the natural world it's difficult to tease out its effect everywhere -- but Thorp suspected a totally different culprit.

To understand it, you need to take a quick trip with me.

'Caution: Bumblebees at work'

There's a shiny pool of disinfectant by the door to the greenhouse at Windset Farms in British Columbia, about 600 miles up the Pacific Coast from Mount Ashland.

Two ominous signs are stuck to the door.

""Warning: Strict biosecurity measures in effect.""

""Caution: Bumblebees at work.""

I got a tour from Ron Moes, a senior grower at Windset, which grows tomatoes and a host of other crops in greenhouses that seem big enough to contain neighborhoods.

I was interested in the farm because it hires commercial bees -- raised in factories some 2,000 miles away and then flown way out here.

""When we get the bees, they come in a box like this,"" Moes told me, pointing to what looked to be a box for legal files. Except that it had a bunch of bees buzzing around inside.

""When I started, we pollinated everything by hand,"" he said. ""We manually went around with the -- we call it a vibrator -- and we would touch every flower and pollinate."" Now that the greenhouse has hired commercial bees, an industry that developed in the late 1990s, the process is more efficient and cheaper. ""They're great workers,"" Moes said. ""They put in a lot of time. They basically go from sunup to sunset, and they basically work seven days a week.""

Aside from the postapocalyptic feel of the place -- the bees are raised only for mass production and their colonies are incinerated after eight weeks of work -- perhaps there is nothing wrong with hiring bees for their pollination services. They can pollinate better than a ""vibrator"" -- so let them do their thing, right? But Thorp and other researchers are concerned about diseases that can spread anytime you have a bunch of homogenous livestock -- or bees -- in one place.

Thorp fears greenhouse diseases, perhaps one called Nosema, infected wild bee populations -- and helped lead to the rapid decline of Franklin's bumblebee.

Moes told me Windset takes ample precautions to prevent that sort of thing from happening. Aside from incinerating the hives, they trap queen bees inside the boxes permanently so that she can't start new colonies. The greenhouse is disinfected regularly, he said.

Still, there are open panels in the ceiling of the greenhouse. And while Moes told me these bees have no interest in leaving so many pollination-ready tomato crops, it does seem possible one or two could sneak out. It's enough of a concern that conservationists like Jepsen, at the Xerces Society in Portland, want stiffer, disease-minded regulation of the commercial bee industry. She also wants commercial bees to only be local species, instead of shipped around the globe.

'What's the value of this?'

Whatever the cause, Thorp is understandably alarmed by Franklin's bumblebee's disappearance. And he's sure humans are behind it somehow.

As I walked up and down the meadows of Oregon with Thorp looking for this impossible-to-find insect, I thought about how we know so very little about the natural world. We live in concrete cities, deal only with managed forms of nature -- farms, lawns, medians.

In a generation or two, will there be any Robbin Thorps left?

Will anyone notice species like Franklin's are disappearing?

Maybe it seems like this doesn't matter -- it's just one bee. Others will pick up the slack of pollinating wildflowers, and we have factory bees to pollinate fruits and vegetables now.

To that, I'd offer two arguments.

One is that farmers in part of China now have to pollinate apple crops by hand because wild bee populations have vanished entirely. True, the crop isn't gone. But what does that say about us?

For the second, I'll give the floor to Thorp.

I asked him to name the question about Franklin's that bothers him most.

""I guess the question that irks me the most is, 'What's the value of this?'""

Meaning, what's the economic value of this species.

He hates that question because, yes, pollination services from nature are valued at billions per year, and, yes, the grocery store would look much sadder without bees and other pollinators.

But that's missing the bigger truth.

""I don't think you can put an economic value on a species,"" he told me, sitting in that meadow in Oregon he's returned to so many times since 2006. ""To me they're all valuable. They're all priceless really ... Franklin's is one that I've had a lot of personal investment in, in many ways. And, yeah, I feel an attachment and kinship to it.""

Can you imagine what the world would be like if we all thought that way?

We might not be on the verge of the sixth mass extinction in Earth's history -- something of dinosaur-ending magnitude. Anthony Barnosky, an expert on this from Stanford University, told me humans have about 20 years max to shape up before this mass extinction becomes inevitable. And by mass extinction he means three-quarters of all known species would be lost.

Franklin's bumblebee should be a wake-up call -- a window into a dystopian future.

It certainly was for me.

'Honeybee on buckwheat'

I wasted the first day-and-a-half I spent with Thorp wondering what keeps this old man looking for this lost bee. It must be extinct, I thought. Give up.

But then, somehow, I got hooked on this quest.

The more I looked for Franklin's bumblebee, the more I learned about this meadow in Oregon, the rich lattice of flowers, bees, ferns and the like that make it wonderful and unique. And the more I learned the more I wanted to believe that Franklin's bumblebee might still be out there -- somewhere, against all odds.

I know that probably sounds silly, but Thorp's endless vat of hope is infectious. If we're going to beat the sixth extinction, we have to believe it's possible. We need to believe species like Franklin's bumblebee matter.

We should be pissed off they're missing.

Late in the afternoon, I left Thorp and walked off on my own path.

Thorp mutters notes into a voice recorder while he walks through the mountains looking for bees -- listing the flowers and the insects. I decided to try the same, speaking notes to my phone.

""Honeybee on buckwheat. Yellow-faced whatever on buckwheat.""

""There's a big patch of this mint stuff that Franklin's bumblebee likes. It's kinda purple. Yellow faced bumblebee -- looks like -- just flew up. It's buzzing one of those flowers. I guess it's good there are bees here at all, but these are NOT the bees I'm looking for.""

""There's just this buzzing sound all around you. It kinda makes you insane.""

I got so into it that I actually started talking to the bees.

""Do you guys know where Franklin is?""

We never found it.

I was crushed.

Thorp was disappointed but hopeful.

And as long as he can walk, he told me, he will continue the search.",2016-12-11 00:00:00
Sixth extinction: 20 years to stop ecological collapse,"Story highlights John Sutter: The Earth's next mass extinction -- the first caused by people -- is on the horizon Three-fourths of species could vanish, unless we take preventive steps, he says

Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and email. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) —

The Earth’s next mass extinction – the first caused by people – is on the horizon. And the consequences are almost unthinkably dire: Three-quarters of species could disappear.

This has happened only five times in the planet’s history – including the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs.

What’s different now is that humans are causing these changes.

How? Well, we’re burning fossil fuels and consequently heating up the planet; turning massive chunks of land into farms; spreading invasive species and diseases around the world; boosting our own numbers and consuming more and more resources; and causing all sorts of trouble for the oceans, from overfishing to filling them up with plastic. (Did you know researchers expect the ocean to be equal parts fish and plastic, by weight, as soon as 2050?)

This subject certainly is alarming, especially when you consider the global picture.

Another frightening data point in this trend toward extinction emerged on Thursday in a report from the World Wildlife Fund, an environmental advocacy group. The report claims 58% declines in certain vertebrate animal populations since 1970 and says that if trends continue, then two-thirds of all of these individual birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals will be gone by 2020.

Some scientists see those numbers as potentially misleading. Stuart Pimm, the Doris Duke chair of conservation ecology at Duke University, told me that 58% is “a fairly silly kind of number to report because it mixes what’s going on in the ocean with what’s going on in the land.” He continued, “It mixes studies of bird populations in Europe with mammal populations in Africa. It has very few data points in South America. The idea that you in the media can only handle a single number to summarize the state of the planet – you should be insulted by that.”

I agree with Pimm that these numbers can be misleading, but that’s only if people misunderstand them. I also spoke with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford University. He told me the most important thing to remember is that this report is limited in scope – it has little data from some important tropical regions, for example, and only covers animals with backbones. But it highlights an important and little-considered fact: It’s not just that species are going extinct at an alarming rate – at least 100 times what could be considered “normal,” and maybe much higher than that – but that populations of still-common animals are declining very rapidly.

“I don’t think I would quibble with the trend they’re pointing out – we’re losing individuals of species and geographic ranges at a really rapid rate,” he told me. “If you keep that up, extinction of lots of species is inevitable.”

Importantly, the WWF report deals with individual animals disappearing, not with entire species.

A mass extinction, by definition, means three-quarters of all species disappear.

That could happen in 100 or 200 years, Barnosky said, but not by 2020.

Don’t look at that figure and think we have time to count our blessings. Barnosky told me we have maybe 10 to 20 years to stop the sixth extinction from becoming an inevitability. If we do nothing, expect three-quarters of species to disappear over the next century or two. In other words, what we do (or don’t do) right now will shape generations on this planet.

“Yes, species are going extinct very, very much faster than they should be,” Pimm said, “which means we are depriving countless generations to come the extremely rich diversity we inherited from our parents.”

And others experts, including Paul Ehrlich, the Bing professor of population studies at Stanford University, say the sixth extinction is already here.

“We’ve probably lost, say, 200 species – kinds of big animals – over the last couple of hundred years, but we may well have lost on the order of a billion different populations,” he said. “We are basically annihilating the life on our planet and that is the only known life we know about in the entire universe. And it’s life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. And it’s life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don’t have the diversity of other organisms, we’re done.”

Pimm told me we have “about a human generation” to do something before it’s likely too late.

“If we don’t start doing a lot of things to stop extinction, we are going to see very significant losses of species,” he said. “There are a lot of things we can do and I would rather concentrate on the positive (rather) than just wallow in this really appalling number” presented by the World Wildlife Fund.

“In the last 50 years, roughly, we’ve lost 50% of the individuals in these species,” Barnosky said. “If we lose another 50% in the next 50 years we’re down to 25% of the original. Basically, in a couple hundred years you’d have almost all of these species we’re talking about blinking out – if we keep going at that rate.”

We know how to slow the rate of extinction. We need to ditch fossil fuels to blunt climate change. We need to protect more of the land and ocean on behalf of biodiversity. (The biologist E.O. Wilson has called for half of the world to be protected, a bold and exciting proposition.) We need to stop the spread of invasive species, and we’ve got to get a handle on illegal trades like that in ivory, which Barnosky said could wipe out Africa’s elephants in 20 years if poaching rates continue.

The first step, however, is waking up to the crisis and its monstrous scope.

“The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction,” he told me earlier this year, “is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone.”

I’d rather imagine a world where we stop anything close to that from happening.",2016-10-27 00:00:00
How to stop the sixth mass extinction,"Scientists warn the Earth is entering the sixth mass extinction. Three quarters of all species could vanish.

(CNN) —

The Earth is on the verge of a mass extinction event.

To understand how big of a deal that is you don’t have to look much further than the definition of “mass extinction.” It means that three-quarters of all species vanish – forever.

In all of history, that’s happened only five times.

The sixth extinction would be the first caused by humans.

“We are basically annihilating the life on our planet – and that is the only known life … in the entire universe,” said Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor of population studies at Stanford University.

“It’s life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It’s life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don’t have the diversity of other organisms, we’re done.”

I’ve been reporting on the coming extinction crisis this year for a CNN series called “Vanishing.” And I can tell you that while this topic is enormously depressing, there is some good news: We know how to slow or hopefully stop the sixth extinction.

Anthony Barnosky, another extinction expert, also from Stanford, told me humans have at most 20 years to make sweeping changes about our relationship with nature. If we do that, he said, we can avoid the sixth extinction.

But here’s what needs to happen, according to the experts.

1. Stop burning fossil fuels

06:08 - Source: CNN If coral reefs disappear, so will they

Burning fossil fuels and chopping down rainforests is heating up the atmosphere. That’s creating trouble for all corners of the natural world, from the Rocky Mountains, where the tiny pika is overheating, to the oceans, where coral reefs are being decimated as the oceans warm and become more acidic.

We know that to avert the worst of climate change we need to limit warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius. To do that, the world needs to be off fossil fuels this century – hopefully closer to 2030 than 2100. That’s a tall order, but Stanford University researchers have shown we can do it with existing technology like wind, solar and nuclear.

Policies that promote cleaner energy include carbon taxes, cap-and-trade pollution pricing systems and renewable energy tax credits. The Paris Agreement on climate change, ratified by the United States and 115 other countries, also creates a framework for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels. The Trump administration in the United States, however, threatens to move the world’s second-biggest climate polluter away from that agreement and back towards dirty, climate-warming fuels.

2. Protect half the Earth’s land – and oceans

05:04 - Source: CNN The old man and the bee

This idea comes from renowned biologist E.O. Wilson: Put aside half the surface of the Earth – both land and oceans – for the betterment of the nature and biodiversity. Maybe that sounds like a lot, but Wilson argues it’s necessary if we want to avert crisis. Some 84% of species could be saved if we protected all that land. “That amount, as I and others have shown, can be put together from large and small fragments around the world to remain relatively natural, without removing people living there or changing property rights,” Wilson wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times.

The trouble: We’re not protecting nearly enough, according to experts. Currently, only 15% of land and 4% of the world’s oceans are protected from encroachment by humans, mostly in the form of farms. Already, people have used up nearly 40% of the world’s land for farms and raising livestock – much of it to grow feed for cattle. Eating less meat – or going vegetarian – uses less land (and is far better for the climate; beef is an especially big polluter).

3. Fight illegal wildlife trafficking

05:49 - Source: CNN Iconic African elephant population on the brink

Some of the world’s most iconic species – particularly the elephant and rhino – are threatened with extinction simply because people are slaughtering these majestic creatures to sell their body parts on the black market. Elephant ivory is carved into trinkets. And rhino horn is mistakenly sold as an aphrodisiac.

And there are other less-known markets, too, including those for pangolin meat (a delicacy), giraffe tails (bracelets) and tiger bone (medicine). Efforts to shut down these markets have been grossly inadequate, as the black market in environmental products is estimated to be worth $91 billion to $258 billion per year. Compare that to drug trafficking, the most lucrative black market, which is worth $344 billion per year, according to a United Nations and Interpol estimate.

Experts say better law enforcement is needed to stop poaching. And consumers – especially those in Asia, where wildlife products tend to be popular – need to stop buying these illegal and harmful goods. Groups like WildAid and Education for Nature Vietnam are using advertising campaigns to try to make these products seem uncool.

4. Slow human population growth

05:17 - Source: CNN The birds on this island eat plastic

It sounds callous, but more people means more food, more land and more resources. Ehrlich, from Stanford, said population growth is one of the main drivers of the Earth’s extinction crisis. The population was about 4 billion in 1980. It’s now 7.4 billion and is rapidly heading for 9.7 billion by 2050, according to the United Nations.

There are ways for each person to conserve, of course. The World Bank says the average American, for example, produces about 10 times as much climate-change pollution per year as an average person from India. And we needlessly use resources we know are harmful. Plastics, for example, are clogging the world’s oceans. We dump the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic into the ocean each minute, according to the World Economic Forum. Some researchers expect there to be more plastic than fish in the ocean, by weight, by the year 2050. That’s almost unthinkable.

5. Reconnect with the natural world, and open our eyes

05:40 - Source: CNN He can hear species disappearing

If there’s a fact that underlies all this, perhaps it’s this: We’re no longer connected to nature. We don’t understand it and therefore, naively, dangerously, we figure it’s doing just fine or will rebound. Barnosky, the extinction expert from Stanford, said we think of the natural world like a bottomless checking account when we need to see it as a savings account.

We humans also have ridiculously short attention spans. Issues like extinction and climate change play out over decades, centuries and millennia. Our actions now – or inaction – will matter for thousands of years. “You can have catastrophic events that are seen in slow motion, basically, and not register on people very well,” said Ehrlich. We must find a way to reconnect with nature and to see this wave of extinction for the crisis that it is.

"At 87, her mission to help immigrants hasn’t slowed down","(CNN) —

Florence Phillips was born in New York to Jewish parents who fled Europe before the Holocaust.

Growing up, she experienced first-hand the burden of being a child of immigrants who didn’t speak English. Helping her parents interact with the outside world fell on her shoulders.

Laura Klairmont/CNN CNN Hero Florence Phillips

“I did all the translations for them,” Phillips said. “I saw how they struggled being new to a country and not knowing the language.”

For most of her life, Phillips worked various desk jobs. Then, in her late-50s, she enlisted in the Peace Corps. She served three tours—in Kenya, Guatemala and Jamaica—working on community-building projects and teaching English.

After returning to the US in 1999, at age 69, Phillips realized there were countless people in her own backyard in need of her support.

“It came to me that I didn’t have to leave the US or my hometown to help. I could do here what I did overseas,” she said.

She became an AmeriCorps volunteer and moved around the country, eventually settling in Carson City, Nevada. There, immigrants make up roughly one in five of the state’s population. Phillips met many adult immigrants who were struggling to learn English.

To address the need, she started the ESL In-Home Program of Northern Nevada, a nonprofit that provides free ESL (English as a Second Language), citizenship, GED and computer classes.

Since its inception in 2004, the nonprofit has helped more than 5,000 immigrants and their families.

Today, at 87 years old—when most people are deep in retirement—Phillips shows no signs of winding down.

CNN’s Laura Klairmont spoke with Phillips about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What are some of the barriers that get in the way of immigrants accessing English classes?

Florence Phillips: It was amazing to see how many immigrants there were that wanted to learn English. I got calls from all over Nevada. Many of these immigrants could not attend ESL classes because the schools and other organizations have a set schedule, and their times were not convenient for the student who works three jobs. So, my program teaches morning, noon, night, weekends, holidays. We provide these services at the times and days that the student is available and wherever the student is or can be. My program is very flexible.

We teach English on all levels to immigrants and refugees in Northern Nevada who want to learn. There is no other program like this in the state. We give the students personal attention; I match them with a tutor. We teach at no cost to the student.

03:33 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: American Dreams

There are people who were living in rural counties and in other counties where they did not have transportation if there was a class available for them to go to. If they lack transportation, just had a baby, are sick or disabled, we will tutor in their own homes or the tutor’s home.

CNN: Your program also provides free classes that help people prepare for their citizenship test.

Phillips: It is a very difficult test. A lot of Americans say they could not pass. These people have to know the answers to questions about the branches of government, how many senators there are, etc. It’s a lot of history, a lot of civics, a lot about our government. They have to know how to write, how to read. They have to know how to converse in English with the interviewer. We do all of that for them. We have a mock interview at the end of the class so that they know what to expect when they go for their exam. It takes a commitment of coming to a 12-week class. It takes a lot of memorization.

To apply for citizenship today, it costs more than $700. Many of our students cannot afford to apply. So, we help to raise money to help these students apply.

Whether they’re working two, three jobs, they have to sit down and study every single day, and they make that commitment because it is their desire to become an American. My students inspire me because of their dedication, their commitment, their motivation to learn.

CNN: How has your work affected the lives of your students?

Phillips: I have students that were promoted to be supervisor. I get students who call me and say, “I was able to talk with the teacher about my child.” And I’m being told by the students that they went to the market and the clerk understood them. Those are the rewards I get as they progress.

My students love this country. They are very proud about being here, learning English, learning our culture. I see the pride when they say, “I am an American.”

"Locked up and learning to write, women prisoners find a safe space","(CNN) —

Ellen Stackable has been an English teacher for more than 20 years.

“I just fell in love with the idea that writing could change someone’s life,” she said.

Meghan Dunn/CNN CNN Hero Ellen Stackable

While working on her graduate school thesis in 2013, she stumbled upon a topic that would change hers.

Stackable learned that her home state of Oklahoma has the highest rate of female incarceration in the country – and it has held this record for more than 25 years.

“We have harsh sentencing laws, and we’re locking up so many women,” she said. “I couldn’t believe what was going on in my state.”

In 2014, she decided to bring creative writing classes to incarcerated women. Her nonprofit, Poetic Justice, started in one location. Now the program is in five female prisons in Oklahoma.

As Stackable began meeting the women in prison, she learned many of them were first-time, non-violent offenders. She began to hear their stories and learn about their difficult lives.

“These women have been failed by everyone,” Stackable said. “They have childhood trauma; many have been sexually abused or experienced domestic violence. When you learn what they’ve been through, you understand how they found their way to prison.”

During the weekly Poetic Justice classes, the women meditate, learn about poetry and creative writing, brainstorm and then spend time writing. Volunteers help prompt ideas and provide individual attention. At the end of class, the women can share their work with one another.

When people read what these women have written, they are blown away. CNN Hero Ellen Stackable

“It’s a sacred place where you can write, and you can feel free to share your writing and trust people in a place where no one trusts anybody,” Stackable said. “In a place that never feels safe, you make a safe place.”

At the end of the eight-week course, each woman receives a printed book containing a collection of their group’s work.

“When people read what these women have written, they are blown away,” Stackable said. “Everyone assumes they’re in prison, so they must be dumb. But they are talented, creative and incredible writers.”

For Stackable – whose group has reached more than 2,500 women – this is about much more than writing. She views these courses as a therapeutic way for the women to work through past trauma and find healing.

“I see these women gain self-confidence and find self-worth,” she said. “I just want them to find hope. If they can find hope, it can change their lives.”

CNN’s Meghan Dunn spoke with Stackable about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What inspired you to bring writing to these women?

Stackable: I wanted something that I felt like wasn’t just me reaching down and giving somebody something, but giving them a tool and a way that they could change and empower themselves.

Once they find out they can write, no one’s ever going to be able to take that away. The only true freedom they have to hold is within themselves, because everything else can be taken away from them. So, writing becomes really infinitely more powerful for them.

CNN: What changes have you seen in them?

Stackable: I see women being restored to their families. I see them making a difference in other prisoners’ lives. I see them changing the atmosphere within prison. And I think that writing is part of that. But underlying writing is a sense of self-worth and employment and agency. To have those things while you’re in prison is just counter to the entire system.

CNN: You start each new class with the women setting the rules.

Stackable: I think in order to know that you matter, you have to feel like you have a choice in something. So, everything that we do in the class is to eliminate the hierarchy these women have always been part of. They’ve always been the bottom of it, and even more so in prison. So, we allow them to make the rules.

Creating a safe place in the most unsafe place is at the heart of what we do. And from that, writing flows easily. And then with writing comes healing and hope and change.

CNN: What keeps you motivated?

Stackable: I think, ultimately, it’s because these women are worth it. They matter. I walk away from every class I teach encouraged and just honored to be there.

There’s no coincidence that prisons are often in out-of-the-way rural places. It’s because we don’t want to see them. We don’t want to know what’s happening. So, for me to be able to tell their story and for them to tell their story, that’s the motivation.

Dog lover flies ‘paw-sengers’ to safety,"(CNN) —

Paul Steklenski has saved more than 1,000 dogs’ lives in the last three years.

Twice a month, the Army veteran loads about 15 animals on to a small plane and flies them from high-kill shelters in the southern US to rescue groups up north.

CNN CNN Hero Paul Steklenski

“These animals are perfectly fine and healthy and adoptable – (they) just can’t get out of kill shelters to that freedom,” Steklenski said. “They are getting a private flight to save their lives.”

His efforts – and the need – led him to start his nonprofit, Flying Fur Animal Rescue, in 2015. But this mission was never something he’d set out to do.

In 2013, Steklenski began working at a company closer to his home, which led him to the idea of becoming a pilot.

“I started driving to my new job, and I would pass this small airfield,” said Steklenski, a network engineer. “I don’t know why, but I just decided one day to go in and sign up for flying lessons.”

While training to get his pilot license, his family decided to adopt a dog. The process opened his eyes to a world he didn’t know existed.

“You learn about this huge underground railroad of people who volunteer their time, money, and energy to get these animals out of kill shelters,” Steklenski said. “I became so aware and more compassionate to all animals.”

He got his license a few months later and realized he could do more than fly for recreation.

“I thought, this is a way I can use an ability I have to help move a large amount of animals in a short amount of time,” he said.

Since starting the organization, Steklenski has completed nearly 100 flights to save animals, all paid for out of his own pocket. The organization now has its own plane and transports to rescue groups in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

“We’re only in the plane for a short period of time, but that time is so precious to me,” he said. “There are moments we share in that plane that I will never forget.”

CNN’s Meghan Dunn spoke with Steklenski about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What did you learn about the need in rescuing these animals?

Paul Steklenski: There is a huge need to help get animals out of kill shelters. I learned that if they don’t get out of certain areas of this country, they don’t live. The further South you get, the worse it gets. And there are so many organizations up north that are no-kill that will take these animals.

Once I became an airman, it was natural. Knowing that I could take a day off from work and quite literally help save the lives of a dozen or more animals just by doing this, that was it. I didn’t need to know any more.

CNN: What’s it like to be on such a small plane with more than a dozen dogs?

Steklenski: Every dog that steps foot on our plane is a ‘paw-senger.’ I’ll look to who is the most scared or the most terrified and know that if I put them next to me, they’ll be calmed. A lot of times depending on the size of my copilot, he’ll kind of shimmy over, and get on my lap and fall asleep.

01:09 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: Top Dog

Usually once the engine starts up, they hear the noise and the vibration – everybody settles in. Some will look out the window or they’ll fall asleep. It’s usually a non-event. It’s preferable to flying with people in a lot of ways!

But it’s bittersweet in the sense that you’ve got to spend maybe two hours with them, and they start to bond with you a little bit, and now they’re moving on. It’s just what you have to do; they have to move on to their next step.

CNN: You dedicate a lot of time to flying animals. How do you juggle it with your full-time job?

Steklenski: My full-time job helps pay for this. I spend over $1,000 a month out of my pocket to do this. I need my job to fulfill these missions and help save these animals.

When I look back in time, when I was renting airplanes all the time and had to drive an hour to the airport with crates in my truck – I look back now, I’m like, “Wow, you were nuts.” It’s just not something you really focus on. You’re focused on what the next mission is, what’s the next group of dogs I need to help. When it’s something you’re very passionate about, I don’t think you really measure the amount of energy or time or sacrifice you put into it. You just do it.

CNN: What’s the future of the organization look like?

Steklenski: The future of Flying Fur is take us to the next level and get a dedicated farm in Pennsylvania with an airstrip that I can fly animals into directly, where we can have an intake and adoption and rehab center.

I also want to upgrade our aircraft to something bigger that can go further. I don’t know how I’m going to get there yet, and it’s going to take a lot of money. But that’s my challenge. I’ve made it this far in three years. It’s on my shoulders now to figure out how to get us to where we need to be.

She makes sure unwanted food gets to hungry Americans,"(CNN) —

Maria Rose Belding grew up working in her church’s food pantry in her small Iowa hometown.

“Jesus said, ‘For I was hungry and you fed me.’ … Stacking cans was my answer to this call,” Belding said.

As she got older, Belding realized that feeding the hungry wasn’t as easy as it should be. The pantry’s shelves overflowed with some items while other foods were desperately needed.

In 2009, when she was 14, the pantry received a huge donation of macaroni and cheese that was more than the community could use, and she saw how hard it was to contact other charities that could take it.

Kathleen Toner/CNN CNN Hero Maria Rose Belding

Months later, she had to throw away hundreds of expired boxes as people waited in line for food.

“I remember just crying and being so angry,” said Belding, now 22. “There was nothing that really allowed us to communicate in an efficient way. … The Internet was right in front of us!”

Belding had stumbled upon two problems that still plague the U.S. food system. According to the USDA, more than 40 million Americans don’t regularly have enough to eat while up to 40% of the country’s food supply is wasted.

In high school, she developed an idea for an online database that could solve both problems, but she didn’t have the programming skills to make it work. After graduating, she met Grant Nelson, a law student who was writing code on his laptop.

About nine months later, during Belding’s freshman year at American University, they launched MEANS, a free online platform that connects businesses with extra food to charities that feed the hungry.

Run largely by high school and college students, the nonprofit has helped redistribute more than 1.8 million pounds of food since 2015.

“Too often, grocery stores and restaurants find themselves throwing out food when there is great need in nearby communities,” Belding said. “MEANS aims to make it easier to donate food than throw it in the dumpster. … We’re like a bridge that hasn’t existed before.”

CNN spoke to Belding about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What does MEANS stand for, and how does it work?

Maria Rose Belding: MEANS is an acronym that stands for Matching Excess And Need for Stability; 14-year-old me had a fondness for acronyms.

It’s pretty simple. If you want to get food from MEANS, you have to be registered as a legal charity in the United States. So, when a soup kitchen, homeless shelter or a food pantry needs something, they tell our system. And when a grocery store, caterer or food retailer has something they want to donate, all they have to do is go online and say, “This is where I am, this is what I’ve got, and this is when I need it gone by.” Then the system automatically notifies all of those who have said, “I need things within these parameters.” We’re able to match up excess and need very, very quickly. At this point, MEANS has about 3,000 partners in 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The Emerson Act – a ‘Good Samaritan’ law passed in 1996 – protects donors from liability.

We’re also part of a great partnership with the Rhode Island Health Department called Rhode to End Hunger, which encourages businesses to donate food to nonprofits. One of the shining stars of that is the Twin River Casino. They’ll post hundreds of pounds of food, and somebody in Providence – like McAuley House, which is feeding a lot of folks who are struggling – will claim it really fast. The average in Rhode Island is about 10 minutes for things to move.

CNN: What are some of the most unusual donations you’ve had?

Belding: We’ve got all these awesome stories. People think, “Oh, no one’s going to want that” – we can prove you wrong. We have had 50 pounds of squab – which is fancy baby pigeon – from a five-star restaurant in Seattle. That ended up being used in pork and beans – apparently it was a big hit. We’ve found home for 250 pounds of rutabagas, 11,000 pounds of green beans, 42,000 pounds of milk. We’ll find a home for it 95% of the time. The average amount of time it takes for food to be claimed is half an hour. Our record is two minutes and 37 seconds.

You’d think the novelty would wear off – nope! In our office, every time you see a donation go live on our admin panel, and then you see somebody has claimed it, you’re like, “It worked!” When you see food move, you know that that’s people getting to eat that maybe wouldn’t have been able to – or maybe they’re getting to eat better than they would have. You’re also keeping food from going to landfills. It’s just great for everybody.

CNN: How do you balance running MEANS with being a full-time student?

Belding: Pretty much everybody on our staff is running between classes, labs and work. Our original office was split between my co-founder Grant’s apartment and the basement of my freshman year dorm. Now we’re in the American University Center for Innovation, and this semester my physics class was down the hall, so I literally ran there a minute before class started.

I actually took a year off to devote myself to MEANS full time. Now I am a rising senior and will graduate next May with my pre-medical requirements met. I’m definitely not having a normal college experience. I’ve never been to a Greek life event, I’m not in any clubs, and I know I would have a much better G.P.A. if I wasn’t doing this. But this is more important than me.

What makes it worth it is knowing that we’re building something that matters a lot more than we do.

He quit his high-paying job to build beds for kids who sleep on the floor,"(CNN) —

A simple project to help a family in need stopped Luke Mickelson in his tracks.

Allie Torgan/CNN CNN Hero Luke Mickelson

In 2012, he and his family were inspired to build and donate a bunk bed after learning there were local children who slept on the floor.

“This little girl had a nest of clothes, it looked like a little bird’s nest. And that’s what she slept on, that’s what her bed was,” Mickelson said. “When we delivered the bed, she hugged it and just couldn’t let go.”

Shocked to discover how widespread this need was in his close-knit community, Mickelson founded Sleep in Heavenly Peace, a nonprofit that builds and delivers beds to children in need.

“It was such an eye-opener to me,” he recalled. “I sat there in silence thinking, ‘Is that really what’s going on?’”

Born and raised in Idaho, Mickelson, now 41, was a high school quarterback-turned-family-man. A churchgoer with a thriving career, he coached his kids’ sports teams and fished in the nearby river. But when he met children who were sleeping on the floor, his idyllic life changed course.

“I had no clue about what the need was,” Mickelson said. “There’s kids next door whose parents are struggling just to put food on the table, clothes on their back, a roof over their head. A bed was just a luxury.”

Using safety guidelines and his daughter’s bunk bed as a template, Mickelson started buying wood and supplies to build beds with his own money. He recruited friends and family members to help around the holidays.

As word spread, interest and involvement from his and other communities surged – along with Mickelson’s bunk bed output.

“That first project, we built 11 bunk beds in my garage,” he said. “The next year, we did 15. Then it doubled every year. In 2017, we built 612 bunk beds.”

Mickelson set up a formal charity, complete with training courses, construction manuals and local chapters so communities from coast to coast could join the movement.

With the motto “No kid sleeps on the floor in our town,” the nonprofit and its more than 65 chapters have built and delivered more than 1,500 free beds to children across America.

But along with the rapid growth, Mickelson was faced with a tough choice: advancing his career or his nonprofit. He chose the latter and went from making “great money to zero money.” He’s never looked back.

“I found that the need I have isn’t financial,” he said. “The need I have is seeing the joy on kids’ faces, knowing that I can make a difference.”

CNN’s Allie Torgan spoke with Mickelson about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

02:28 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: How to 'brand' a bed

CNN: Who are your group’s bed recipients?

Luke Mickelson: These kids that we serve in our community come to us from all walks of life. They didn’t get into this situation because of their choices. Often, they take their clothes off at night, put their pajamas on, and sleep on top of their clothes. And then they just repeat that cycle every day.

We have a lot of situations where single parents are escaping an abusive situation. A lot of foster care situations, where parents or grandparents or brothers and sisters are trying to help. A lot of homelessness, people trying to get back on their feet. A $300 or $400 bed is just out of the possibility for them.

CNN: How do they find you?

Mickelson: For someone looking to apply for a bed, they can go to our website and click on “Request a Bed.” Once that application gets filled out, based on the zip code of the recipient, it goes to the closest chapter president, then through a vetting process. Right now, we average over 25 applications a day, nationwide. We don’t have any paid staff right now and we’re growing like a weed. We’re keeping up with that the best we can.

CNN: You quit your job and take no salary from the nonprofit. How do you make ends meet?

Mickelson: I quit my job of 18 years because I wanted to do this full-time, or at least as much as I possibly could, because I knew the need was big. It just came to a point where I could see that my passion really is helping these kids. It was gratifying to see my kids and my family be involved with it and help them learn the value of service, but also seeing everybody else feel and see that joy from helping kids get off the floor. It’s contagious.

I was very fortunate to have another company offer me a job. Granted, I took a huge pay cut, but it helps me get by and helps me do what I need to do with Sleep in Heavenly Peace. They’re very understanding of what my passion is.

CNN: How do the children react to their new beds?

Mickelson: When we deliver a bed, that’s where the rubber meets the road. We make sure that they understand that, “This is your bed. This is yours. This is a possession of yours,” you know?

The underlying tone is, “We’re here for the child.” You walk in and these kids are just so excited. They want to help build it. They want to run the drills. They want to bring in wood. Just giving a kid a sense of ownership, a sense of responsibility, as well as a good night’s sleep, is tremendous for them. They learn how to take care of things. They learn value. They get confidence – and they get a good night’s sleep.

Bionic woman helps others thrive after paralysis,"(CNN) —

Amanda Boxtel was 24 years old when she lay in a hospital bed, unable to move her legs.

A doctor came in to tell her she would never walk again – that her skiing accident had shattered four vertebrae and she was paralyzed from the waist down.

Meghan Dunn/CNN CNN Hero Amanda Boxtel

“I was an athlete. I was a dancer; an aerobics dancer with big hair in the ‘80s,” said Boxtel, now 50. “I felt invincible. And that all changed in a split second.”

Despite her injury, Boxtel didn’t stop living life. In the 26 years since, she’s had many adventures: skiing, mountain biking, parasailing, traveling the world.

“Destiny waits for no woman,” Boxtel often says. “There wasn’t the technology we have today. So, I had to figure out a lot for myself. I started my own fitness regimen and found my new life.”

In 2010, she learned about bionic exoskeleton suits – machines that help people with mobility issues walk. In an exoskeleton, Boxtel took her first step in 18 years.

She loved it so much, she raised funds to purchase her own. In a little more than a year, she took about 130,000 steps in the machine. Her health began to improve, her chronic pain started to decrease, and she felt stronger than ever.

“Human bodies are meant to stand and walk,” she said.

But Boxtel also felt guilty, realizing this technology was not easily accessible or affordable.

“I thought, ‘Amanda, why do you have to be the lucky girl? This is a fully adjustable device. We could get a whole community up and walking with this unit.’ “

In 2014, she started Bridging Bionics to do just that. The nonprofit provides high-tech physical therapy to people with mobility impairments near Aspen, Colorado.

The program is based in two local fitness facilities. The group’s physical therapists work one-on-one with clients, creating individualized plans based on their mobility issues – ranging from spinal cord injuries to neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and Parkinson’s disease.

“I wanted to … put it into a health club that promoted wellbeing, where someone could just walk in an exoskeleton doing physical therapy, but alongside someone else on a treadmill,” Boxtel said. “Disability can be socially isolating, and we are about bridging community, getting people out of their homes and engaging.”

The organization has provided its free or low-cost therapeutic sessions to more than 60 people, helping them overcome their injuries and do something doctors never believed possible: walk again.

CNN’s Meghan Dunn spoke with Boxtel about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What was it like the first time you stood up in an exoskeleton suit?

Amanda Boxtel: When I stood up, I looked at the world from a new perspective. It was as if all my dreams were burgeoning to life in one upright, powerful moment. It was psychological.

For the first time, I could look across the room at things high. I wasn’t looking up at nostrils or looking at navels. My world changed. It was not just this amazing physiological thing that happened to me. I could look at someone eye to eye, and I could have that delicious heart to heart hug.

CNN: Your organization uses two types of technology. What are they, and how do they help?

Boxtel: I incorporated whole body, side-alternating vibration and the bionic exoskeleton suit. I believe that the combination of these two technologies can reduce the risk of secondary complications associated with paralysis and neuromuscular impairments. The combination gives you a cardio workout, an increase in joint range of motion and circulation, especially in the paralyzed extremities. The main thing is a decrease in spasticity. Tone reduction or spasticity is so common, and these technologies combat that.

02:51 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: Learning to walk...again

The exoskeleton on its own takes it a step further. You can fully weight bear; it is fully supporting the individual, and that is critical for bone density. Your joints and bones are aligned as they were designed to be. It helps a person walk over ground, but not with stiff legs. It is a very natural gait, where I am bending my knee and I am striking the ground with my heel as you do when you walk. But I am walking over ground through space with the world going by me – so I am getting the visual cues to help rewire the brain and reconnect neuropathways. And there is evidence that just pure robotics assist and repetitive stepping over ground is rehabilitative.

CNN: You’re also helping people have access to this technology all the time, beyond the therapy sessions.

Boxtel: We help people with fundraising campaigns to acquire advanced technology to use at home – so they can access this every day. If you can have this at home every day, it will help with secondary complications and recovery. But it is daunting when you find out something costs $90,000. So, that’s where we come in and provide fundraising materials and fundraising ideas to help.

Everybody should have access to this technology. That’s my goal. How do we make this for humanity so that people don’t just sit at home? People need to start believing in themselves and their potential. Life isn’t over. They can still recover.

She speaks with a Southern accent and sounds like a much older woman, partly because of a massive stroke a dozen years ago. So it's jarring when she suddenly switches to the high-pitched, sing-songy voice of a little girl and speaks with shocking clarity about one night in October 2015.

A CNN Investigation Sick, dying and raped in America’s nursing homes The unthinkable is happening at facilities across the country: Vulnerable senior citizens are being raped and sexually abused by the very people paid to care for them. CNN quantifies the problem using data analysis and documents the systemic failure of nursing homes and state regulators to stop it.

She was living at a different place then -- the Brian Center, a 77-person nursing home on the outskirts of this mountain town.

""I had been attacked, attacked by a man sexually,"" she tells us, lying in her bed and fully dressed in high-heeled boots, with other clothing and shoes mixed in with her sheets. ""I was cornered between a closet and a bathroom, me with one arm. ... I couldn't breathe.""

Occasionally, as she recounts her story, she closes her eyes and looks as if she is falling asleep. Then she's suddenly alert again. She's proud of her reputation for being feisty and difficult -- she says she's always being told she complains too much. She recites -- correctly -- the phone number for the state hotline where nursing home residents can lodge their grievances.

It could be tempting to dismiss her story as drug-induced hallucinations or the confusion of a stroke survivor. Police might find her the very definition of an unreliable witness. But she is adamant she is telling the truth.

She says the man who aggressively cornered her that day, sticking his hand up her shirt and fondling her breasts, was a nursing aide named Luis Gomez.

""It sticks in my mind the same way every time,"" she says. ""After it's over is where the anger comes in. While it's happening, you want to cry. You think, why is this happening to me?""

This woman, pictured above and at the top of this story, is now in a nursing home where she feels safe. But she is still haunted by what she says happened to her at the Brian Center in Waynesville, North Carolina.

It took her about two weeks to summon the courage to report what happened. She uses the word violated.

""I was embarrassed. I thought, 'I need to tell someone,' but I was afraid no one would believe me.""

She was right. At first, no one did.

The woman told police that the director of nursing at the Brian Center Health & Rehabilitation, Gail Robertson, reacted to the story with disbelief. She told the resident ""to go live under a bridge, because nothing like that happened"" in her facility, the woman recalled.

The police showed up -- but not to investigate the allegation of sex abuse. Instead, an officer was asked to take the woman to a nearby hospital. There she was escorted to the sixth floor and locked in the psychiatric ward.

No one there believed her either.

""I am really telling the truth here, and it's really not fair you're turning a deaf ear to what I'm saying,"" she remembers telling hospital workers in the ward, where she had been a patient before.

Discharged after a few days, she had no choice but to return to the Brian Center. She left there as soon as she could, ending up homeless at one point before landing at her current residence.

She'd been dismissed as a complainer, a troublemaker, an attention seeker. But as it turned out, she wasn't the first nursing home resident to complain about Luis Gomez.

And she wouldn't be the last.

Meet Luis Gomez

Sometime around his 40th birthday, Luis Gomez started a new life in an unlikely place.

Waynesville is a town of less than 10,000, a mix of lifelong residents and so-called halfbacks, retirees from the North who tried living in Florida, then ended up here, less than an hour from trendy Asheville, in the Great Smoky Mountains.

It's also one of the whitest towns in the state.

The move was a big adjustment for Gomez, who'd come to the United States from Guatemala and spoke only Spanish.

""It was such a culture shock to him,"" said Rob Burns, a close friend and neighbor. His first American home had been in New Jersey, he told Burns. There, Gomez told him, ""my boss was Spanish, the place I worked was Spanish."" In Waynesville, he discovered, he would need to learn English ""in a hurry."" So he enrolled in classes at a local community college.

It was the late 1990s, and a construction job building racks for warehouses had brought Gomez to Waynesville. Soon he learned of another opportunity: a program at the community college that would help him become a certified nursing assistant, or CNA. That likely sounded promising, given the aging population in the area and the handful of nursing facilities that dot the country roads in Waynesville and surrounding Haywood County.

After earning his certification in 2000, Gomez first worked as an in-home caregiver. Then he was hired by a nursing home at the base of a tree-covered hill called Autumn Care of Waynesville. During the next 15 or so years, he would bounce between Autumn Care and at least four other nursing homes, including the Brian Center.

The Brian Center in Waynesville was the site of two alleged rapes and other reported sexual abuse.

Haywood County spans more than 500 square miles, but many of the facilities where Gomez worked are just a short drive from each other -- and not far from his home in the heart of Waynesville.

As with any nursing assistant, Gomez was tasked with the most intimate of duties: bathing residents, taking them to the bathroom and changing their diapers. It's unglamorous work that doesn't pay much, but he seemed to enjoy his job.

""He loved it. He loved helping people,"" his neighbor Burns told us, adding that Gomez often came over to his house for dinner and Bible study, and they talked about life and work.

A former co-worker said most nursing assistants rarely went the extra step for their patients. But Gomez did. He would alert a nurse that a resident needed a new bandage, for instance, and he took the time to get to know his patients and their families.

He was especially charming with female residents.

The phone call

A month after the stroke victim left the Brian Center, at 1:35 p.m. on Saturday, February 27, 2016, the Waynesville Police Department received a phone call from the facility. A nurse wanted to report a rape.

Sergeant Dee Parton was quickly dispatched to the nursing home just around the corner from the new police station downtown. The nurse, 35-year-old Krista Shalda, greeted Parton and told her a current female resident claimed a male nursing aide had assaulted her on Thursday night.

The resident had reported the incident the previous day to a different nurse, who said the facility's director of nursing, Gail Robertson, told her that she would ""handle everything.""

But police were not called. Nor was a doctor. No family members were notified.

And the aide was allowed to keep working.

When Shalda spoke to Robertson about the same accusation the next day, Robertson allegedly said again she would ""handle it"" and that ""they needed to keep everyone out of the issue."" But Shalda knew the aide had been accused of something similar before. She was not going to stand by and let Robertson keep it quiet. Even if it meant risking her job.

She told the sergeant about previous incidents, accusations made against this man by both a patient and a staff member.

Then she took Parton to the woman's room.

The 53-year-old resident was ""sitting on the side of her bed,"" according to Parton's report, ""with her oxygen on."" And she was crying.

The sergeant introduced herself and asked the woman if she was OK.

This will be difficult, Parton told her, but she needed to answer a few questions.

The accusation

Almost a year later, as part of an investigation into sexual abuse at nursing homes across the country, we asked the woman some of the same questions, over the phone. What she told us was remarkably similar to what she recounted to police that day. The woman said she suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure and needs full-time care. She moved into the Brian Center in 2015.

Luis Gomez took care of her.

""He bought me perfume and stuff,"" she told us. ""We were friends; we would joke around.""

He also told her he wanted to marry her. For weeks, she said, he would enter her room, make sure the curtain around her bed was closed and kiss her.

All of this made her uncomfortable, she said. But she kept quiet, worried that if she spoke up Gomez would get angry.

In her new facility, the woman who reported being abused at the Brian Center enjoys watching TV. She recalls being locked in the psychiatric ward of a hospital when she complained of sexual abuse at the Brian Center.

Then one night in February 2016, she said, Gomez did something she never expected -- and would never forget.

He came into her room after her roommate went out for a smoke and asked if she needed to go the bathroom. She said she did, and climbed out of bed. As she entered the bathroom and faced the toilet, she heard the door close and lock.

""He pulled my nightgown up and proceeded to rape me,"" she told us. ""I told him to stop, then I gave my excuse, 'My roommate is going to be coming in my room any moment,' and he stopped.""

She was in shock. A day passed before she told anyone.

When at first, nothing was done about her accusation, she feared Gomez might appear in her room again at any moment.

Robertson, the nursing director, would later tell state investigators in an interview that she suspended Gomez shortly after 8 p.m. the day the police were called so the facility could investigate. He was permitted to wait in the television room for a friend to pick him up. He stayed there for hours, until 11 p.m. In the interview, Robertson acknowledged she didn't remember telling him to clock out and didn't ensure he was supervised while he waited.

The woman still lives in the Brian Center today, in a different room. Only female nurses take care of her, she says. She vows she will never let a male employee touch her again. ""I totally lost trust in the men.""

She believes she did the right thing by going to police, and she is adamant that Gomez picked the wrong person to make his victim.

""I definitely have my wits about me.""

The trail of accusations

Less than 24 hours after taking this woman's statement, Parton, the sergeant, was back at the Brian Center in another woman's room.

The alleged victim had called 911 herself.

Parton, accompanied again by nurse Shalda, introduced herself to a 63-year-old woman sitting on the side of her bed. She too suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and needed help with intimate daily tasks.

Parton asked her what had happened, taking notes for the report she would file later.

""Luis started 'doing sexual stuff to me.' ""

One time, she said, she awoke to find his tongue shoved into her mouth. On another occasion, he ""rubbed me in my private area.""

He would touch her in bed and say, ""Let's go to the bathroom."" He would touch his groin and tell her, ""I want some.""

One day, as she got up from the toilet and tried to pull up her pants, she said, he pushed her into her wheelchair.

Parton's report details what the woman said happened next.

""Her hands went on to her wheelchair, and Luis 'rubbed up against me.' Luis put his penis between her legs and could not get it into her vagina. He then put his penis between her legs and ejaculated.""

Afterward, he handed her a washcloth and said, ""You need to wash that down.""

Gomez ensured her roommate was absent each time he assaulted her, she said. She was terrified to call for assistance when he was working on her wing. ""I would not ring my bell no matter what I needed.""

By the end of the interview, the woman was crying and said she was scared. Parton and Shalda tried to reassure her. She'd done the right thing, they told her. They would make sure she was safe.

They left her room and went back to the nursing station. There Parton asked Shalda: Had anyone else complained about this man?

Yes, Shalda told her. There was one more.

Haywood County's 500 square miles is largely rural. A handful of nursing homes dot the country roads.

Inside her room, a 64-year-old woman who had suffered a stroke lay in bed with a food tray resting on her chest. Just as she'd done before, Parton introduced herself and told the woman she wanted to ask a few questions.

The woman nodded, gesturing for the officer to begin.

""Do you know Luis?""

""Yes,"" the woman said loudly.

""Has Luis done anything inappropriate to you?""

""Yes.""

Parton continued: How had he been inappropriate?

He had given her a bath, she said.

""What did he do to you in the bath?""

""Very sexual,"" she said, looking Parton directly in the eyes.

Parton asked the woman to explain what she meant, and she said that he had ""felt my boobs. He wanted to clean me up.""

Had Gomez touched her anywhere else?

The woman moved her right hand and placed it on her groin.

""Did Luis touch you there?""

""I reported him (to) Gail; Gail didn't believe me, said I repeat myself. ... When he changes my diaper I don't trust him. He's not right. I don't like to talk about it. Told Gail and nothing happened, she didn't believe me. He touched down there too much.""

Parton patted the resident on the arm and told her she believed her.

""Thank you, sergeant,"" she said.

Then she spoke again.

""I didn't like to see him. When I heard his voice in (the) hall I got scared and nervous.""

She'd reported the abuse to Robertson, she repeated. Nothing had come of it.

The flashback

Waynesville police train to be prepared for anything.

A man unloaded round after round from a high-powered rifle into the local Verizon Wireless store in 2014. He reportedly believed a cable outage was evidence of a government conspiracy.

And in Operation Dry Erase, a massive drug bust targeting everything from prescription narcotics to crack cocaine, local news outlets detailed how Waynesville police helped nab 31 suspects ranging in age from 17 to 64.

But most incidents investigated in the town don't go beyond property crimes such as burglary or minor fraud. So many reports of rape and sexual abuse from a local nursing home were a horrific first for this small-town police department.

Just hours after the sergeant returned from the Brian Center, investigators huddled together in the police station to discuss the case.

Investigating sex abuse allegations at a local nursing home became a top priority for Waynesville police detectives Chris Chandler and Paige Shell.

They now had accusations from three women, ages 53, 63 and 64 -- all relatively young to find themselves in a nursing home. Each had health problems that affected mobility -- and could make it hard to escape an aggressor. Each claimed to be a victim of the same aide: Luis Gomez.

Suddenly a young officer, Derek Embler, chimed in.

Sign up to receive updates on this and other CNN investigations

He remembered driving over to the Brian Center four months earlier, in October 2015. He had been called to pick up a woman and take her to a local hospital, where she was being committed to the psychiatric ward.

""She was happy to get out of there,"" he recalled her saying, ""because she was being raped by an employee.""

The pattern

With four alleged victims at the Brian Center, police expanded their investigation to anywhere Gomez had worked. Parton brought an ambitious young detective onto the case.

Paige Shell had spent most of her life in Waynesville and nearly a decade on the police force. This would become one of the most disturbing cases of her career.

One of the first things Shell did was visit the hospital where the woman who said Gomez wooed her with perfume was taken for a sexual assault examination. Then she hunkered down with her boss, Lieutenant Chris Chandler, whom she'd known since childhood, to trace Gomez's trail. Soon, they'd identified a number of potential victims.

From the Haywood County sheriff, they learned that officers had been called to investigate Gomez as early as 2011. This was at Smoky Mountain Health and Rehabilitation Center, a friendlier-looking brick facility about 10 minutes from the Brian Center.

And from the state, which oversees nursing homes, the detectives learned Gomez had been the subject of sexual abuse claims reported at several different facilities.

While police and the state wouldn't comment on those claims, citing an active investigation, police records show a state investigator helped police locate the woman who had been transported to the psychiatric ward from the Brian Center. It's likely the state also knew about the 2011 Smoky Mountain complaint because the sheriff's office was involved.

The allegation there came from an 89-year-old resident who suffered from dementia, according to someone who worked with him at the time. The woman accused Gomez of putting his fingers inside her vagina, according to the former co-worker, who said Gomez was suspended for a few days while the facility and law enforcement investigated.

Another source told us a woman at yet another facility accused Gomez of touching her inappropriately, but he was cleared after the woman and her husband recanted, saying she had been confused. The director there told us the facility had done everything it was supposed to do, including promptly reporting the incident to the state.

So it appeared there were at least six potential victims from three different facilities. And that the state was aware of at least three.

Shell and Chandler were confused. If Gomez had been accused so many times before, how was he still working as a nursing aide?

They asked to see his official record on file with the state. To their surprise, it was perfectly clean.

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services would not comment on Gomez specifically but told us that all allegations against nursing aides are ""investigated, as warranted"" and recorded in a state database where potential employers could learn of pending allegations or substantiated findings.

""Unlike law enforcement investigations and criminal cases in which it must be determined that a person committed the alleged offense 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' we must simply find that it is 'more likely than not' that a person committed the act,"" a representative said in an email.

But all of the complaints against Gomez had been deemed ""unsubstantiated,"" meaning nursing home and state officials ruled they couldn't be proven. And because the state only flags substantiated complaints about an employee -- a policy that's consistent across the country -- any facility looking to hire Gomez would have seen a record showing a longtime nursing aide with no history of problems.

""If an attorney gets in trouble, they are reported to their bar (association),"" Chandler said, but ""if a CNA gets in trouble, crickets.""

The officer considered the evidence needed for the state to substantiate a complaint to be ""astronomical."" ""It's virtually impossible to substantiate a complaint,"" he said.

A bail bonds building stands near the new Haywood County Detention Center in Waynesville.

During our investigation into nursing homes across the country, we found Gomez's case was far from an anomaly. We uncovered numerous examples of caregivers continuing to work with the elderly despite repeated complaints against them and other red flags.

In a similar case in Minnesota, nursing aide George Kpingbah worked at a facility for nearly eight years despite multiple police and state investigations into sexual assault claims against him. None were substantiated. But when a nurse witnessed him raping an 83-year-old with Alzheimer's, he was charged and convicted. He is currently serving eight years behind bars.

In Florida, Joel Maldonado earned his certification as a nursing aide despite a troubled childhood marked by allegations that he sexually assaulted another child and arrests for domestic violence, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, according to allegations in court documents and public records. None of this stopped him from being hired at an assisted living facility in Port Orange. And within a matter of months of going to work at that facility, Maldonado allegedly sexually assaulted three residents, including a 100-year-old woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He confessed to his minister and law enforcement. But police reports show that the victims didn't remember the alleged abuse and the prosecutor dropped all charges against him. Calls to Maldonado were not returned.

And in a review of thousands of nursing home inspection reports, we found repeated examples of facilities allowing problematic employees to stay on the job. In one case, for example, a facility administrator in Texas allowed a nurse to continue working despite allegations he raped one resident three times and sexually abused two others. The nurse was ultimately arrested and charged with rape, but the charges were dismissed when prosecutors were unable to secure the alleged victim's testimony for trial.

What should we investigate next? Email us.

While each of these cases is disturbing, the investigation of Gomez stood out because of the sheer number of allegations against him.

The Waynesville detectives recognized the difficulty in proving sexual assault -- especially when victims are sick or elderly and have unreliable memories. But they wondered why nursing homes and state officials weren't at least keeping a vigilant eye for alarming patterns of complaints.

Shouldn't a potential employer be able to see a track record of complaints against a single caregiver -- whether substantiated or not? And shouldn't repeated complaints at a single facility be a cause for serious concern among nursing home administrators?

Under the current system, an aide can rack up any number of complaints and continue working as long as the claims haven't been substantiated.

So there was nothing stopping Gomez from being hired by the Brian Center in July 2015. Despite allegations made by residents at other facilities where he worked, his record was spotless.

The Brian Center is only a seven-minute drive from the home listed as Gomez's in court filings. He typically arrived at work at 3 p.m. As his shift went on, the halls emptied out. Supervisors and other workers left for the day and visitors were no longer welcome. With a skeleton staff left, residents climbed into their beds for the night.

They were all but alone with Gomez.

Wives and girlfriends

Luis Gomez is known for being a ladies' man.

He's been married at least three times, and has a reputation for dating other women on the side. His current wife says she discovered his cell phone contained the contact information and headshots of a roster of women, many of them co-workers. Even one of his alleged victims had heard stories about his romantic relationships. And people who worked with him over the years say his flirting sometimes crossed the line and he got in trouble for harassing female co-workers.

He married a woman in Guatemala in 1986; their divorce records indicate she traveled to the United States with him, but they separated in 1991. When he officially divorced her in North Carolina eight years later, Gomez stated he couldn't find her.

That same year, he married another woman. They lived together in a modest, two-story blue house on a dead-end street not far from the center of town, where homes have recently sold for about $100,000 and a Habitat for Humanity build is underway.

After being ill for years, she passed away in 2010. He quickly began dating another woman, a fellow nursing aide named Linda Gomez.

Nursing aide Luis Gomez most recently lived in this house, according to property records.

She told us that their relationship started out like any love story, with Gomez buying her fancy dinners and taking her on vacations. He called her his ""blond blue-eyed baby"" and helped her get a job at the nursing home where he worked, Smoky Mountain.

But her adult children and teenage granddaughter didn't like how possessive he seemed. They begged her not to marry him. She did anyway, in 2011.

Soon, she says, she discovered he was already cheating on her with at least one woman. She says he started to get physically abusive.

But she still loved him. She was determined to make their marriage work and continued working alongside him at the Smoky Mountain nursing home. When she heard that a resident, a woman in her late 80s, had accused Gomez of violating her, she didn't believe it.

The dark side

So Luis Gomez is a ladies' man, but could he also be a rapist?

""He's a real Jekyll and Hyde,"" says Linda Gomez, who is in her 60s now and still married to him. She reluctantly agreed to meet at a pizza joint on the outskirts of Waynesville.

They are separated now, and she was living in Alabama when she first heard about the Brian Center accusations against Gomez. She didn't want to believe they could be true. But part of her thought they must be.

Her granddaughter, Makayla Thomas, urged her to talk to us. Her hands shook as she detailed the emotional and physical abuse she said she suffered at Gomez's hands. Looking back, she feels ashamed she wasn't strong enough to leave him earlier than she did. She stayed short of a year but says it felt so much longer.

The final straw came in May 2012.

""He grabbed me by my throat and said, 'You don't know how many ways I could kill you,' "" she told us.

When her son called from Alabama, he could tell something wasn't right. He phoned the police.

She says Gomez was arrested and taken to jail, and that he was ultimately ordered to take anger management classes. She also obtained a temporary restraining order to make him keep his distance.

Her description of the incident matches what records show she told the court.

""He grabbed me around the throat and said I could kill you,"" she stated at the time. ""Luis started telling me I couldn't be with my children and be his wife. He grabbed me by the hair of my head and jerked my head back. He was pushing me down on the couch by my shoulder and had my hair.""

She told police that Gomez had ""at least 3-4"" guns in their home. Documents also show she chose not to pursue a permanent restraining order so the case was dismissed. She now believes the disturbing claims about her husband -- that he raped and abused nursing home residents.

""My personal opinion is he's not good to be out in society. If he's going to do it to an older person ... he's going to do it to anyone.""

The aftermath

Gomez was fired from the Brian Center a little more than two weeks after the claims against him emerged in 2016.

The nursing home was also in the crosshairs. State investigators descended on the Brian Center to determine whether the facility was also to blame.

Why hadn't the police been called sooner? Why wasn't Gomez removed from the facility immediately? Why weren't all these claims of abuse taken more seriously?

Luis Gomez is expected to stand trial on two counts of rape at the Haywood County Courthouse later this year.



State investigators, working in conjunction with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, ultimately cited the Brian Center for a litany of problems: failure to protect residents from sexual abuse, failure to inform the alleged victims' families and physicians, failure to report suspicion of a crime immediately to law enforcement, failure to supervise the alleged perpetrator until he left the facility, failure to assess the residents immediately for injuries, failure to notify the state promptly of allegations, failure to empower staff to call law enforcement.

As a result, the facility temporarily lost government reimbursements for new residents. And unless it proved it had taken steps to prevent such failures in the future, it risked losing this funding permanently. It was also forced to pay a fine of $110,402.50.

Robertson, the nursing director who allegedly ignored residents' reports of abuse, was fired. Her boss, the administrator of the Brian Center, also left the facility. Neither faced criminal charges and neither responded to our emails or phone calls. Efforts to reach them by knocking on the doors of their homes (as listed in public records) were unsuccessful.

The facility's parent company, SavaSeniorCare, said it couldn't comment on Gomez, except to say that once it became aware of the allegations against him it took immediate action. ""We took steps to keep all of our residents safe from that point forward,"" a spokeswoman said by email, adding that the facility was found to have addressed the concerns raised by state investigators.

As for Gomez, he waited weeks in unemployed limbo as police built a case against him. In late March, just over a month after the investigation began, he was arrested at a girlfriend's residence and taken to the local jail.

A grand jury indicted Gomez on two counts of forcible rape and sexual activity by a custodian. These charges stem from the accusations of two alleged victims, the woman who triggered the investigation by reporting that Gomez raped her in the bathroom and the woman who called 911 after months of alleged abuse.

Gomez, who insists on his innocence, is expected to stand trial later this year.

In the meantime, folks around town are trying to figure out what they missed in this seemingly affable guy. Or whether Gomez is being railroaded.

""He was a very nice guy and very likable. ... That is why it is so hard to get people to buy into that he did this, because he did seem so genuine,"" a former co-worker told us. But ""a lot of times predators are very liked, and they are close to their victims.""

Others are firm in their belief that Gomez did nothing wrong, that these women must simply be confused or seeking attention -- or a payout.

Burns, the neighbor who studied the Bible with Gomez, says he never heard a single harsh word against him until the day he was arrested.

""I just can't -- and never will -- believe that Luis would do something like that. ... He just liked people, and he got himself into a bad situation.""

Worried that Gomez is without support or information about when he will finally get his day in court, Burns visits him regularly in jail.

Gomez, he says, has tried to stay positive and refuses to speak ill of others. He considers what has happened to him a wake-up call to get back in touch with God.

""I just can't believe he has that kind of attitude,"" Burns says. ""I would be furious. Especially if I was innocent.""

Allison Richmond, a reporter for the local newspaper, The Mountaineer, says stories about the Gomez case have sparked readers' interest. They can't believe this is happening in their little town. Or they express a different concern:

Were their loved ones victimized?

At the Brian Center, a large beat-up sign hangs outside: NOW HIRING CNAs.

The jail where Gomez is incarcerated is part of the Haywood County Law Enforcement Center.

The jail visit

We weren't the first women to visit Gomez in jail.

His wife saw him last year; she says she asked him how he could have done this. She learned then that other women had been visiting him, including a girlfriend and a woman who apparently claimed to be his wife. Some, she said, used the jail ATM to transfer money into his inmate account.

Luis Gomez says he is innocent.

We spoke with him over a video-conferencing system. We had two key questions: Did you do what you are accused of? And if not, why would so many women make up such graphic claims about you?

Through the video screen, we could see inmates mulling around, some reading books, others with cheap blankets wrapped around their shoulders. Gomez looked at us for a few seconds before sitting so low in a chair that we could only see his forehead. But we briefly caught a glimpse of a disheveled man with what looked like the remnants of a swollen black eye.

The first thing he told us is that he is guilty of nothing. That all the charges stem from a big misunderstanding.

I don't know if you have any idea what is my kind of job, the 58-year-old said in broken English. Do you have any idea?

He meant the intimate duties he performed: dressing, bathing and cleaning up residents. Helping them go to the bathroom. Changing their diapers. He seemed to be saying someone could easily mistake a touch for something sexual.

We talked to him for the 30 minutes allotted to visitors. At the very end, he said it again.

He did nothing.

He regrets nothing.

Everything was investigated by the state, he said.

But every time they can't find any proof that I did anything inappropriate.",
"Sick, dying and raped in America's nursing homes","Some of the victims can't speak. They rely on walkers and wheelchairs to leave their beds. They have been robbed of their memories. They come to nursing homes to be cared for.

Instead, they are sexually assaulted.

A CNN Investigation Six women. Three nursing homes. And the man accused of rape and abuse Luis Gomez appeared to many to be the perfect nursing aide. He loved his job and went the distance for residents in his care. But now a different image has emerged: Gomez, who insists he is innocent, is accused of being a serial abuser -- moving from facility to facility despite a history of allegations against him. CNN documents his trail. Opinion My mother was raped at 88 A daughter describes the resilience that helped her family not only heal but fight for reform.

The unthinkable is happening at facilities throughout the country: Vulnerable seniors are being raped and sexually abused by the very people paid to care for them.

It's impossible to know just how many victims are out there. But through an exclusive analysis of state and federal data and interviews with experts, regulators and the families of victims, CNN has found that this little-discussed issue is more widespread than anyone would imagine.

Even more disturbing: In many cases, nursing homes and the government officials who oversee them are doing little -- or nothing -- to stop it.

Sometimes pure -- and even willful -- negligence is at work. In other instances, nursing home employees and administrators are hamstrung in their efforts to protect victims who can't remember exactly what happened to them or even identify their perpetrators.

In cases reviewed by CNN, victims and their families were failed at every stage. Nursing homes were slow to investigate and report allegations because of a reluctance to believe the accusations -- or a desire to hide them. Police viewed the claims as unlikely at the outset, dismissing potential victims because of failing memories or jumbled allegations. And because of the high bar set for substantiating abuse, state regulators failed to flag patterns of repeated allegations against a single caregiver.

It's these systemic failures that make it especially hard for victims to get justice -- and even easier for perpetrators to get away with their crimes.

""At 83 years old, unable to speak, unable to fight back, she was even more vulnerable than she was as a little girl fleeing her homeland. In fact, she was as vulnerable as an infant when she was raped. The dignity which she always displayed during her life, which was already being assaulted so unrelentingly by Alzheimer's disease, was dealt a final devastating blow by this man. The horrific irony is not lost upon me ... that the very thing she feared most as a young girl fleeing her homeland happened to her in the final, most vulnerable days of her life.""

Choking back tears, Fischer detailed her mother's story -- recounting how she had fled Indonesia as a youth with her family to escape the rape and killing of young girls by Japanese soldiers, only to fall victim decades later to a man whose job was to care for her.

A fellow caregiver saw male nursing assistant George Kpingbah in 83-year-old Sonja Fischer's room at 4:30 a.m. on December 18, 2014, at the Walker Methodist Health Center in Minneapolis. A bare leg was on each side of his hips, and her adult diaper lay open on the bed. When the witness noticed the 76-year-old aide thrusting back and forth, she said she knew a sexual assault was occurring.

Kpingbah ultimately pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal sexual conduct with a mentally impaired or helpless victim and was sentenced to eight years in prison. In an emotional statement directed at Kpingbah during sentencing, the judge told him he had done more than ravage the lives of his victim and her family. He had betrayed the public trust granted to caregivers who have such intimate access to the sick and elderly.

""You violated (a) position of authority, a position of trust,"" Judge Elizabeth Cutter said at the sentencing hearing. ""The ramifications of what you did are so far-reaching. ... It also affected everyone in that facility. Everyone who stays in that facility. Everyone who works at that facility. It affects everyone who has to place a loved one in a facility.""

Kpingbah apologized at the hearing and said he planned to take his Bible with him to prison. His attorney asked for leniency. Kpingbah had endured his own personal struggles as a refugee, the attorney said, fleeing Liberia after many of his family members were killed. Kpingbah's one ""unspeakable act,"" he told the judge, was completely out of character.

Yet in court documents uncovered by CNN, prosecutors revealed it wasn't the first time Kpingbah had been investigated over sexual assault allegations. Personnel records obtained by prosecutors during the investigation and reviewed by CNN show Kpingbah was suspended three times as Walker Methodist officials investigated repeated accusations of sexual abuse at the facility, including at least two where he was the main suspect.

The earliest complaint was in 2008, when police investigated allegations he had engaged in sexual intercourse with a 65-year-old who suffered from multiple sclerosis. In another case, an 83-year-old blind and deaf woman who lived on the same wing as Fischer's mother said she was raped multiple times -- always at midnight. Police investigated her report just seven months before Fischer's mother was assaulted. While the woman could not identify her assailant, Kpingbah was suspended by the facility along with several other male staffers who were on duty during the nights of the alleged assaults.

Predators find elderly patients to be easy prey.

None of these allegations were found to be substantiated by the facility or the state. For years, Walker Methodist kept Kpingbah working on the overnight shift. Until that early morning in December 2014, when someone caught him in the act.

In that instance, the Minnesota Department of Health found that the facility acted immediately to ensure the resident's safety and promptly removed Kpingbah. The state also noted that the facility had previously provided Kpingbah with required abuse training. As a result, the facility was not cited for any wrongdoing; only Kpingbah was held accountable for the assault.

Maya Fischer had no way of knowing about the previous allegations against Kpingbah uncovered by CNN. But she sued Kpingbah, who agreed to an unusual arrangement in which he is on the hook for a massive $15 million judgment only if he abuses again.

Walker Methodist refused to comment on the previous allegations against Kpingbah, who worked at the facility for nearly eight years, but said in a statement that it fully cooperated with authorities and that ""the care and well-being of all of our residents and patients is our primary focus.""

CNN reached out to family members of other residents who earlier reported they were sexually assaulted at Walker Methodist during the time Kpingbah worked there (though he was not deemed a suspect in every case). They said the officials there were quick to dismiss the residents' claims as hallucinations or fantasies.

""Walker Methodist certainly failed to handle this appropriately with my mother and other residents, and there should be consequences,"" said the son of the first alleged victim after learning of Kpingbah's rape conviction from CNN.

A son of a different alleged victim, who had accused an unknown perpetrator, said he was irate he was never told that a pattern of complaints had emerged against a single caregiver. Had he known of this pattern, the son said, he would have taken his mother's report of abuse more seriously. Instead, he trusted Walker Methodist.

The Minnesota Department of Health told CNN it is barred by state law from releasing the identity of anyone investigated over an allegation that has not been substantiated, regardless of the number of allegations.

But both family members of these two alleged sexual assault victims also questioned the state health department. How effective is its oversight if it was aware of the multiple reports of abuse at Walker Methodist and still could not intervene?

When pressed by CNN, the agency said that the reports occurred during a time when a paper system was used and that it has been working to modernize this system in the hopes of ""flagging such patterns.""

A daughter's heartbreaking story

Abuse after abuse

Some accounts of alleged sexual abuse come from civil and criminal court documents filed against nursing homes, assisted living facilities and individuals who work there. Other incidents are buried in detailed reports filed by state health investigators.

A 76-pound North Carolina nursing home resident who was so cognitively impaired she required assistance with even the simplest daily tasks reported that a nursing aide, behind closed doors, pushed her head toward him and forced her to give him oral sex.

The third time a resident of a Texas nursing home was raped by a nurse, the assailant ejaculated in the victim's mouth and on her breasts. When he left, desperate to hold on to whatever evidence she could, she spit the semen from her mouth into her bra and kept the unwashed bra for three weeks. ""That's all I have,"" she later told state investigators.

In Iowa, a woman who depended on a walker to move around and couldn't bathe herself reported that a nursing aide sexually assaulted her in the shower. But the facility never flagged this accusation to authorities because the aide had left the country.

Inside a prosecutor's case file It’s rare to get a glimpse inside the mind of a criminal investigator. But when CNN obtained the entire case file for a nursing aide convicted of raping an elderly stroke victim, we were able to do just that. Nancy Dunlap was tasked with this case by the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office in Minneapolis. As she began digging into the rape charge against nursing aide George Kpingbah, she uncovered a history of sexual assault allegations against him, and a name change that complicated her investigation. She requested all reports of sexual abuse from the facility where Kpingbah worked, Walker Methodist Health Center. He was not linked to all of them by the facility but she wanted to see a complete picture of allegations made while he worked there. Walker Methodist said in a statement to CNN that it fully cooperated with authorities, and that “the care and well-being of all of our residents and patients is our primary focus.” Because Kpingbah eventually took a plea deal related to a rape that was witnessed, much of this information never made it out of Dunlap’s file.

An 88-year-old California woman who'd only had sex with one man her entire life -- her husband of nearly 70 years -- said she awoke in her nursing home bed with her catheter removed and her bed wet. The next thing she remembered was seeing an unknown male nursing assistant staring at her naked body. ""This is why I love my job,"" she remembered him saying, according to what she told police. Weeks later, the woman complained of severe vaginal pain and ""oozing blisters,"" and she was eventually diagnosed with incurable genital herpes. To this day, the identity of the alleged perpetrator hasn't been determined.

And finally, in a small town in North Carolina, a nursing assistant continued working for years despite multiple reports of alleged abuse. Only after a defiant nurse reported the abuse to police was he fired and arrested. Luis Gomez, 58, is in jail awaiting trial and maintains his innocence.

Most of the cases examined by CNN involved lone actors. But in some cases, a mob mentality fueled the abuse. And it's not just women who have been victimized.

CNN found more than 1,000 nursing homes have been cited for mishandling suspected cases of sex abuse.

For months, a group of male nursing aides at a California facility abused and humiliated five male residents -- taking videos and photos to share with other staff members. One victim, a 56-year-old with cerebral palsy, was paraded around naked. Another, an elderly man with paralysis who struggled to speak was pinched on his nipples and penis and forced to eat feces out of his adult diapers. He was terrified his abusers would kill him. While the aides lost their certifications, an investigation by Disability Rights California found that many of them never faced charges.

Another group of nursing aides, teenagers in Albert Lea, Minnesota, tormented at least 15 male and female residents, many of whom suffered from Alzheimer's. The female aides struck, poked and rubbed the residents and touched their breasts. They inserted their fingers into one resident's rectum. They rubbed the residents' crotches and laughed. One aide pulled down her own pants and sat on a female resident's lap -- humping and groping her. ""I was basically appalled by the callous disregard for human decency,"" a judge later said. Two of the abusers, who were 18 at the time and convicted of disorderly conduct by a caregiver, served 42 days in jail. The other teens were tried in juvenile court and faced no jail time at all.

An untracked issue

Despite the litany of abuses detailed in government reports, there is no comprehensive, national data on how many cases of sexual abuse have been reported in facilities housing the elderly.

State health investigators examine all types of abuse reported at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, whether reported by the facilities or flagged by complaints to the state from witnesses, family members or victims. In the case of nursing homes, state officials typically conduct these investigations, as well as routine inspections, on behalf of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which regulates the more than 15,000 facilities that receive government reimbursements that pay for many residents' care. Both state health agencies and the federal government then use the information to rate facilities and issue financial penalties for the worst offenders.

How safe are your elderly loved ones? There’s no way to know about abuse that goes unreported. But you can look up the name of a nursing home in federal inspection data and see whether it has been cited for sexual abuse or other issues in the past three years. Here's how: Go to the federal Nursing Home Compare website to look up facilities by name or location. On the first page of results, you will see a star rating for the facility based on factors such as staffing levels. A history of abuse or other inspection problems will typically be reflected in the ""health inspection"" rating. Click on the health inspection rating to see a summary of the facility's most recent inspection. From here, click on ""View all health inspections."" For details, go to a specific date and click ""View full report."" From the main profile page for the facility, click on ""Penalties"" to see if an inspection resulted in fines or payment denials. To view older citations, download archived reports here or file a public records request here. Some states may also offer detailed information. A list of state websites is here.

CNN surveyed the health departments and other agencies that oversee long-term care facilities in all 50 states. Of the states that could provide at least some data, the responses varied widely.

Illinois, for example, said 386 allegations of sexual abuse of nursing home residents had been recorded since 2013, 201 of which involved a caretaker. Hawaii said eight allegations of sexual abuse were investigated between 2011 and 2015 -- five of which involved a caregiver. And when states provided a further breakdown of how many allegations had been substantiated, the results demonstrate just how few accusations end up being proven -- whether it's because of the extreme hurdles posed by aging victims, the destruction of evidence or half-hearted investigations by facilities and regulators.

Of the 386 cases in Illinois, 59 were considered substantiated. And in Texas, 11 of 251 sexual complaints in the 2015 fiscal year were substantiated. Wisconsin said it didn't have a single substantiated report of abuse in the last five years.

But most states could not say how frequently abuse investigations involved sexual allegations, often stating that sex abuse allegations are not categorized separately from other forms of abuse.

The federal government doesn't specifically track all sexual allegations either.

More than 16,000 complaints of sexual abuse have been reported since 2000 in long-term care facilities (which include both nursing homes and assisted living facilities), according to federal data housed by the Administration for Community Living. But agency officials warned that this figure doesn't capture everything -- only those cases in which state long-term care ombudsmen (who act as advocates for facility residents) were somehow involved in resolving the complaints.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services lumps sexual allegations into a category that includes all kinds of abuse, such as physical or financial. The agency said this is because it takes all forms of abuse seriously. When asked by CNN, the agency conducted a specialized search using sex-related keywords. But because not every case was sexual in nature, CNN had to review each case individually to filter out any irrelevant citations.

The reports show that 226 nursing homes have been cited for failing to protect residents from instances in which sexual abuse was substantiated between 2010 and 2015. Of these cases, around 60% resulted in fines, which totaled more than $9 million -- though only 16 facilities were permanently cut off from Medicare and Medicaid funding. (Because the federal government only regulates nursing homes, this analysis did not include assisted living facilities.)

But these statistics only tell a small part of the story because they fail to capture the many instances in which nursing homes have been cited for mishandling allegations of sexual abuse in other ways -- ranging from botched investigations to cover-ups.

Using inspection reports filed between 2013 and 2016 and a similar sex-related keyword search, CNN conducted its own detailed analysis.

The result: CNN exclusively found that the federal government has cited more than 1,000 nursing homes for mishandling or failing to prevent alleged cases of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse at their facilities during this period. (This includes some of the cases provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.) And nearly 100 of these facilities have been cited multiple times during the same period.

Complaints and allegations that don't result in a citation, which the government calls a ""deficiency,"" aren't included in these Medicare reports. In addition, national studies have found that a large percentage of rape victims typically never report their assaults. So these numbers likely represent only a fraction of the alleged sexual abuse incidents in nursing homes nationwide.

Our analysis CNN began its in-depth analysis by obtaining federal inspection reports filed between 2013 and 2016. These reports are filed by state health inspectors working in conjunction with the federal government for the more than 15,000 nursing homes that receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. They include complaints and allegations where state inspectors have cited a facility for failing to meet a wide variety of federal standards, whether it is storing food improperly or serious allegations of abuse or neglect. For CNN's analysis, these reports were narrowed down using a specific set of sex-related keywords. But because many citations included information about intimate medical care and not abuse, CNN reporters read more than 6,000 citations to identify only those related to allegations of sexual assault or abuse. During this analysis, the reporters also categorized allegations based on the severity of abuse and the kind of perpetrator (whether a caregiver, resident or visitor), among other data points. At the end of this weeks-long analysis, CNN concluded that more than 1,000 nursing homes across the country have been cited for somehow mishandling or failing to prevent alleged cases of sexual assault at their facilities in recent years.

Of the instances examined, at least a quarter were allegedly perpetrated by aides, nurses and other staff members, while a small portion involved facility visitors (including family members) or unknown assailants. And while most citations dealt with cases of residents abusing other residents, accusations made about caregivers and other workers tended to be far more serious, involving allegations of forced intercourse, oral sex, digital penetration and other forms of sexual assault.

Follow the trail of rape allegations against a nursing assistant in the second part of our series.

The stories found in these reports range from sad to sickening.

An aide admitted to urinating in the shower while a female resident was inside it, showing her his erect penis and kissing her -- then warning her not to tell anyone. A nurse overheard two aides talking about how a resident had been given a lap dance that made him ejaculate. A woman was found gagging and trying to fight off a male resident who had his penis in her mouth. Family members viewed video footage of an aide repeatedly raping their loved one, who was on feeding tubes, after hiding a camera in a stuffed animal in the room.

CNN's analysis found that the nursing homes themselves are a large part of the problem. More than 500 facilities had been cited for failing to investigate and report allegations of sexual abuse thoroughly to authorities or for not properly screening employees for potentially abusive pasts. One nursing director told a state inspector that ""if the facility reported all allegations it would be numerous and the State Agency wouldn't want that either.""

Because of this lack of investigation or reporting, it's hard to determine how many of the alleged cases of abuse were substantiated or resulted in criminal proceedings. But at least several hundred were confessed to by the perpetrators or observed by witnesses.

Amid the reports of sexual abuse were hundreds of stories that painted scenes of chaos:

Residents climbing into other residents' beds and eating their food. Running wildly up and down halls. Pulling out knives and other weapons. Hallucinating about snakes coming out of heads and little boys hiding in the curtains. Urinating in wastebaskets. Drinking and doing drugs. Falling asleep in the bathtub. Stealing walkers. Choking and hitting people with fists and wheelchair parts. Escaping out windows. Drinking lotion and oven cleaner.

Such a challenging environment provides some context for how serious allegations of sexual assault could be overlooked.

An unchecked 'epidemic'

It's rarely talked about, but sexual assault in the very facilities tasked with caring for the elderly is hardly a new problem, with cases dating back decades.

It's happening all over the country. In cities, the suburbs and the countryside. In nursing homes housing low-income residents on Medicaid. And in centers where people pay thousands of dollars out of their own savings to be there. They're owned by huge corporations and regional chains but also by nonprofits and mom-and-pop small business owners.

And the issue is only becoming more pressing as the elderly population booms, with the number of Americans over age 65 projected to more than double between 2010 and 2050.

Yet the facilities that currently house more than 1 million senior citizens typically pay low wages to nursing assistants (about $11 or $12 an hour), making it difficult to attract and keep quality workers. And during the most vulnerable hours, the night shift, there are often few supervisors.

The abuse is ""an epidemic,"" said Mark Kosieradzki, a Minnesota attorney who has represented a number of victims and their families, including Fischer, the woman who recounted her mother's rape in court. ""Predators find elderly patients to be easy prey. Those patients often have dementia. They can't say what happened, or are not believed because many people find it inconceivable that a 28-year-old caregiver would want to rape someone's grandmother.""

Kosieradzki and other experts who advocate on behalf of the elderly say strong federal and state laws are in place that require abuses to be reported and investigated. The problem, they say, is that these laws are not always followed by the nursing homes. And while federal and state officials told CNN that regulators aggressively investigate complaints and hold facilities accountable, critics say their enforcement isn't tough enough. And investigations by facility and state officials are often cursory at best, rarely going deep enough to meet a difficult burden of proof.

We weren't prepared for anything of this nature.

Many nursing home employees promptly report abusers to authorities as required by federal law and assist in the investigations. But in numerous examples of abuse uncovered by CNN, the facilities themselves have made it possible for violent rapes and sexual assaults to go unchecked.

In these facilities, allegations are routinely questioned or dismissed because victims have cognitive conditions such as Alzheimer's. Workers often lack the specific training needed to spot sexual abuse -- keeping reports of abuse from ever reaching authorities. And the reputation and safety of the facility may take priority: There's often a fear that bringing investigators into a cash-strapped facility may expose other issues, threaten a nursing home with closure or open the door to costly lawsuits.

Most sinister of all are administrators and employees who actively impede investigations.

""There are some situations where they don't realize it's happened, and they don't want to believe it. They just don't understand it,"" said Ann Burgess, a well-known nurse and Boston College nursing professor who specializes in the assessment and treatment of elderly sexual abuse victims. ""There are other cases where they try to cover it up. ... They blame the victim.""

At one Colorado facility, nursing aide Antonio Nieto had already been accused of raping one female resident in her bed at Broomfield Skilled Nursing & Rehabilitation Center when an allegation emerged from another woman. Prosecutors say the facility allowed Nieto to return to work after the first alleged assault because the facility had found the woman's claims to be ""unfounded."" The facility, which has come under new management since the assaults, said it allowed Nieto to return to work only after being told the police investigation had stalled and no criminal charges were expected.

He was fired after the other victim came forward. Nieto was ultimately sentenced to 24 years to life in prison. Broomfield paid a $51,837 fine, a paltry sum in comparison with the millions it received in annual government reimbursements for patient care.

Nursing assistants Andrew Merzwski, from left, Antonio Nieto and George Kpingbah were all convicted of raping elderly residents.

When the chef at an assisted living facility, was arrested in Louisiana last year in the alleged rape of a 78-year-old resident, a director at the facility, Julie Henry, was quick to issue an emotional statement to local media -- claiming the company was ""shocked and disheartened."" But not long after, Henry was arrested, accused of orchestrating an elaborate cover-up of the abuse. According to police, she had tried to prevent an investigation by instructing staff not to report the incident. She asked employees at the assisted living facility, Beau Provence Memory Care, to hand over all evidence to her, which she then allegedly destroyed. The chef, Jerry Kan, was indicted on a first first-degree rape charge and has pleaded not guilty. The case is ongoing and his attorney declined to comment.

Henry has not been indicted, and her case is under review. Henry's attorney said he is confident the continued investigation will result in her exoneration. ""The resident and the cook, Mr. Kan, initially denied anything had occurred, creating confusion as to whether this was a reportable incident. When it was learned that an incident had occurred, Ms. Henry cooperated fully with the police and continues to do so,"" he said in an email. Beau Provence said it was working with police and the state health department to ""verify the facts behind these allegations,"" but said it could not comment further on an ongoing investigation.

Even in facilities where there were no allegations of an orchestrated cover-up, documents examined by CNN showed a failure to preserve evidence. A resident who alleged abuse would be given a shower, for instance, or the crime scene might be disturbed by the washing of bedsheets. As a result, possible DNA evidence was lost.

In Minnesota, officials transferred an 89-year-old resident at the Edgewood Vista assisted living facility to the psychiatric ward of a local hospital after she reported being raped. A certified nursing assistant, Andrew Merzwski, 28, admitted to having sex with the resident but claimed it was consensual. A director at the facility believed him and blamed the victim -- who suffered from dementia -- telling the sexual assault nurse who examined the victim that the resident was a ""flirt.""

""She (had) come forward and spoken out against her facility and she was locked in a room,"" the nurse examiner, Theresa Flesvig, told CNN. ""She felt like she was in prison. She felt like she was being punished."" Her rape examination didn't occur until almost a week after the alleged assault. Flesvig said she discovered clear physical evidence of assault, one of the largest vaginal tears she had ever seen. Merzwski pleaded guilty to criminal sexual conduct and was sentenced in 2014 to 53 months in prison, while the state disciplined the official who had sided with him. Merzwski's attorney declined to comment.

The facility said it couldn't comment on details of the specific case, citing privacy reasons, but did acknowledge that officials had learned from the incident. ""What we learned was we weren't prepared for anything of this nature,"" said Michael Johnson, chief nursing officer for Edgewood Management Group. ""We had to do better.""

Sometimes police and state investigators also fail to take complaints seriously. In one instance, a police report reviewed by CNN cited an administrator's statement that the victim was an ""avid viewer of the television show 'Law and Order'"" as a reason to dismiss her allegation. ""Hallucinations seem to revolve around episodes of the series,"" the officer wrote. As a result, there were no arrests, the rape kit was not tested and the case was closed.

Inside the mind of a nursing home rapist

""The 'victim' of this investigation has made similar allegations regarding suspects that do not exist, are physically unable to have committed the act she accuses, etc.,"" the police department told CNN in a written statement. ""The 'victim' suffers from mental illness and hallucinations, her statements are inconsistent and unfounded.""

In the Minnesota case involving nursing aide Kpingbah, the state investigator wrote that the first alleged victim had a ""lengthy history of falsely accusing male caregivers of sexual inappropriateness"" and ""sexual promiscuity and inappropriate boundaries."" When CNN showed this victim's son the state's report, he said the characterizations were false.

Asked about this by CNN, the Minnesota Department of Health said the claims had been taken seriously and investigated. ""In hindsight and according to current report writing practices, MDH regrets the wording of this statement and apologizes to the family for this insensitive statement,"" the agency said.

While assailants such as Kpingbah have ended up behind bars as a result of their crimes, many never face charges.

The older the victim, the less likely an offender will be convicted of sexual abuse, according to a study of the elderly sponsored by the National Institute of Justice. And victims who lived in facilities were even less likely to see their assailants face charges and guilty verdicts.

In fact, victims with dementia and other diseases are often considered such unreliable witnesses that even cases in which an assailant confesses to the crime can end up being thrown out or result in little punishment for the defendant. That was true in the case of Walter Martinez, a St. Louis nursing aide who faced felony rape charges and years in prison after confessing in a resignation letter to abusing two elderly residents sexually. Martinez ended up receiving two years of probation after the alleged victims died or suffered from such severe dementia that they weren't able to testify.

His attorney told CNN that despite the resignation letter, Martinez had never pleaded guilty to the conduct he was charged with and was prepared to defend himself in court. ""Mr. Martinez had gone to counseling and admitted that he had sexual thoughts while performing his regular job duties. He felt tremendous guilt for having these thoughts and that is when he used the term 'sexual abuse' in his resignation letter,"" he said in an email.

In the case of the Texas woman who saved her bra for weeks as evidence, a suspect was arrested and indicted in the alleged rape. But court records show that prosecutors couldn't secure the alleged victim's testimony. The case was dismissed last year despite the fact the DNA from the bra matched a sample taken from the accused. The lab said the chances of the DNA being from anyone else was less than 1 in 983 trillion.

Even those facilities that actively impede investigations or cover up abuse often get little more than a slap on the wrist. The vast majority of nursing homes with horror stories chronicled in the inspection reports are still in business, accepting new residents today.

She was as vulnerable as an infant when she was raped.

""How hard is it to shut one down? It is almost impossible,"" said Tony Chicotel, a staff attorney at the nonprofit group California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. ""The worst nightmare for the state regulators is a facility closing -- because the residents oftentimes have no place to go.""

So instead, government regulators levy fines and withhold Medicare and Medicaid payments in the hope of getting facilities in line. But even when penalties are imposed, which the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services says are meant to push a facility to correct a given issue as soon as possible, the fines are often shockingly small.

When a facility in Texas failed to take proper action after an elderly man said he was raped and drugged, authorities punished the home with a $116,500 fine and by temporarily banning it from receiving government reimbursements for new patients. But the fine was ultimately cut almost in half, based on the facility's ""financial hardship."" And the ban lasted only 11 days.

A facility in California -- which allowed a licensed nurse to work for weeks despite reports he had sexually assaulted a female resident multiple times, kissing her and fondling her breasts -- was fined $22,000 by the state.

And then there is Walker Methodist in Minnesota, where 83-year-old Sonja Fischer became the victim of the same kind of violent assault she had fled so many years ago. There she was raped by an employee the facility knew had been the subject of abuse allegations for years.

""She was unable to speak, unable to move,"" her daughter Maya recounted just a few weeks after her mother passed away last year. ""She couldn't even cry out when this was happening to her.""

The facility where she was victimized received no penalty at all.

CNN's Ana Cabrera, Sara Weisfeldt, David Heath, Sergio Hernandez and Andrew Bloomenthal contributed to this report.

Published on February 22, 2017",
My mother was raped in a nursing home at 88,"Bobbi Young holds a photo of her mother, Marilyn Young, the day after she passed away at home in Carmel Valley, California.

(CNN) I scanned my mother's bed, pulled back the rumpled sheets and uncovered her shivering naked body. I stared at her bruised inner thighs, her sheets wet with urine and blood, her catheter pulled completely out of her. I covered her with a blanket and held her close as she pleaded, ""Get me out of here.""

I kissed her forehead, our tears mixing, and promised no one was going to stop me. She would not spend another night in this nursing home.

I pushed the call button. No response. I followed the cord to the wall and found it disconnected. My heart racing, I tracked down an aide and demanded that a nurse come to my mother's room immediately. At 88, she was examined with nonchalance and covered back up.

I called the manager to her room and told her I was taking Mom home.

The nursing staff gathered in force, attempting to convince me that her release was a long process, that my mother could still benefit from their help. Her stay in the nursing home had been a temporary transition needed after being hospitalized with a stroke.

But I knew my mother had been harmed. I feared the worse. And I feared for her life if she stayed there.

I called her doctor to sign a release form, and I phoned a service for private medical transport. I also called my husband and said, ""I need to bring Mom home with us today. Go get Daddy.""

At the front door of the nursing home, the management staff lined up to wish us well. They invited us to come back and visit.

""Thank you,"" I told them, ""but we will never drive by this road again.""

When we arrived home, the driver unloaded my bundled mother and the rain momentarily stopped. I looked up and saw my father, his hand pressed to the window, tears in his eyes and mouthing the words ""Mama ... Mama's home."" Married 69 years, my parents experienced every second apart as an eternity.

Once settled in their own bed, Daddy curled up next to Mother, held her hand, prayed with her, assured her she was OK now, home safe. She was still recovering from her stroke, and even though my father sensed some harm had come to her, he didn't ask. He didn't want to stress her more. He never left her side.

Medical equipment, photos of happier times and leftover Christmas decorations fill Marilyn Young's bedroom.

Over the weeks that followed, my mother complained of pain in her groin area. Doctors increased the doses of pain medication, but she still awoke in anguish, day after day. I finally had to examine her -- and my heart sank.

I knew she needed to be seen by her gynecologist as soon as possible.

A nurse practitioner examined my mother and ran tests to confirm her suspicions: a sexually transmitted disease. Had my mother shown these symptoms before, she asked. The answer was no. Had my mother had any sexual partners besides my father in her lifetime? The answer was no.

When I told her about what had happened in the nursing home, the nurse said my father would need to be tested for the disease. My mother was visibly shaken. I asked the nurse, if my father was negative, what would be the next step? She said, you need to call the California Department of Public Health and file a report.

We drove home silently. My mind struggled with how much my mother had been through; now we were minutes away from devastating my father. I asked if she wanted my help in telling Daddy. The answer was yes.

As I spoke, Daddy didn't hesitate to agree to be tested. Then he asked what all of this meant. What would proving he was negative for the disease mean?

Mama, her voice choked with sadness, replied: ""I was raped.""

My father held my mother, crying, shaking his head in disbelief and apologizing for not being able to keep her safe.

I grew up believing my parents were strong and took comfort trusting I would always be safe. They both worked two or three jobs throughout my childhood to buy me and my siblings encyclopedias to enhance our knowledge of the world long before Google existed.

Witnessing this wound inflicted on my parents cut deeply to the core of my own foundation. The hospital had recommended the nursing home as a transitional step; her own internist was the director of the facility: What could possibly go wrong?

There were no warning flags. We failed to protect her against something we could not even imagine existed. A distress signal is only as good as the person who sees it. When I saw it, I took action. But it was too late.

For months, my parents comforted each other, not wanting to be even a foot apart. Their love never wavered; it only deepened. I would walk past their bedroom and see them snuggled tightly together, whispering. My father later told me they were praying and planning to renew their wedding vows on their 70th anniversary.

Beyond the harm the perpetrator had inflicted on my mother, he took a toll on my father's remaining strength and stole some of the precious time my parents had left. Still, together they decided to fight for reform, which my husband and I fully supported. We filed a civil lawsuit against the facility, arguing that more should have been done to protect my mother. She was brave enough to appear at the center of a public service video created by a nonprofit calling for nursing home reform.

After taking her mother into her own home, Bobbi Young cared for her until Marilyn passed away in January.

Two months before my father passed away at 95, he told my mother his time was near and asked my husband and I to help them renew their vows early. They exchanged their promises tearfully and glowed with renewed divinity. He did not live long enough to see my mother receive a settlement in her case against the nursing home.

On the day my father died, my husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. His painful journey ended 17 months later. But our commitment to choose love and joy enabled Mother and I to embrace our faith and carry on. I promised my husband I would not be sad or bitter. I had promised my father I would care for Mama and keep her safe.

I feared that I would not be able to fulfill those promises.

But there are moments in life that transcend fear. They mend twisted hearts. This became one of those moments.

After my husband's funeral, all of my mother's nurturing traits intensified. I had promised to care for her, and now she was providing me with what felt like a second childhood. She took the reins, suggesting remedies such as extra locks on doors and an alarm system to quiet our fears. She reminded me of recipes to help stretch our dollars to survive -- such as making ""imagination cookies."" When I looked sad, she would talk about funny things my husband did to make her laugh. We prayed together, planned our spring garden, went for drives on hot days with the windows down, hair blowing in the wind, laughing with memories.

I promised my mother I would honor her vow to carry on her courageous battle for justice all the days of my life by telling her story. While her perpetrator will likely never be found, it was one of her last wishes for people to understand that no one is too old to become a victim of rape.

My mother died in January. She was 94. As I walk around my home now, I look at the empty rocking chair in which she soothed her children. I can feel her brushing my long hair. The seedlings she planted in eggshells on Christmas Day are bursting toward spring. I can hear her laughter and her reminder to me: ""The gifts God gave you, he did not give to another; respect them and share them wisely. ...""

Who was this woman in my life? Why was she made to suffer so?

An answer fills my sorrowful heart:

Suffering can carve two types of people, monsters and angels. I am fortunate to have been raised by angels. And I pray to one day be worthy of that divine fabric that still holds me tightly together -- love.

Caregiver convicted of rape in nursing home,"(CNN) At first, no one believed them when they said the charming, well-liked aide in the nursing home where they lived had raped them.

Claims like theirs are often dismissed as drug-induced hallucinations, signs of dementia or attempts by lonely residents to get attention. And even when the cases of nursing home residents get to court, they can fall apart when victims' memories prove unreliable -- or they are no longer alive to testify.

This time was different.

The two women made their way to the courthouse in Waynesville, North Carolina, last week to testify against the man entrusted with their care.

One entered the courtroom in her wheelchair, two oxygen tanks behind her, and defiantly described the February night when 58-year-old Luis Gomez lifted up her nightgown. He had entered her room at the Brian Center, a nursing home in the center of town, when she was alone and asked if she needed to go the bathroom. She said she did, and climbed out of bed. As she entered the bathroom and faced the toilet, she heard the door close and lock. Then, she said, Gomez raped her.

At first, no one acted on her accusation, and she feared Gomez might appear in her room again at any moment. But when a nurse insisted on notifying police -- against the wishes of her boss -- the call triggered an investigation. And women just down the hall from the resident came forward, with their own allegations against Gomez.

Now he has been sentenced to at least 23 years behind bars.

""What this man has done for a period of almost a decade is ... prey on Alzheimer's patients because they're forgetful and they can't remember and oftentimes they die,"" the prosecutor told the judge during sentencing.

""In 2016, Your Honor, he made the grave mistake of hurting the wrong woman. She was brave enough to tell, and she wouldn't be quiet until everybody listened. And because of her, that's the only reason that we are finally able to put him in prison.""

After a weeklong trial, Gomez was found guilty of raping both women who testified against him -- convicted on six counts that included forcible rape with a physically helpless victim. He still maintains his innocence, and is appealing the verdict.

What should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken

At his sentencing, the prosecutor said the two women who testified against him were not his only victims.

Six others have accused him, she said. At three different facilities in the area. Some were in their 50s and 60s. At least one was nearly 90.

None were believed, until the woman who was raped in her nightgown came forward. Gomez's attorney told jurors they shouldn't believe her either.

""He told me I'm untruthful, and I said, no I am not,"" the victim, now 55, said of the lawyer's questioning. ""He made me feel like I was a worm crawling on the ground."" CNN does not typically identify victims of sexual abuse.

The weeklong trial of Luis Gomez took place at the Haywood County Courthouse in Waynesville.

Gomez's attorney, Joel Schechet, told the court that his client is a ""good man"" who came to America after almost dying from an assault in Guatemala. ""To this day, I would contend he never committed an act that was inappropriate to any of these people making these allegations,"" he said, adding that had the jury found him innocent,Gomez was prepared to leave the country and return home.

The Brian Center paid a six-figure fine after regulators found it had failed to protect residents from sexual abuse. A spokesperson for its parent company said it was pleased the case was over and that it had been unaware of the multiple allegations against Gomez until the police investigation began.

Months before the trial, a CNN investigation into sexual abuse at nursing homes had discovered many of these same accusations against Gomez at three different nursing facilities in Haywood County. At least some had been reported to the state.

But because investigators were unable to substantiate any of the complaints, Gomez's record remained clean and he continued work as a nursing aide.

Asked whether the Gomez case would spur change, such as a way to track a pattern of unsubstantiated complaints against nursing home employees, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has said the agency is simply following federal and state laws.

They refused to comment on just how many times Gomez was investigated in the past. But in court, the prosecutor ticked off each accusation, one by one:

In 2011, years before Gomez worked at the Brian Center, a woman with severe Alzheimer's said he had touched her inappropriately while cleaning her up at another nursing home in town, prompting a law enforcement investigation. At first, she insisted it had happened. But then she said, ""Well, maybe I'm confused.""

Two years later, a resident at yet another nursing home screamed when she awoke to Gomez touching her. She was living in the Alzheimer's wing, even though she didn't suffer from the condition.

The following year, an Alzheimer's patient at the same facility reported that he had pressed her ""down there."" But she said she was ""afraid"" and didn't want to get him in trouble. She has since passed away.

After that, the accusations started piling up at the Brian Center.

Nursing aide Luis Gomez most recently lived in this house, according to property records.

In 2015, a resident said Gomez touched her breasts and told her he wanted to marry her. Another woman, who'd suffered a stroke, told staff that Gomez molested her. She was promptly committed to the psychiatric unit of the local hospital. Within months, a different woman insisted Gomez had touched her while changing her diaper, but said that no one believed her. And yet another said she had silently endured weeks of sexual abuse that left her terrified.

The woman who said he raped her in the bathroom was his eighth accuser.

Before the judge sentenced Gomez, the victim asked to have a word with him. The sheriff wheeled her up to face him. Then she spoke.

""The Lord loves you,"" she told her attacker. ""Even though what you did is wrong, the Good Book says that I must love you, even though you did me wrong; and I do. I love you, and I pray that the others learn to forgive you and love you as I have. May you go in peace.""

Gomez sat silently and cried, she said.

She returned to the Brian Center, where she says memories of her abuse still haunt her. The day of the verdict, she said, was the best day of her life.

She was finally believed.

""It felt like a ton of bricks were off my shoulders,"" said the woman, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. ""I wanted to scream in the courtroom, 'Yeehaw!'""

News of the verdict quickly made its way around town, reaching another woman who had accused Gomez of sexual abuse -- the stroke victim who had been sent to the psych ward.

The stroke victim sent to the psychiatric ward after accusing Gomez of molesting her says his sentence is not enough.

""I was glad that people did believe it, and something was done about it,"" she said, speaking on the phone from the facility where she lives now, many miles from the Brian Center. But she wasn't satisfied with the outcome. ""What he did was a lot worse than what he's paying for.""

The nurse who supervised Gomez and defied her boss by triggering the police investigation said she, too, was also glad the victims were believed. Even if her life has been upended.

She said she suffered panic attacks for months leading up to the trial. She was fired from the Brian Center days after notifying police, and she said she plans to sue the facility to make a statement: that nurses will not be forced to act unethically.

""I couldn't live with myself if I did not make the call,"" said 36-year-old Krista Shalda. ""I could not go to bed at night if I knew I was the reason someone was getting sexually assaulted.""

She doubts she will ever work in a nursing home again. Facilities are reluctant to hire a whistleblower, she said. She also knows that she wouldn't be able to stop herself from worrying about what could be happening behind closed doors.",2017-08-20 00:00:00
How artificial intelligence and robots can change your living spaces,"Written by By Oscar Holland, CNN

Dutch designer Joris Laarman has built his career through emerging technologies like 3D printing and robotics.

But as a student 15 years ago, he didn't even own a computer.

""After my graduation I got a computer, which changed everything,"" he said in a phone interview. ""My generation was the first to know what it was like before computers, but who also grew up with them.""

Now the 37-year-old can't work without one. From open source furniture designs to a 3D-printed footbridge made from stainless steel, Laarman's work lies at the intersection of design and technology.

His company, Joris Laarman Lab , pushes at the experimental edges of an industry that has digitalized rapidly since he graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 2003.

""We're trying to figure out what the design of the future will be -- what it could look like,"" he said.

Digital toolbox

One of Laarman's best-known designs is the Bone Chair, which was created through algorithms that mimic bone growth. Using a large volume of computer-generated calculations, Laarman's program systematically adjusted and strengthened the chair's design.

""Birds' bones have super-optimal construction -- they constantly adapt themselves by taking away material where it's not needed and adding material where it is, without losing strength,"" he explained.

""To me, an algorithm is just a new high-tech version of a saw or a pair of scissors -- it's just a tool. The designs that we make are never finished objects, they're more like programs that we can tweak into new forms and adapt themselves accordingly.""

Technology is not only changing designers' methods, but also the type of products they can create. More than a simple efficiency measure, Laarman says that digitalization makes entirely new concepts possible.

""(The shape of the Bone Chair) could never have been invented without the algorithm. You'd need really heavy calculations for such an evolutionary process.

""If you were to do this manually, without a computer, you'd have to break the legs of the chair thousands of times to make it stronger and to know where to add or take away material.""

Design to download

The Bone Chair is set to go on display at the New York's Cooper Hewitt, The Smithsonian Design Museum , alongside other highlights from Laarman's career, including a set of tables made from reprogrammable molecular building blocks called voxels.

The exhibition, titled "" Joris Laarman Lab: Design in the Digital Age ,"" encourages visitors to interact with technologies that may soon become commonplace, said the show's curator Andrea Lipps.

""(Experimental) designers often end up creating things that are so completely foreign that they become almost indigestible,"" she said. ""What's interesting about Joris' work is that there's a familiarity to it that makes it feel less threatening. These designers are the early adopters -- they're taking our hand and leading us into the future.""

While Lipps wants the exhibition to be an ""interactive, participatory experience,"" visitors won't get a chance to sit on any of Laarman's chairs. They will, however, be able to download some of the design blueprints.

""You can download one (of the chairs) for free and make it yourself -- or have it produced by your neighbor if they have a 3D printer,"" Laarman said. ""There are now platforms that show where the 3D printers in your neighborhood are.""

The 'next industrial revolution'

This tools used by Laarman are just some of the digital methods transforming the design industry. Robotics, 3D printing and virtual reality are all changing the way products are made -- from super-strong digitally fabricated materials to cars designed in thin air using VR goggles.

According to research by the consulting firm McKinsey, the cost of 3D printing fell 60 percent between 1990 and 2014, while the price of industrial robots fell by 5 percent every year between 2000 and 2012.

This move from industrial to digital production represents a fundamental shift in the economy of design, said Laarman, comparing the transition to the industrial revolution.

""Modernists in the early 20th century were developing new form languages for the dawn of a new industrial period. It was very much dependent on standardization and geometric shapes.

""Right now, you can see digital fabrication is taking off and this leads to a completely new type of form language. It's still very early, but everybody sees the potential. Digital design, biotechnology, AI and robotics are going to completely change everything in the world, at every level of society. It's very important to start working on it.""

""Joris Laarman Lab: Design in the Digital Age"" will be exhibited at Cooper Hewitt, The Smithsonian Design Museum from 27 September 2017 to 14 January 2018",
Deciphering the hidden meanings of Japanese tattoos,"Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNN

Favored by hardened yakuza gang members and law-abiding body art purists alike, large-scale Japanese tattoos are widely celebrated for their distinctive style, mythological motifs and vibrant coloring.

But while many of the common motifs are steeped in history and folklore, Japan's pictorial tattooing tradition is relatively new. Before the Edo period (c.1615-1868), tattoos were primarily used as crude markers of punishment for petty criminals or of fealty for lovers, or else the domain of the indigenous Ainu tribes of the northern islands.

According to ""Tattoos in Japanese Prints,"" a new publication from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it was only in the 19th century that they were elevated to the level of art.

Author Sarah E. Thompson, curator of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, traces their popularity back to the publication of ""One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Water Margin,"" a series of woodblock prints by the artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, between 1827 and 1830.

His prints, adapted from a 14th-century Chinese novel, saw bandit heroes covered with elaborate, full-body tattoos rendered in impressive detail. The common motifs -- dragons and demons, fearsome predators, koi fish and cherry blossoms -- were laden with meaning, and added another layer to the narrative.

Here he's depicted three actors in various roles, their tattoos meant to evoke characters from the books and plays of the day. Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston

""By emphasizing the tattoos sported by some of the heroes, Kuniyoshi's print designs not only exploited the allure of the exotic but also provided a titillating hint of the illicit -- especially if the suggestion that pictorial tattoos in Japan had been outlaws and spread to fashionable urbanites is correct,"" Thompson writes.

The impact of the ""Water Margin"" series and similar works from Kuniyoshi and his contemporaries was immediate and broad-reaching. Men across class lines requested tattoos of scenes from ""Water Margins"" -- and, in some cases, the characters' tattoos. Textile artists started incorporating tattoo-like prints into their designs; kabuki stars painted simple designs onto their skin for performances.

(The tattoos did have their detractors, however. In 1872, as Japan started its push toward Westernization, tattoos were banned by the Japanese government, who considered them uncivilized and old-fashioned. This ban was lifted after the American occupation after WWII.)

""It is uncertain whether Kuniyoshi was responding to a recent craze for extensive pictorial tattoos, or whether -- as suggested by oral tradition among present-day tattoo artists -- it was the prints themselves that inspired the new fashion,"" Thompson writes.

""Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between: large tattoos were already beginning to appear, but it was Kuniyoshi who transformed a temporary fad into a lasting art form.""",
The naked truth,"(CNN) Behind the double-mastectomy scars that run across her bare chest, she had a story to tell.

So late last April, Paulette Leaphart embarked on a 1,000-mile walk from her childhood hometown of Biloxi, Mississippi, to the halls of Congress in Washington.

And she did it topless.

The breast cancer survivor screamed for a cure and demanded better and more affordable health care. She wanted women without breasts to believe in their beauty and be proud of their strength. By showcasing and embracing her scars, she hoped to inspire others to do the same.

Her journey was bold, visual, moving. It offered a hero to admire and, given Paulette's audacious decision to walk shirtless in the face of strangers, a rich spectacle to witness. It spoke to African-American women, who face the highest breast cancer mortality rate. It inspired legions of survivors. And it spoke to many who'd lost someone to the disease.

It seemed a storyteller's dream. But reality would eventually intrude.

Documentary filmmakers were first to seize on Paulette's potential -- after she approached a producer who was out on a shoot, lifted up her shirt and said her story needed to be told. A stunning trailer for ""Scar Story,"" in which the film crew would follow her entire walk, was released in late October 2015.

A Kickstarter campaign to help fund the film went up weeks before the walk began, attracting enthusiastic donors. Journalists flocked to Paulette, eager to tell her story. Even megastar Beyoncé took notice and featured Paulette in ""Lemonade.""

I saw the trailer on Facebook and, like so many others, was hooked. In a world hungry for heroes, whose stories of inspiration bring us light amid darkness, Paulette seemed to feed that craving. After making a few calls and learning she was walking with her 8-year-old daughter, no less, I hopped in my car, picked up my amateur photographer stepson, and headed to North Carolina to walk with her.

Some stories land on a journalist's plate like manna from heaven. They're perfect morsels you can't wait to share. Others arrive a mess of ingredients with no recipe to follow. This one started the first way and finished the other.

After walking with Paulette for a full day, I left with more questions than answers. No matter how much I hated to admit it, aspects of her story simply didn't add up. And the more I kept digging, the more inconsistencies I found: about her past and her cancer treatment, about how much she was actually walking, even about her motivations.

Part of me wanted to walk away -- from Paulette and the story. If even one woman's life was saved thanks to a conversation Paulette started, wasn't that enough? So what if our hero was flawed?

But then I thought about the thousands of people following Paulette on Facebook, all the journalists who covered her journey and the online video viewed more than 20 million times.

And I realized: This story wasn't just about Paulette. It's about our need to find -- and, for some of us, become -- heroes. It's about the unchecked storytelling and self-promotion that thrives on social media. It's about the disappointment we feel when reality jolts us awake from our reverie.

In our desperation to believe in people, do we dole out passes too easily? Had we, in our collective enchantment with Paulette, all become blind?

Shameka Fulston, left, and others join Paulette Leaphart for a community walk in Charlotte. Fulston planned to rejoin Paulette for the last 100 miles of her walk but left Charlotte feeling disenchanted.

A vision from God

I caught up with Paulette at a house outside Charlotte, North Carolina, where she and her daughter were staying. The grill was fired up, food filled the counters and the music was pumping. Paulette, who wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""Living beautifully,"" greeted me with a hug.

""The walk has given me back everything the devil stole from me,"" she told those in the room, as they gathered to pray for her journey.

The hostess said she opened her home because she'd lost her own sister to breast cancer. As her tears fell, she told Paulette, ""That's why I wanted to take care of you.""

Dusk turned to night, and I kept my eye on the time. When we spoke by phone, Paulette had warned me she woke up at 4:30 each morning and walked 20 to 40 miles each day except weekends, which were for rest. She had to cover that sort of ground, she explained, if she wanted to meet her goal of reaching Washington by June 27, her 50th birthday. I'm in decent shape, but walking at least 20 miles on little sleep scared me.

""Oh, we're not starting 'til 9 a.m. tomorrow,"" Paulette finally told me as the night wore on. A community walk was planned in downtown Charlotte. I breathed a sigh of relief.

The next morning, the crowd was passionate but small -- about three dozen women, men and children. Many wore pink , and most had been touched by breast cancer.

""Five years in October,"" said one woman. ""Nine years cancer-free,"" said another, sporting a ""Fight Like a Girl"" T-shirt. ""Mom died in 2004,"" said one man, who survived lymphoma himself.

A woman who'd driven through the night to be here took off her shirt to reveal her own tangled scars. She'd seen Paulette in Atlanta and vowed to walk with her.

After photos, videos and prayers, the walkers hit the pavement, weaving their way through downtown. ""We need a cure! We need a cure!"" they screamed, following Paulette's lead. ""Breast cancer sucks! Breast cancer sucks!"" They also sang hymns.

""We will walk until we defeat this demon!"" Paulette yelled.

All the pain I felt from the day I was born had purpose, and I'm living that purpose. God said I'm going to use your chest. Paulette Leaphart

It was Memorial Day, one month to the day since she started, and the streets were quiet. Occasional onlookers gawked, wondering what the commotion was about. I walked along taking notes and wondered myself: How effective was this small, 1-mile march, really?

I was more interested in what would come next: the walk she was resuming with her daughter to reach Washington in less than a month.

They had already covered 710 miles. They'd walked all but 100 of them, Paulette said. She said she often used cabs to carry her through dangerous parts of the journey. With most weekends off, that would mean they'd averaged more than 27 miles a day on foot.

We got started around noon. I'd pictured us rambling through rolling hills of green. Paulette would be like Forrest Gump, I thought, gathering disciples as she strode through quaint towns.

Paulette preferred a busier route and steered us toward US 29. In her mind it was safer, and only along highways could she and her message be seen. She carried no sign, insisting the scars told her story.

To her 5,000 friends and thousands more followers on Facebook, Paulette was already a hero. They showered her with love and praise.

""If I had 10,000 thousand tongues, I couldn't thank you enough,"" one person wrote the day after I walked with her. ""I understand your fight! God is with you every step of the way.""

""I love you for what you are doing,"" wrote another. ""You are so brave you are my WOMAN OF THE YEAR.""

""You are such a phenomenal woman,"" wrote a third. ""I lost my mother to breast cancer but I know if she were alive, she would be walking with you -- the whole way. ... God bless you.""

Paulette has inspired women all over the world and said she has even saved lives. People who'd been considering suicide, she said, were motivated by her to go on.

The global attention began two years earlier, when, over Labor Day weekend, she posted topless photos of herself on a beach in Mississippi. She had just emerged from eight months of depression after losing her breasts and being told she couldn't have reconstructive surgery because of a pre-existing blood-clotting disorder. She says she had a vision from God to go to Biloxi Beach, take off her shirt and be photographed.

She said people surrounded her. A woman began to cry and then she did, too. Onlookers applauded. Paulette freed herself in that moment and, in posting photos on Facebook, did the same for others. She said a man wrote to thank her, saying that his wife, who'd lost her breasts years before, had finally bared her chest for him.

She was chosen by God to be a vessel for his work, she said, and her photos were ""liked"" almost 300,000 times. It was God who woke her up one night in December 2013 to tell her she had breast cancer, which doctors later confirmed. And it was God who told her to go on this 1,000-mile topless walk.

""All the pain I felt from the day I was born had purpose, and I'm living that purpose,"" she said. ""God said I'm going to use your chest.""

Pushing her daughter in a weighed-down stroller, Paulette Leaphart winds her way out of downtown Charlotte to continue her journey toward Washington.

The first signs

Based on the expressions of the people we passed, not everyone saw the purpose. She joked that she must look like a bag lady to some. Others got what this was about and offered her cheers and hugs. A church group giving out toiletries to homeless people gathered her in a circle for prayers. Two women on bikes who'd seen her story rode up and passed her $20 bills.

Paulette had said she only ate fruit when she walked. On this day, though, she ate fried chicken tenders from Popeyes and two hot dogs at Cook Out, a Southern fast-food chain. I wasn't judging her choices; I matched everything she ate and then some. But she didn't eat the apple I offered, and I never saw her eat a piece of fruit.

It was one of those tiny, perhaps silly, observations I filed away. But aren't we all guilty of saying and doing different things, especially when it comes to diet?

The heat had slowed her down. She said she was now aiming for 20 miles a day, news that came as a relief. It was late afternoon, though, and we hadn't even gone 10 miles. Sometimes her daughter trudged along with us. More often, she climbed into a stroller built for kids less than half her size. Bags spilled over the sides; one balanced across her lap. Several times the awkward contraption tumbled over when she was getting in or out.

While picking up her scattered belongings -- an overstuffed wallet, sunscreen and bug spray, water bottles and her daughter's ""Jesus Storybook Bible"" -- Paulette told me she'd already lost her driver's license and passport.

""How do you check into hotels?"" I asked, knowing desk clerks always ask for ID. ""Everyone knows who I am,"" she answered with a smile. I made another mental note.

The highway we walked along grew busy. When Paulette's daughter was out of the stroller, I often caught myself holding my breath as cars whizzed by.

In the hottest part of the day, she took breaks. Sometimes, she said, she and her daughter studied. Other times, they found a place to swim, catch a movie or visit a garden. On the day I walked with her, we went bowling.

Paulette was on her phone often and obsessed with charging it wherever we stopped. She wasn't making calls as much as checking Facebook. She seemed consumed with monitoring likes, shares and comments. I asked if anyone on the Internet ever put her down.

Only one, she said: a woman she didn't know who was spreading lies and had a criminal record. A woman she suspected was crazy and jealous. A woman she was determined to ignore.

What about the documentary group who'd set out to follow her? What had happened to them? Paulette told me they'd made money off her story without her consent and left after just a few days, abandoning her and her daughter ""like dogs on the side of the road.""

Paulette often described her undertaking as ""a walk of faith"" and said Jesus has always been with her. When she was a small child, she said, she was sexually, physically and emotionally abused. Her great-grandmother gave her a Bible. She said it was the first book she ever read.

""She couldn't protect me, but she gave me something that would.""

After one particularly brutal beating, Paulette said, she promised God that if he let her live, she'd dedicate her life to taking care of children. She has eight; she said she gave birth to four and adopted four others. Over the years, she said, she's fostered hundreds more.

Her older kids were caring for her teens during the walk, she said. Her youngest, whom she said she home schools, refused to be left behind. When Paulette was at her lowest point fighting cancer, she said, her daughter pushed her to battle on.

""There were days I wanted to stop breathing. She'd climb up into my bed and love all over me. She'd say, 'Mama, promise me you're going to beat cancer.' I promised her and I kept it.""

The highway we walked along grew busy. When Paulette's daughter was out of the stroller, I often caught myself holding my breath as cars whizzed by. When the shoulder narrowed, Paulette simply walked on the road.

""I force them to respect me.""

Fear, she insisted, was nothing more than the devil. She said God would protect her and her daughter. I hoped God would also remember me.

Salvation came for us in the form of a flat stroller tire. The weighed down contraption now moved like lead.

Paulette had asked for help pushing it throughout the day, and I was happy to oblige in spurts. But now, unless she could fix it, this day looked done.

An auto shop tried to help but couldn't. A taxi ride took us to the other side of an interstate.

I left her at Cook Out and took an Uber back to my car. She planned to wait with her daughter for a ride back to the house where she'd been staying. She had miles to make up, she said, and needed to get to Walmart to buy a new stroller so she could pick up where she left off first thing in the morning.

Our day ended as the sun began to set. We'd logged less than 14 miles.

The ""Scar Story"" trailer was widely shared on social media and gained the attention of journalists, as well as Beyoncé, who featured Paulette in ""Lemonade.""

Paulette's financial woes

As more local, national and international reporters told Paulette's story, my reservations mounted.

One local TV reporter wrote online that Beyoncé had walked with Paulette, though it was later trimmed from the piece. Another referred to her as a social worker, a career that, up until this point, she hadn't mentioned to me. When I'd asked Paulette what kind of work she'd done, she only mentioned owning a successful day care center in Virginia -- which, she said, she'd sold years before for a profit. She became homeless, she said, when medical expenses mounted from two years of cancer treatment. She had to choose between having a roof over her head or fighting to get well.

I wondered how many of these journalists actually spent a full day with her; besides the filmmakers, Paulette had told me I was the first. Was I a horrible person for not buying her story wholesale?

I know we're all vulnerable in this time of Internet hoaxes and fake news. Remember the recent story of a Santa Claus in Tennessee who claimed an ailing 5-year-old boy died in his arms? The world went nuts over this tearjerker, the story went viral, and none of it was publicly corroborated by anyone other than Santa.

I got teary-eyed when I saw Santa's story, and when I first learned about Paulette's I was similarly taken. It's who I am as a person; I want to believe. But as a journalist my job is to ask questions and pull on those loose threads of doubt. So I enlisted a CNN researcher to pull up a background report on Paulette.

That's when her story began to unravel.

She found a way for people to feel sorry for her, a way to collect money and notoriety. Barbara Smith, who won part of a $100,000 judgment against Paulette

It turns out her financial struggles long predated cancer. Years before Paulette said God woke her up to say she had breast cancer, there'd been more than a half dozen civil judgments and liens against her totaling well over $100,000. She'd filed for bankruptcy, owed the IRS about $45,000 and had faced multiple evictions.

The bulk of the civil judgments stemmed from the Virginia day care center, which Paulette had owned for less than two years. I spoke to Barbara Smith, who said she and a friend were bilked out of more than $60,000 after Paulette persuaded them to invest in the day care center and become her partners. They agreed that Smith and the friend, who knew Paulette from church, would later take over the business from Paulette, which she had valued at $200,000. But she'd been dishonest about the state of her day care center, was in the hole and hadn't even been paying rent on the building, Smith said. The pair lost everything they gave Paulette.

""We were investing in something that wasn't even there,"" said Smith, who admitted they were too trusting. ""She just kind of shrugged it off as if we knew what we were getting into.""

Court documents show that Paulette had defaulted on her lease and had ""fraudulently represented"" the worth of her business. Paulette ""declined to cooperate with her counsel and failed to appear for trial,"" the court order read.

The plaintiffs were awarded more than $100,000, but they ""never saw a red cent,"" Smith said. Paulette filed for bankruptcy a few days later.

When media reports about Paulette's 1,000-mile walk began appearing, Smith said she and her friend were only temporarily surprised. Knowing her the way they did, this was just another ""newfangled idea of how to get money,"" Smith said.

""She found a way for people to feel sorry for her, a way to collect money and notoriety.""

Paulette Leaphart captured the attention of young documentary filmmakers when she approached a producer, lifted up her shirt and said her story needed to be told.

A day with Beyoncé

It became clear, as I ambled along with her, that Paulette possessed an inflated sense of her fame.

She told me she imagined having her own reality TV show and a movie deal by the time her walk was over. She envisioned a career doing motivational speaking across the globe.

She spoke about Beyoncé as if they were friends and said the star had spent a whole day alone with her on the set of ""Lemonade."" She said Beyoncé wanted her daughter, Blue Ivy, to look up to women like her. She said Beyoncé had promised to walk with her for a mile.

I reached out a number of times to Beyoncé's publicist to ask about their relationship but never got a response.

Paulette predicted that by the time she arrived in Washington, thousands of women would join her. She said she'd been invited to walk in places as far-flung as Kenya and Jamaica and that she was a hero in Israel.

These seemingly over-the-top statements only made me question her further.

I knew she was struggling, and I worried about her. ... Part of me wanted to close the book on this story, leave it unwritten and move on.

I followed her daily on Facebook to see where she was and what she'd do or say next. Five days after I left her, she posted a picture of the stroller with the flat tire. The next day she posted a picture I'd seen her take with a man outside Charlotte. She was supposed to be nearing Durham at this point, around 150 miles away from where we said goodbye, and I couldn't help but wonder why she was still sharing shots from nearly a week earlier. I learned that she stayed in the house where I met her for five nights total -- two after we parted ways. After that, she seemed to take as many days off as she walked.

She visited with relatives and girlfriends and frolicked on a beach. She fell sick and rested. She phoned to tell me about circulation problems in her feet and cried about being bullied online. She put her walk on hold to travel up to Washington to attend The United State of Women Summit, hosted by first lady Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey, but didn't stay. The next day she posted photos of herself in a hospital bed, saying she was dehydrated.

I knew she was struggling, and I worried about her. I suspected the attention had derailed her initial mission, that she'd gotten in deeper than she could handle. I wondered if she was surrounded by people who no longer cared about her best interests. I feared there might be something bigger going on with her, that she might have other issues. Part of me wanted to close the book on this story, leave it unwritten and move on. Her journey now felt tragic and sad. What purpose would outing her discrepancies serve?

But I kept reminding myself Paulette put herself in the spotlight. Millions of people subscribed to her story, including plenty of journalists. Beyond notoriety, what else was she after? How was she affecting others? Maybe there was something to gain from digging deeper -- for all of us.

The trailer for ""Scar Story,"" a proposed documentary about Paulette Leaphart's 1,000-mile walk, was filmed in New Orleans, where Paulette lives.

Looking for direction

Part of what kept me going was what I learned about the documentary.

The filmmakers told me they'd spent seven months preparing for this venture. They said Paulette had signed off on the trailer and Kickstarter page and had been told time and again that the film crew's intention was to simply document her journey.

They thought they'd made it clear to Paulette that she would be responsible for her personal arrangements, logistics, support system and finances. As the departure date approached, they said, they kept checking to make sure her plans were on schedule. Paulette assured them she was ready.

The day they set out, the filmmakers learned that her plan was to lean on them. Director Emily MacKenzie said Paulette turned to her and asked, ""Which way should I go?""

""My heart sank,"" MacKenzie told me. ""In that moment when she said that, I felt betrayed and deeply worried.""

Paulette also insisted on bringing her daughter. The filmmakers had expressed concerns about this in earlier conversations. How would Paulette walk and care for her at the same time? She insisted she could handle it.

They agreed to help out in small ways; they'd gladly walk Paulette's daughter to the bathroom or make her a sandwich. But once the walk began, they said, Paulette wanted them to take on far more responsibility for her daughter than they'd discussed or agreed to -- and when they resisted, she grew furious.

They had a film to make and couldn't be liable for the welfare of a child, they told her.

I am sad to report that while we were with her on the road, the environment became hostile and unsafe for my team. Filmmaker Emily MacKenzie

Everything about the walk now made them nervous. Paulette got horrible blisters, even though she said she'd been training for more than a year. (Her explanation, on Facebook, was that she'd only trained on flat ground.) They spent three days with her -- covering 17, 11 and 9 miles -- and all signs pointed to disaster. Paulette blamed them for not being prepared. They'd put their lives on hold for a year for this project and were crushed, but felt they had no choice but to walk away.

They worried about Paulette and her daughter, though. They said they offered to drive them home to New Orleans, where Paulette lives, or at least take her daughter to relatives. They were in contact with one of Paulette's cousins, who was also concerned. They only left when they were assured loved ones were on the way.

Soon after their paths diverged, they said, Paulette's mileage seemed to quadruple. One day she boasted online about a full day of walking that, given the distance between her self-reported starting and stopping points, would have amounted to about 65 miles.

Finally, in June, MacKenzie posted a letter on the film's website on behalf of the team, telling supporters why the film's focus had changed to feature other women. She chose her words carefully.

""I am sad to report that while we were with her on the road, the environment became hostile and unsafe for my team. We realized the distressing truth that the terms under which we had agreed to film the documentary were false and that we would be in a compromised and legally liable position to stay on the road any longer. In good conscience, I could not keep my crew on the road. Hence, we are not filming further with Paulette.""

The attacks from Paulette's supporters were almost immediate.

You're going to be arrested for this. God knows what you did! How could you leave a homeless woman?

Someone reached out wondering how they could organize to buy Paulette a house. The filmmakers could only shake their heads. They'd been in Paulette's home. They knew she wasn't homeless.

When Paulette saw the letter she immediately threatened legal action, saying her lawyer would be in touch. The filmmakers never heard from an attorney.

A frequent presence on Facebook, Paulette Leaphart is a big fan of selfies. She posts glamour shots of herself frequently.

The A Team

At a certain point, beyond fact-checking Paulette's background, I knew I had to look into her online critics. That's when I learned about three women who call themselves The A Team. At the helm is Kimberly McCarty, Paulette's chief adversary, the woman Paulette said was spreading lies about her.

Paulette initially said she didn't know McCarty. But McCarty said she and Paulette connected via Facebook five years ago, before Paulette's diagnosis. McCarty said Paulette insisted on taking her out for a nice birthday dinner, only to have forgotten her credit card. McCarty said she was forced to foot the bill for them both. McCarty said Paulette told her a movie was being made about her based on a book she'd written and that R&B artist Fantasia was doing the soundtrack. When Paulette later revealed her breast cancer on Facebook, McCarty didn't buy it.

Paulette later admitted she'd met McCarty once, but she likes to point out that McCarty has a criminal record and can't be trusted. It's true: McCarty has been convicted of theft, forgery and false pretense -- which could certainly make her a questionable source and made me reticent about reaching out to her at all. But McCarty owns her past and doesn't deny making mistakes.

McCarty has been on an obsessive mission to cast Paulette as a fraud. She has gone so far as to say Paulette never even had cancer, that her double mastectomy was elective after she tested positive for the BRCA gene (think Angelina Jolie's preventive surgery). McCarty insisted her fight is less about Paulette and more about honoring those like her father who've battled cancer, and the friends she's lost to the disease. But McCarty, and some of the people who chime in on her posts, can be downright cruel. They have called Paulette names, mocked her appearance, poked fun at her weight.

Whether or not McCarty can be trusted, her claims were enough to force me to hit pause. I needed to know, with certainty, that Paulette actually had cancer.

Mixed in with selfies, Paulette Leaphart often added shots of herself in hospital beds or otherwise struggling. She asked for prayers and got them by the hundreds.

15 pages of medical records

Paulette, at first, welcomed the chance to clear this up. With me on the line, she called one of her doctors and requested that her medical records be faxed to her. What she didn't tell the receptionist was that she was giving them my fax number. And that's how I learned that Paulette did, in fact, have a 0.7 cm cancerous tumor in her right breast, and that one of six sentinel lymph nodes removed from her right side also tested positive for cancer.

Sometimes, though, when Paulette shares her story, she talks about cancer in her left breast. The left breast was benign, the pathology report shows. She also has talked about her cancer metastasizing to other organs in her body. To be clear, this could have happened; we don't have all of Paulette's medical records, just those that were faxed to me.

Still, I was confused. I asked Paulette for permission to talk to her doctor so I could get a better understanding of her disease and treatment. Whenever I asked for details about radiation, chemotherapy and medications, the information she shared was often vague. She said she requested that her oncologist talk to me, but when I called his office I was told she'd made no such request and the doctor couldn't speak. When I told her this, she never followed up.

So instead I enlisted a surgeon who specializes in breast surgical oncology to interpret the 15 pages of medical records I had.

What I do know, based on the records I've seen, is that Paulette had breast cancer in her right breast. Claims that she did not have cancer are lies.

Paulette's 0.7 cm tumor is considered ""very, very small,"" according to the surgeon, who did not want to be named. A ""re-excision,"" after an initial lumpectomy, could have gotten the slight margin of cancer cells left behind, the surgeon said. Instead, Paulette opted for a double mastectomy.

Paulette said she has a family history of cancer, so such an aggressive approach can be understood, the surgeon said. Because one of the six lymph nodes removed tested positive, she had what doctors describe as stage 2a cancer. Based on what the surgeon saw, she couldn't say whether chemotherapy or radiation would have been necessary.

It should also be noted there is no definitive course of treatment for breast cancer. It's a deeply personal decision a woman makes with her doctor.

Perhaps Paulette had radiation and chemotherapy, as she told me and said on Facebook. But the records I received did not confirm this, and without talking to her oncologist -- something I needed her help to do -- I can't say with certainty that she did. And I certainly can't say I've seen all her medical records.

What I do know, based on the records I've seen, is that Paulette had breast cancer in her right breast. Claims that she did not have cancer are lies.

But exactly how her treatment played out beyond the double mastectomy remains unclear, as do details about how her cancer evolved.

Members of The A Team have pulled together presentations , outlining frequent contradictions in Paulette's story. They have saved every post she's made on Facebook over the past several years and allow her to argue their case for them. Why was she bald before she started chemotherapy? How does she explain recycling identical photos to describe different doctor appointments? What happened to the cancer she once said was in her liver? How could she say pneumonia cleared her lungs of tumors? How did she walk 5 miles each way to doctor's appointments when she claimed to be so sick?

Katrina Adams is another member of The A Team. Her sympathy initially went out to Paulette. She followed her on Facebook and told her she was praying for her. But then she started seeing posts that left her baffled. One day Paulette would be languishing in a hospital bed, and the next she'd be out shopping with her children. Then Adams' own mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer, and Adams saw how chemo ravaged her body. How could Paulette be so active? She started watching more closely, found McCarty along the way and realized she wasn't alone in having doubts.

""I let it go for a while,"" Adams said. ""But then this walk came along and it sent me over the edge.""

Using a Facebook pseudonym, ""Marwin Jones,"" Adams also chronicled Paulette's posts and shared her outrage.

""How can you have heart & liver surgery, pneumonia, train to walk from MS to D.C., home school your children and move six times, all while battling stage 2 aggressive breast cancer that 'in your words' Spread to your liver and lungs. Not to mention, you took 'breaks' from the cancer treatment to travel for leisure,"" she posted in July. ""Who does that? This alone is enough to look at you with the 'side eye.' ""

Paulette Leaphart has been treated as a hero by many. She imagined having a reality TV show and movie deal by the end of her walk.

From help to hesitation

Beyond The A Team, there were others who initially supported Paulette and now have nothing to do with her. Among them were a seasoned public relations professional, a Washington insider with connections to a breast cancer foundation, and a best-selling erotic-fiction author and publisher known as Zane.

An old trusted friend encouraged Zane to sit down with Paulette. Zane was happy to meet her and offer help, but it didn't take long for Zane to grow suspicious. As she described it, she saw the story change in the course of a day: One minute Paulette complained about how much she was paying for cancer medications, but when Zane proposed a way to get medications donated, Paulette said she was on disability and everything was covered, Zane said. When Paulette told her she owed doctors $200,000, someone Zane knew offered Paulette that money on the condition it go directly to the doctors. Paulette passed on the offer, Zane said, saying she'd prefer to declare bankruptcy after the walk.

Another friend of Zane's, with Marriott connections, reached out to Paulette to offer booklets of hotel vouchers so she could stay in rooms free during her walk. Paulette never responded.

Despite all this, Zane said, she has no animosity for Paulette.

""It was just one of those things that once I became apprehensive I didn't want to be involved,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, I wish her well. I just couldn't be caught up in it.""

She made valid points a blind man could see. Carmen Lawrence, after reading Facebook posts critical of Paulette

One woman who did get caught up in it was Carmen Lawrence from Cleveland, who said she had been Facebook friends with Paulette for a few years.

She'd followed her battle with cancer, pneumonia and other ailments. And when Paulette embarked on this ambitious walk, Lawrence wanted to help.

Lawrence told me she took up a collection at work for Paulette. Although Paulette has a GoFundMe page for donations, which has raised $8,640 toward a goal of $100,000, she suggested Lawrence wire her money directly. Lawrence did. She sent Paulette ""well over $800,"" she said.

But Lawrence grew wary. She didn't understand why Paulette was posting only parts of her walk. And when Paulette posted about being stalked by McCarty, Lawrence couldn't help but peek at McCarty's page.

""She made valid points a blind man could see,"" Lawrence said.

She reached out to Paulette to ask questions. How did she know McCarty? Why wasn't her walk recorded? Did she have cancer?

""I was blocked in minutes"" from her Facebook page, Lawrence said. In that moment, any trust she had in Paulette was lost.

""I was so into her story,"" Lawrence said. ""She hung herself.""

Paulette Leaphart was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 2014 but was unable to have reconstructive surgery because of a blood-clotting disorder.

Family matters

Part of Paulette's story centers on when her cancer struck -- seven months after a first cousin, Monique McDonald, died of breast cancer.

Paulette often said she moved to Mississippi in 2013 to care for Monique and her four daughters. I heard Paulette tell a crowd she was the only one who could set her cousin free; that Monique needed Paulette to tell her it was safe to let go and be with God, and only then did she peacefully pass.

But Monique's mother and oldest child aren't having it.

As a little girl, Ashia McDonald, 22, was mesmerized by Paulette. She was the relative who got out of Biloxi, lived a glamorous life and seemed to have it all.

When her mom got really sick, she said, Paulette began calling every day, promising she'd send money and come help. She showed up the day Monique died, Ashia said, and told relatives she'd been evicted from her home. Rather than arrive to help, Ashia said, Paulette was the one who needed help.

Court documents confirm that Paulette failed to pay rent on a Lithia, Florida, home in May 2013. Her landlord threatened legal action in mid-May before filing for an eviction. Monique died on June 1.

The family later learned Paulette had gone to area churches asking for donations for Monique's children, saying she was caring for them, Ashia said. Other than the $50 dorm fee Paulette offered when Ashia went to college that fall, she said she and her sisters -- who were in the custody of their grandmother, Brenda McDonald -- never saw this financial help.

""It tears me up because that's my sister's child,"" said McDonald, 59. She quit her job to care for her grandchildren, and she cries over the phone when she talks about Paulette.

""She took advantage of my grandkids. She took from them. She took their mother's death and ran with it.""

Ashia thinks back to her mother's packed funeral and remembers being struck by Paulette's demeanor. As mourners grieved and comforted one another, Ashia noticed something else in Paulette.

""She was so intrigued. ... There was no sympathy. There was no sadness. It was weird, like she wanted to be in my mother's shoes,"" Ashia said. ""It had everything to do with the crowd and the love. ... I'm telling you, I knew she had something up her sleeve.""

Seven months after the funeral, Paulette was diagnosed with breast cancer.

Sometimes my mom gives so much she gets hurt. Her intentions are always pure. Porsha Cummings, Paulette's oldest child

Another of Paulette's cousins, Candy McDonald, 29, told me of her own anger with Paulette. She, too, always looked up to her ""Auntie Paulette."" But that ended after Candy said she signed a lease for Paulette, which she then skipped out on, hurting Candy's credit, she said. Candy also says Paulette stole her beloved Yorkie named Suge.

Paulette has had three marriages. The first lasted 16 years; the second, four years; the third fell apart in about a week, according to the three men.

Her first husband, David McKenzie, said Paulette was a stay-at-home mom who often provided day care out of their home, and he -- a military man -- was frequently away. He read a few articles about Paulette's journey and worried about her walking along highways with a child but applauded her effort to raise awareness about cancer.

He can't help but laugh a little, though, when he thinks about her setting out to trek 1,000 miles.

""I will say that it's out of her character to walk that far,"" he said.

The Paulette he knew didn't exercise and ""might walk down the street or around the block,"" he said. ""But life changes, seasons change and people change.""

The second man she married, Craig Leaphart, was hesitant to talk.

""I would say that her heart is in the right place and leave it at that,"" he said.

He did add that she's had ""serious health issues"" and that ""her mom had breast cancer.""

I asked how he felt about his daughter walking with Paulette.

""I have no comment on that,"" he said, before hanging up.

Her third husband, Sidney Williams, told me he'd met Paulette on an online dating site right before her double mastectomy. She told him about her cancer, and he fell for her. Months after the double mastectomy, she moved in with him in Seattle, he said. When she told him she had to go to MD Anderson in Houston for cancer treatment, he suggested she stay in Seattle, and he took her to a cancer center there to discuss treatment. He walked into the room just as a doctor was telling her there was no sign of cancer, he said.

""She herded me out of the office at that point,"" he said.

Williams interpreted this to mean she'd never had cancer and said, in that moment, he felt like he'd been ""suckered."" He said he couldn't believe a word she said anymore and told her the marriage was over. He was heartbroken and disappointed but relieved to get out early.

She told me she left him after overhearing him say, while she was in the throes of her cancer battle, ""I didn't marry her to watch her die.""

Williams said she stole his 2003 Jaguar and left the state. She told me she took his car, saying she drove it cross-country in spite of how sick she was. Williams said he never saw that car again.

Paulette Leaphart carried no sign and insisted the scars across her chest told her story. She walked along busy roads, like US 29, saying this was how she could be best noticed.

A daughter's defense

Porsha Cummings takes the criticism of Paulette personally. Cummings, 31, is Paulette's oldest child. The Fort Worth, Texas, hairstylist and mother of three girls talks about a mom who has always given to and thought of others.

""Sometimes my mom gives so much she gets hurt,"" Cummings said. ""Her intentions are always pure.""

A daughter from a relationship before Paulette's first marriage, Cummings said she grew up a ""military brat"" in a family that always lived a ""very affluent lifestyle."" Her mother welcomed girls who'd aged out of the foster system. She ran a day care center out of their home and cut deals for parents who couldn't afford the care. She took in foster children and paid for their private-school educations.

So when Paulette called Cummings and told her she had cancer and was struggling financially, Cummings wanted to take care of her mother. She said she told her mom to come to Texas so she and her fiancé could help. But Paulette wouldn't have it.

""She wanted to put on a strong face for her children,"" Cummings remembered, and didn't want to burden anyone.

Paulette didn't have insurance, Cummings said, and told her she had depleted her savings paying for chemo and other procedures, including $40,000 to remove her breasts. Cummings had been saving up for her wedding and insisted her mother take what she had.

It crushed Cummings to think of her mom sleeping on an air mattress, facing outrageous medical bills and not having all she'd been accustomed to. And then to see people say she was never sick with cancer? That just incensed Paulette's daughter.

""We know her story. We were there,"" Cummings said. ""We're just happy she's surviving and that she's thriving in her survival. ... I'm proud to be her daughter.""

The trailer for a proposed documentary about Paulette Leaphart, which was later scrapped, showed her walking through her New Orleans neighborhood.

Back with questions

The next time I saw Paulette after I left her in Charlotte was in Washington. She had indeed reached the capital by June 27, her 50th birthday, crossing a bridge into the district on foot. A rally to welcome her was scheduled for a week later, after Congress was back in session.

She was surprised to see me. Because I hadn't written about her yet, she said, ""I thought you kicked me to the curb."" Her words reminded me of the cold description she offered about the documentary filmmakers, who she said left her and her daughter ""like dogs on the side of the road.""

I'd come back to Paulette because I still had questions.

Outside a church, a crowd of maybe 50 people gathered. Certainly not the thousands she'd told me earlier would join her on her walk through D.C. Together, they would head to the Capitol for a rally. There were women who wept when they saw Paulette, some who'd driven hours to be by her side. They marveled at her, calling her the strongest woman alive.

Local reporters popped by to meet her. They filmed and gushed. I watched a cameraman turn teary-eyed while she spoke.

Several women took off their shirts to reveal their own scars, something they'd never done before. I walked with one woman, her chest discolored by radiation burns, who almost didn't make it here because of ongoing pain. Women thanked Paulette and cried in her arms. She'd inspired them. She understood them and was like them. She was their hero.

We walked 5 miles that day. I weighed in with those walking and -- once again -- began to fear I was being too hard on Paulette. So what if she hadn't literally walked all 1,000 miles? She was still making a difference. Who was I to question this power she had? Clearly, she'd touched people who needed her.

But then, as she'd done before, Paulette got in her own way.

She has a knack for saying more than she should. If she walked and spoke of cancer, women's health, her faith, it would be sufficient. But she's prone to hyperbole that gets her in trouble.

They did the same thing to Jesus. They're going to have to kill me to stop me. Paulette Leaphart

Apropos of nothing we were discussing, she blurted out that ""Harry called"" and appeared shocked when I didn't immediately know who she was talking about.

""You don't know Harry?"" she said, eyebrows raised. It was Harry Connick Jr., I learned, and she said he wanted her on the premiere of his new show. When I followed up, a spokeswoman for the show told me a producer had been in touch with Paulette about her story but that she did not appear on the premiere, and was not scheduled to appear on any shows.

I asked if Beyoncé ever showed up, and Paulette responded, ""No, she's really busy."" And then she added with a coy smile, ""We're going to catch up later.""

I asked her about her work as a social worker, and she told me she single-handedly reformed the foster care system in the state of Virginia. When I said I'd love to learn more about the program she developed, she told me to Google it. I asked if the program had a name and she couldn't give me one. I tried to confirm Paulette's story by calling the director of social services in the city where Paulette said she worked; despite leaving a dozen messages, I never heard back. The director's assistant said she'd never heard of Paulette, despite starting there long before Paulette claims to have revolutionized the system.

I wanted to know about Paulette's finances when cancer struck. She said she'd been bringing in less than $5,000 a month between child support and half of an ex-husband's retirement money.

In one breath, Paulette would say she made too much to qualify for Medicaid; in another she'd talk about being homeless.

I asked where she was when she lost everything, and she described giving up a house in Mississippi, as well as all her jewelry and her cars.

""Cars?"" I asked. She said she had three of them: two Mercedes and a Cadillac Escalade.

I asked Paulette what she was raising the money for. Was it for a cause? Was it to help fund research to find a cure? She told me the money was only to cover her expenses.

On Facebook she shared photos of people passing her money, including one in which a driver leaned across his passenger seat, waving a $100 bill.

Her critics wondered if she's reporting any of the donations she's received -- whether online, by wire or in person -- and suggested people file complaints with the IRS.

Paulette's supporters told me these critics were just ""trying to snuff out her light,"" as one put it. Paulette insists on Facebook that she loves her haters. She thinks about their efforts to tear her down and also says this: ""They did the same thing to Jesus. They're going to have to kill me to stop me.""

In some cities along the way, Paulette Leaphart was joined by others for community walks. This group in Charlotte sang hymns and chanted ""We need a cure"" and ""Breast cancer sucks.""

Addressing the crowd

She took the stage at a park near the Capitol like a rock star. ""Survivor"" by Destiny's Child blared through speakers, and she implored people to dance.

A couple of women who'd driven in from eastern Pennsylvania sat on the sidelines, watching her in awe. ""She radiates,"" said one. ""I actually got to walk next to her!"" gushed the other.

Paulette spoke about God sending her directly to a surgeon to remove her breasts. Some women answered with amens; others appeared troubled.

""I'm pretty sure you have to go to an oncologist before you go to the surgeon,"" a woman who'd lost one of her own breasts to cancer said to me later. This woman is a devout Catholic and doesn't doubt the power of God, but she said this part of Paulette's story sounded a little off to her.

All day I'd scanned the crowd looking for Shameka Fulston. She was the woman who'd driven through the night from Atlanta to walk with Paulette in Charlotte and had bared her own scarred and breastless chest. She said back then she would walk the last 100 miles of Paulette's journey with her and join her in Washington, but she was nowhere to be seen.

I'm sort of sad this walk is over. If I kept walking, I could have a new house by the end of the year! Paulette Leaphart to a crowd of supporters outside the US Capitol

I later called Fulston to see what became of her. She said several things about Paulette gave her pause in Charlotte. For one, she said Paulette grew annoyed, even angry, when she found out Fulston could have gotten reconstructive surgery but chose not to. Paulette told me she had picked out size D breast implants before doctors said reconstructive surgery was too dangerous.

Fulston didn't want reconstructive surgery because her body had already been through enough, she said. Now, the person who preached that women should embrace their scars was making Fulston feel judged for hers. Then, Fulston said, when she asked what Paulette planned to petition Congress about, Paulette had no clear answer.

""I just don't like being a part of something that doesn't seem to have a lot of direction,"" Fulston said.

Later, she was asked to fly up to Washington for a photo op with Paulette, Fulston said, and she balked. To travel for pictures seemed absurd and a waste of her time. She remains confused about what Paulette is fighting for.

From a stage in the park outside the Capitol, Paulette looked out at her admirers. She said none of this walking was for the money. But then she boasted about the time she raised $1,200 in one day.

""I'm sort of sad this walk is over,"" she told the crowd. ""If I kept walking, I could have a new house by the end of the year!""

Filmmakers spent seven months preparing to film Paulette Leaphart's walk, but they walked away after only a few days. Paulette says she was abandoned; the filmmakers tell a different story.

Blocked on Facebook

After the walk Paulette went back to New Orleans and posted pictures of herself sitting on plush leather seats behind the steering wheel of what appeared to be a new Mercedes SUV.

Paulette later told me she'd be addressing a crowd of 40,000 people over Labor Day weekend. She gave me the name of the event -- I asked her to repeat it so I knew I had it right -- but I couldn't find any evidence of it ever existing. And on Labor Day weekend, this woman who consistently posted on Facebook multiple times a day said nothing about a speaking engagement.

Paulette continued to say she wasn't out for fame and attention but kept sharing glamor shots and pictures from TV and film sets. She posted about her daughter now having an agent but did not respond when I texted to congratulate her and asked to learn more.

She has since blocked me from her personal Facebook account.

It's what she does when people ask questions, I've been told time and again. One woman, after noticing Paulette's posts about her newfound fame and attention, simply asked her how she was paying it forward. She, too, got blocked.

In November, Paulette posted a video in which she talked about a CNN reporter who had been on ""a witch hunt"" for six months. She'd been warned that I was working on a story -- ""a negative article,"" she said -- and shared what she felt after seeing me in Washington.

""Her eyes were dark,"" she told her followers. ""And I felt this spirit about her and it was very uncomfortable. ... My manager noticed something about her, too.""

(Her claims are) unfair to those women who truly endured those treatments to survive breast cancer. The exploitation ... has got to stop. Dr. Melanye Maclin, a Maryland dermatologist

Not always beautiful

Last fall, someone put me in touch with Dr. Melanye Maclin , a Maryland dermatologist who does research and has developed hair and skin care product lines.

She has media and celebrity connections in the Washington area and says she was asked to help get Paulette publicity when she arrived in the nation's capital at the end of her walk. Maclin had been watching Paulette's journey and was intrigued, so it was easy enough for her to make a couple of quick calls.

She invited Paulette to her home for lunch, where they discussed a campaign Maclin wanted to launch for her skincare line. It was to be called ""Always Beautiful"" and would be about capturing a person's inner beauty. Paulette seemed the ""living example"" of the message, and ""Dr. Mac,"" as she's often called, imagined Paulette being the face of the campaign.

A couple of friends, including a breast cancer surgeon, saw Maclin's enthusiasm about Paulette and told her to be cautious. But she, like so many others, wanted to believe. So did her friend Chantay Savage, a recording artist whose remake of Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"" went gold. Savage's mother died of breast cancer, and she recorded a song, ""Always Beautiful,"" for Dr. Mac. The song was released on social media and featured Paulette in the video.

The flood of negative remarks and accusations about Paulette was almost immediate. They took the doctor and Savage by surprise, and they yanked the video. They also began to look at what Paulette's critics were posting. In an email, Maclin reflected more on what she'd seen on Paulette's Facebook page and heard from Paulette directly.

""She does not display hyperpigmentation from radiation or scars claimed from the multiple surgeries due to admitted liver and lung metastasis,"" Maclin wrote.

The breast surgeon I'd enlisted to look at the limited medical records I had about Paulette agreed that the photos show no obvious sign of radiation or additional surgeries, but also reserved judgment, saying some people are less likely to scar.

But there was more from Maclin, who added, ""It was also bizarre that she told me that she did not do chemotherapy,"" contradicting the story she has told on social media.

Her claims are ""unfair to those women who truly endured those treatments to survive breast cancer,"" Maclin said. ""The exploitation ... has got to stop.""

Paulette Leaphart's walk stirred up a media frenzy. Her image and story appeared in print, online and across screens around the globe.

The media and the message

One leader in breast cancer activism, who didn't want to be named, encouraged me to think about Paulette in a different way. Yes, she may be prone to exaggeration and not entirely believable, but if she touches one person, if she inspires one woman to get a mammogram, isn't that a win? And, this activist added, Paulette largely speaks to a population that deserves attention.

Black women are less likely to receive breast cancer diagnoses at an early stage than are white women, are more likely to receive a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer (which means cancer cells don't have the receptors to respond to certain drugs and therapies) and have the lowest breast cancer survival rate of any ethnic or racial group, according to the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

The difference in mortality rates can be attributed to the stage of diagnosis, tumor characteristics and issues such as obesity. But it is also influenced by levels of education and access to treatment and health insurance, a comprehensive American Cancer Society report says.

Furthermore, Paulette has tapped into an audience that shares her faith.

If women are taking notice and paying more attention to their breasts because of her, that may be all that matters. The message may be more important than the messenger.

There's no way to measure how much of a difference Paulette Leaphart made in shaping the conversation about cancer in this country.

But then another activist, who also didn't want to be named, described Paulette as dangerous. This activist works with women with stage 4 metastatic cancer, women whose cancer has spread to other organs, usually the bones, brain, liver or lungs. Their survival rate is the lowest, and these women, this activist said, are facing the end.

For a while, she followed Paulette's journey. Then, she said, she saw a Facebook post about a woman with stage 4 who Paulette said successfully prayed away her cancer.

""That was it for me,"" said the activist, who then unfriended Paulette. ""Does that mean my friends weren't worthy of being saved?""

Others voiced concerns about her preying on people's emotions and their wallets while standing on a pedestal for a cause that seemed undefined.

I wondered if other journalists had faced doubts and hurdles; I wanted to hear their experiences covering Paulette.

One newspaper reporter, on condition of anonymity, admitted to having had some misgivings but was on a tight deadline and being pushed to publish. Another piece was put out by someone who, it turned out, wasn't a journalist and didn't have the tools or obligation to check Paulette's story. What mattered most in this case, I was told, was giving voice to the struggles she represented.

Other journalists I contacted didn't want to comment at all.

Upworthy, a website for viral content, reached out to Emily MacKenzie, the documentary filmmaker, to see if she could vouch for Paulette's story. MacKenzie said she told them that, in good conscience, she could not and advised the site against sharing any videos of Paulette. The site did anyway, and one video it posted in June got more than 20 million views, which only prompted other outlets to tell Paulette's story.

I reached out to people at Upworthy, including the vice president who MacKenzie said she spoke to, more than half a dozen times. I said I wanted to learn about their vetting process and the decision to share videos about Paulette. I never got a response.

Paulette Leaphart appeared on TV and film sets after her walk ended and posted selfies with Will Smith and Scott Bakula.

Hollywood sets and setbacks

Before she blocked me from seeing her Facebook page, I checked on her social media presence from time to time. The images were often a mixture of selfies and pictures of her posing, impeccably made up and modeling new clothes. She appeared on the sets of CBS' ""NCIS: New Orleans"" and the upcoming movie ""Girls Trip,"" posting pictures with stars and mentioning names like Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith. She shared a shot with Scott Bakula on the ""NCIS"" set, and another with Will Smith, who was visiting the ""Girls Trip"" set. ""Will Smith heard about my story and came over to shake my hand,"" she wrote.

Other photos showed her home in bed, giving two thumbs up from a gurney in an ambulance and in a hospital room bed. She pleaded for prayers and talked about pain and setbacks. At one point she feared she had kidney cancer and asked people to pray for her. It turned out to be a kidney stone. She worried a lump under her arm was the return of breast cancer, and supporters overwhelmed her with more prayers. It was a cyst.

One day she'd be listless under the covers; another she'd be dolled up in clothes she said were created specifically for her. She'd stand beside people she'd identify as her personal stylist, her fashion consultant, her makeup artist.

We need this story. We need this woman before us. We need this woman and what she did on the tip of our tongues. Nikky Finney, poet and author

At one point over the summer, she encouraged people to sign a petition for a proposed ""cancer relief bill"" written by a Michigan resident. But that push seemed sporadic.

Since then, I've used other Facebook accounts to keep tabs on her posts.

She's been the keynote speaker at a few events. She walked into turquoise waters while on a Caribbean cruise. She drove to Florida to receive, by her own account, $27,000 of dental work free of charge. In early October, she attended the espnW Women + Sports Summit in California. She was flown first class, put up in a posh resort and walked away with $400 in Adidas swag. She was also flown to ESPN's headquarters in December, where she was given the espnW Pegasus Award for Inspiration.

An esteemed poet and author, Nikky Finney, took to the stage at the summit in California to share ""Topless in America,"" an original and powerful piece she wrote in Paulette's honor.

I reached out to Finney to see if she was aware of the questions swirling around Paulette's story. She didn't respond.

On her website , Finney calls Paulette her ""shero."" She says she ""stopped me in my tracks and reminded me of what a woman is truly made of: Iron & Lavender.""

""We need this story. We need this woman before us,"" Finney writes. ""We need this woman and what she did on the tip of our tongues.""

As the heat rolled in late last spring, Paulette Leaphart began to slow down. She said she hoped to walk 20 miles a day, rather than the up to 40 miles a day that she said she'd walked previously.

The 'real Paulette'?

What Paulette did should be on the tips of our tongues, but not because she deserves praise, others say.

Annette Johnson of Beaumont, Texas, has known Paulette for several decades. She knows some of Paulette's relatives and attended the same church when they were both living in Mississippi.

Paulette reached out to Johnson in October 2013, months after Johnson was diagnosed with breast cancer and Paulette's cousin, Monique McDonald, had died. This was a few months before Paulette's own diagnosis. Johnson said Paulette wanted to hear all about what she was going through.

""Then, all of a sudden, she came down with cancer,"" Johnson said. ""And I was really sympathetic.""

But as time went on, Johnson began to notice something strange. She said Paulette's Facebook posts began to mirror a little too closely the experiences Johnson had shared in phone conversations with Paulette.

Johnson rattled off her dietary and workout regimens, only to see Paulette post them as if they were her own. She told Paulette she lost her hair after the first chemo treatment, and all of a sudden, she said, Paulette had shaved her head. She mentioned how she wasn't able to get a chemo treatment when her white blood cell count was too high. The same thing happened to Paulette. Johnson told her that during a workup, doctors found a spot on her liver. Paulette's doctors found one, too. Johnson made an unusual request of her doctors: that she be allowed to keep her chemo port when it was taken out; it had been her ""lifeline,"" she said. The next thing she knew, Paulette was boasting about keeping hers.

""Can you not have an original thought of your own?"" Johnson said she thought.

To have your story pimped, played and punked by someone for their own selfish gain is a sin and a shame. Annette Johnson, a longtime acquaintance of Paulette

And then there was this: She told Paulette she was marrying her long-lost love. Soon after, Johnson said, Paulette told her she was marrying her long-lost love, too. But Sidney Williams, Paulette's third husband and the supposed long-lost love, said the two had met online only months before.

There were other things about Paulette's story that raised questions. When Johnson was in the throes of treatment, she felt good about herself if she could walk to the kitchen and back to bed. Yet here was Paulette driving cross-country in Williams' car.

""You drove yourself back in the midst of treatment? I didn't drive for a year,"" Johnson remembered saying. ""How did you do that?""

""I just did it,"" she recalled Paulette answering.

Paulette took pictures of herself in emergency waiting rooms just about every week, Johnson said.

Other Facebook posts showed Paulette bouncing around, going on vacations, just as she was claiming to be broke and deathly ill. And she was taking repeated breaks from her treatment, which made no sense to Johnson.

Johnson could no longer believe her. She'd opened up, shared her pain, thought she was confiding in and bolstering a fellow survivor. She felt like she'd been had, and was angry because she'd defended Paulette to others.

""We share our stories to encourage another sister or brother who is going through the process. We open up and give our hearts,"" she said. ""To have your story pimped, played and punked by someone for their own selfish gain is a sin and a shame.""

What Paulette has done ""hurts me to the core,"" Johnson said. She said she wants the ""real Paulette"" to stand up. ""I encourage her to tell her own story.""

Last July, after arriving in Washington, Paulette Leaphart set out to lobby Congress. Her message, however, wasn't entirely clear.

The devil on her back

I reached out to a psychologist after reading her blog post about the ""psychology of hero worship."" She told me everyone has access to 15 minutes -- and more -- of fame these days. To stand out, though, people have to ""up the ante and up the storytelling.""

In the case of Paulette, I can't help but believe she upped that ante to her own detriment.

On December 13, then-President Barack Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, a $6.3 billion bill that includes $4.8 billion for medical research for cancer and other diseases.

Paulette took to Facebook Live to talk about the good news. She said her phone had been ""blowing up"" with messages.

""I'm trying not to cry,"" she said. ""But God said that there was going to be a cure, and he asked me to take that walk to talk to Congress and get their attention.""

I was there for the first two of her meetings on the Hill, along with an entourage of her children, some of her friends and fans, and a woman who says she is Paulette's manager. Paulette met with aides in both cases, though Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan came in at the very end of her meeting in his office and posed with her and others for pictures. She later posted Facebook pictures with Rep. Donald M. Payne Jr., D-New Jersey, and Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican.

Perhaps she grew more effective as her visits continued. But in the meetings I attended, Paulette didn't seem to understand that the people she was meeting with were on her side -- that they, too, want a cure for cancer and more affordable health care. Nor did she get how the legislative system works or which laws -- including the Affordable Care Act -- were already in place.

She complained about insurance and pharmaceutical companies, talked about being a business owner for 20 years who then became homeless. She said she made $1 too much to qualify for food stamps. She said she had to pay $5,000 a month for her blood disorder treatments. I could only surmise that this was in addition to the $2,500 to $5,000 a month she often said she needed to pay for her cancer treatments.

""You're preaching to the choir,"" an aide said. ""This congressman shares your concerns.""

He explained to her how the system works, how there needs to be a certain number of votes to pass bills, how she needs to lobby in her own district to effect change.

Paulette listened and demanded: ""What's more important than human life?""

This story wasn't just about Paulette. It's about our need to find -- and, for some of us, become -- heroes.

There's no way to measure how much of a difference Paulette Leaphart made in shaping the conversation about cancer in this country. She touched many minds and hearts, but whether she did so in the most honest and transparent way remains questionable.

The day after Christmas, she posted a new photo from a hospital bed. She complained of excruciating pain and revealed there was a new mass, this time next to her right ovary. My stomach dropped for her. She asked for prayers, and they came in by the hundreds.

Then, in less than 24 hours, her longtime critic Kimberly McCarty shared an old post that questioned whether Paulette still had her ovaries. In the post, one of Paulette's daughters wrote that her mother's ovaries were being removed out of fear that the hormones produced by them were feeding her breast cancer. And, once again, I no longer knew what to believe or feel.

Then came Facebook photos from Paulette. In one she was getting a vaginal ultrasound. In another, she was flashing the victory sign with her fingers and smiling as she was being pushed into an MRI machine. She posed next to the doctor who, she said, had just removed her ovaries. There was no cancer, she later reported.

In the weeks before publishing this story, I set out to give Paulette a chance to address questions I still had and to respond to accusations made by others. I emailed her twice detailing my reporting and asking for answers about everything from her career and court judgments to her cancer and treatment. When I got no reply, I texted her and even had my editor send her a Facebook message. Then I called her. She indicated she had seen my questions and told me she didn't want to talk to me.

Soon after my first email, Paulette thanked Jesus on Facebook for her ""brand spanking new house"" and shared a photograph of the home.

""I obeyed him,"" she said of God, ""even when the devil was riding my back.""

Days before we published this story, Paulette took to Facebook Live and said that about 25 years ago, after multiple suicide attempts and a nervous breakdown, she was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, formerly called multiple personality disorder. She said 10 years of therapy helped her integrate more than 20 personalities. She said she was going public with this after reading about the movie ""Split,"" by M. Night Shyamalan . Once more, I felt for her -- and wished I could know what to believe.

Paulette likes to say that when life gave her lemons, she made lemonade. She adopted yellow as the color of her campaign and often says ""yellow is the new pink."" She once mused out loud as we walked in North Carolina whether the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the embodiment of all things pink and cancer, would put out a hit on her for stealing attention from its organization.

I don't think I'll ever know the full truth about Paulette. But the color that comes to mind when I think of her is neither yellow nor pink. It's the murkiest of grays.",2017-03-31 00:00:00
'Little Buddha' wisdom from a terminally ill 'goofball',"Venice Beach, California (CNN) As a small child, she played hide-and-seek with nurses, ripped out IVs to race around the hospital floor naked and left an explosion of glitter in her wake.

As a teen, she got boys to carry her uphill when she was tired, taught her best friend how to flirt and watched her doctor squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk.

And as an adult, Claire Wineland has continued living out loud, even as her body fails her.

Claire, 20, has cystic fibrosis, a genetic and terminal progressive disease that's landed her in the hospital for a quarter of her life. Ask what's on her bucket list, and she'll say she doesn't have one.

Fixating on a checklist of goals before she goes ""sounds exhausting,"" she says, especially ""when you've been dying your whole life."" Instead, she'd rather focus on doing all she can in each moment.

It's a sort of wisdom that makes some describe this California free spirit as ""an old soul"" or ""a little Buddha.""

I meet Claire in a Venice Beach café; everyone who works there seems to know her. She's on a mission to normalize sickness, push back at those who pity her and have a meaningful life for however long it lasts. Although she certainly has her down days -- ""Who doesn't?"" she notes -- this self-described ""goofball"" tackles life with humor and the sort of charisma that draws people to her.

Claire Wineland smiles broadly at a comedy roast to raise money for Claire's Place Foundation in July 2015.

Still, she says, she must train people to feel comfortable around her.

""I can't just expect people to know what to say,"" she says, ""I have to make them see me as more than my illness.""

She's been working at it on a number of fronts: In high school, she created a series of videos that went viral and penned pieces for national audiences, including one for CNN . She's appeared in magazines, on television shows and at teen award ceremonies. She's heading up a foundation, writing a book -- she promises it's not ""another happy sick person book"" -- and packing in as much as her 5-foot-2, 95-pound frame can handle.

Through it all, she gives public talks. On this day, that's at a TEDx event in Encinitas, a beachside community 100 miles south of her apartment in LA's Venice Beach.

We'd arranged to take the train down for the event. But she'd been fighting a fever as high as 103 the day before, the result of one of many infections her body continuously fights. When I offer to drive instead, she seems relieved. I am, too.

She's chatty and bubbly for most of the two-plus-hour trip, until she feels the fever coming back and curls up in the passenger seat for a nap. The only sound from her now is an occasional cough and the pumping of a portable oxygen concentrator, which gives her the air she needs without the burden of a tank. When I glance over, I spot a tattoo on her left ankle: the ""thumbs up"" logo from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" with the phrase ""DON'T PANIC.""

But I start to do so when she wakes up and says her lungs feel ""funny."" At the venue, she makes her way to the ""green room,"" where she sits, eyes closed, willing stomach pains to subside, trying to pull it together. She's set to go on in 20 minutes, and I'm afraid she won't make it.

More than a sick kid

She's been riveting audiences since she was 14, when she first stepped on a stage in a new ruffled dress. When I picked her up at her apartment, she wore faded black jeans and a black T-shirt that read ""Sexual Intellectual.""

""Life is too short to not be yourself,"" she said.

Ever since she was little, she found it strange how people treated her. They'd peer down with sad eyes and say, ""I'm so sorry."" It was a statement she heard so often, it was hard not to internalize. And in a society consumed with being healthy, she grew confused.

""What happens when you have an illness where you're never going to be healthy?"" she asked. ""Does that mean I'm never going to have a life? Am I never going to do anything or be anything other than a sick kid?""

Claire is one of 70,000 people worldwide, 30,000 in the United States alone, who live with cystic fibrosis, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimates. To have the disease, both parents must be carriers of the CF gene. If they are, there's a one in four chance their children will be born with the disease.

Cystic fibrosis leads to an overabundance of mucus, which blocks airways and traps infections in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, with time, causes respiratory failure.

At last count, Claire says, she's had more than 30 surgeries. On a daily basis, she takes about four dozen medications, including self-administered shots for her CF-related diabetes, and might spend up to six hours on breathing treatments.

She dons a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus, and uses a nebulizer to blow in steam and inhale medicines. She can cough up enough mucus each day to measure in cups. She gets admitted to the hospital for regular tuneups and intensive treatments.

All the while, with her lung capacity diminished, her body works harder to breathe.

""It's like I'm jogging 24/7,"" she said. She must consume as many as 5,000 calories a day to maintain her weight -- forget about gaining any.

That explains the two large pastries she ordered for lunch when we met, and the French fries she got to go. And it's why her younger sister, Elanore Nordquist, 13, used to get miffed whenever she wasn't allowed a second piece of cake but Claire could always have as much as she wanted.

Even with this carte blanche for consumption, Claire takes in 2,000 calories through a feeding tube as she sleeps, while a machine helps her breathe so her body can rest.

Pineapples and mushrooms

Claire can laugh at the absurdities in her life. She tells stories of strangers who've approached her with unsolicited prescriptions for cures. The produce section of Whole Foods is ripe for material, she says. One shopper told her she simply needed to eat more pineapple. Another said all she required was a mushroom cleanse.

And then there was the homeless guy outside a gas station who insisted that the mind can change reality and that she didn't need to be sick. She remembered thinking, with a laugh, ""If that's true, why are you homeless?""

But it was a friend who, when Claire was 11, changed her outlook by handing her a book he insisted she see.

Claire has always welcomed chances to escape Los Angeles and breathe cleaner air. Here, she visits Vancouver, British Columbia, several years ago.

It was Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time."" The cosmology book blew her young and curious mind, and she rushed to the library to learn more about its author. Only then did she find out that Hawking had ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and was terminally ill, too.

Until that moment, Claire -- an avid reader -- had yet to find any role models, examples of sick people doing remarkable things.

""His body was completely failing, but he was contributing something incredible to society,"" she said. Hawking's diagnosis did not define him. ""He transcended it.""

In him, she found inspiration, though it would take a steep downturn for her to see her way up.

Flatlining

The sicker a person with cystic fibrosis gets, the more work they need to do to stay relatively well -- and the harder it is to do that work. It's enough to make some ""CFers,"" as Claire calls them, stop trying.

She gets it because she was once there.

""It's not that I wanted to die,"" she said. ""But I didn't know how to live.""

At 12, she feared that she was surviving just to survive.

During a hospital stay, she had become close friends with Vanessa, another girl with cystic fibrosis. CFers aren't supposed to be together, as they carry bacteria that can be deadly if shared. But these two girls connected at a safe distance, doing art projects across the room while wearing protective masks. They made disco balls for the nursing station out of crushed CDs and glue, shared an understanding and a sense of humor and, over the course of a year and a half, a deep friendship. And then, Vanessa died.

Bereft and facing a lifetime of treatments, Claire asked herself, ""Why am I doing this?""

Claire and her sister, Elanore Nordquist, cuddle the night before Claire moves out of the house. One of the things Claire appreciates most about Elanore is that she's never treated Claire like a sick person.

So she began to lie, saying she took her medications and treatments when she didn't. For a year, her health slipped, and she said no one could figure out why. Claire, who'd always peppered her doctors and nurses with questions, knew the language and how to trick everyone.

The day after her 13th birthday, a straightforward surgery to deal with acid reflux spiraled into chaos. She contracted a blood infection that attacked her lungs. She could feel them failing.

As her oxygen levels plummeted, she began hallucinating. In a moment of clarity, she thought, ""I don't want to actually die. I want to see what happens in life. I want to see where it goes.""

She was placed in a medically induced coma, intubated and hooked up to an oscillator, a machine that gently puffed air into her fragile lungs. No child with CF had successfully come off an oscillator, doctors told her parents. Claire says she was given a 1% chance of survival. She flatlined twice.

Her little sister was 6 at the time. Elanore remembers a social worker talking to her before she went in -- ""all sanitized and in a gown"" -- to see Claire.

""They told me to say goodbye,"" Elanore said. ""They told me 'she's probably not going to wake up.' ""

A winter wonderland

There was no white light. Instead, Claire transported herself to a place she'd never been: Alaska.

Her subconscious journey began beneath ice water, she says. When she surfaced, she peered up at a mountain of snow. She sat amid ice-crystal-covered pine trees, floated on ice sheets while looking up at stars and hung out in a woodland house where animals streamed in to visit her.

After her coma, Claire traveled to Sitka, Alaska, the place she believes she subconciously visited.

Claire remained in a coma for more than two weeks. When she woke up, she learned that her dream world had unfolded while she had been submerged in an ice bath to bring down her fever.

Though conscious again, she couldn't walk, sit up or hold silverware. She had to wear diapers. Her mom called her ""Grandpa,"" a memory that still makes her laugh.

""My body had no reserves left,"" she said. ""It was kaput.""

In the many months she worked to get stronger, she found renewed purpose.

""I feel like she had a spiritual experience,"" said her mom, Melissa Nordquist Yeager. ""She came out inspired to help others.""

Finding meaning by giving back

Claire entered the world the way she lives: boldly.

Yeager was overdue to give birth to her firstborn when a routine ultrasound morphed into a scene of terror.

She watched the doctor's face as he studied the screen. He ducked out and returned with another doctor. They told her that something was wrong with the baby and that Yeager had to be induced immediately.

Claire was born with meconium ileus, a bowel obstruction that is a telltale sign of CF. Her bowel had ruptured, leaving her belly protruded, and she was whisked off for the first of many surgeries.

""The prognosis was five years,"" Yeager said, ""and that was a maybe.""

Claire spent the next seven weeks in neonatal intensive care. Her father, John Wineland, recalls peering down at his daughter as she screamed amid the medical equipment and tubes. Their eyes locked.

""It's going to be OK,"" he remembers telling her. ""We're in this together.""

Just like that, Claire's parents, who then lived in Austin, Texas, were jolted from naiveté.

Claire has spent a quarter of her life in the hospital, mostly at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in California, where her medical team is just like family.

Raising a daughter with CF ""has consumed most of my attention, most of my life,"" said Yeager, who now lives in Seal Beach, California. She and Wineland, of Santa Monica, never married and decided to split when Claire was 3, but they remained close friends and have continued to tackle Claire's care together.

With Claire in the hospital two or three months a year, Yeager never felt that she could build a career. She lost a handful of jobs and quit others as hospital stays dictated. She'd take the day shifts with Claire while Wineland took nights. He'd hunker down next to Claire in the hospital, watch movies with her at 3 a.m. when she couldn't sleep, and head to work in the morning.

All the while, Claire's parents -- and, by extension, Claire -- were surrounded by friends. They'd come to the hospital with meals, stick around when her parents couldn't, help rally the family and manage their lives. They also helped make Claire more outgoing and sociable, her dad says.

Claire grew up knowing that she and her parents were fortunate, that too many families lacked the support they had. After waking from her 16-day coma, Claire proposed starting an organization to offer financial and emotional help to others navigating life with CF.

Whether it's covering rents, mortgages, insurance premiums or car payments, Claire's Place Foundation aims to relieve pressure when CFers are hospitalized so families can focus on what matters most. Not long ago, it even helped find an apartment for a homeless CFer who was floating between shelters.

What started as ""a side project to celebrate (Claire's) life and survival became a passion of all of ours,"" said Yeager, who serves as the executive director.

And for Claire, the foundation changed everything.

""All throughout my teenage years, I was able to hold on to the foundation as a means to remind me that I had value,"" she said. ""It's important for people who are sick to feel empowered. It gives them reason to take care of themselves.""

Don't touch her sushi

In high school, Claire launched The Clairity Project , a website offering insight into her life, including videos that became popular on YouTube.

She offered honest talk with a smile about dying, life expectancy, even the perks of being sick. She gave tips on how to interact with sick people, answered questions she's often asked and introduced her family . She and her father, on guitar, performed together, singing Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door.""

She stepped away from making videos after no longer seeing eye-to-eye with a production company that got involved. Instead, she decided to focus on what she could control and feel good about: the foundation and her speaking engagements.

She also embarked on a new phase: Since graduating high school, she's lived on her own with a roommate in Venice Beach.

A 2015 trip to Europe with childhood friend Alicia Schomer, who says Claire has changed her: ""I'm not as terrifed of the thought of death anymore, but I am terrified of not living life to the fullest.""

It can be hard for any parent when a child leaves the nest, but for Claire's mom, the transition has been even more fraught.

Yeager knows how much work goes into Claire's care and worries that her daughter won't ask for help.

""I'm happy for her, and I know she's capable,"" her mother said. ""But I just see how sick she's getting.""

A year ago, Claire was at 50% lung capacity, Yeager says. Today, she's at 30%. She must take antibiotics to beat back recurring infections, which have become resistant to most of the drugs.

And when she turned 18 and could decide for herself, Claire announced that she wasn't interested in being on the list for a double lung transplant.

""I had to be honest,"" she said. ""It's not for me and never has been.""

Though transplants can extend a life, they're no cure. She'd have to live on steroids, which she hates taking. She'd run the risk of developing new issues when she's used to the ones she has. Plus, her body could reject the new lungs.

""And you can't eat sushi afterwards. That's a no,"" quipped Claire, who says she'd spend hundreds of dollars a month on sushi alone, if she could.

Therapies developed in trials are now helping many CFers, according to the She insists that she's not giving up, though. Instead of opting for a transplant, she's holding out hope for a cure. If she got new lungs, she says, she wouldn't qualify for drugs in development.Therapies developed in trials are now helping many CFers, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , and eventually, with other clinical trials now underway, as many as 95% of CFers could benefit.

Her decision was a blow to her parents. They've had to accept that she won't pursue an option that could give her another 10 years.

""Just think of it as insurance, even if you don't want to do it,"" her mom pleaded at first. ""Get on the list so you can change your mind.""

But Yeager, no matter how uncomfortable it makes her, knows to trust her daughter's intuition.

""She has a relationship with her body that is sacred,"" explains her dad, who, like Claire, is a practicing Buddhist. Claire's thinking, he said: ""This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with.""

And as her father, ""I have to live with it.""

Claire, unplugged

Claire is Wineland's only child. He says she's helped him become a better person.

He's learned ""to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet"" and believes that Claire is exactly how she's supposed to be. He's learned to ""love what is.""

At 51, he finds comfort in meditation and yoga, which Claire practiced for years, before her coma.

Wineland is a life and relationship coach. Together, he and Claire have explored ways to grow spiritually. When Claire was 10, he says, she walked on fire at a retreat run by motivational speaker Tony Robbins. He's had to figure out healthy ways to deal with pain, even to see the beauty in it.

""When you don't know what's going to happen to your only child,"" he says, ""it can be pretty debilitating.""

Claire's parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split when Claire was 3 but remain close friends and partners when it comes to her care.

Humor has also helped him cope. When there's a long line at a restaurant, he says, he'll sometimes send her to the front of the line coughing to play ""the sick-kid card.""

Yeager too marvels at what Claire's done for her. She says her daughter's aura and energy lift those around her, making Claire ""a force of nature.""

During a recent hospital stay, mother and daughter were talking about death, a subject they don't shy away from.

""After you die, you're closer to everyone you love, because you're part of everything,"" Yeager remembers Claire saying. The words were a gift, a reminder that her daughter's essence will remain always, even after she's gone.

""If and when it does happen,"" Yeager said, ""I'm never going to forget her saying that.""

Elanore, Claire's only sibling, is more no-nonsense. She never treated Claire differently, a fact Claire has always treasured.

""She couldn't care less that I was sick, which I loved,"" Claire says. ""It was refreshing.""

When she was younger, Elanore cared so little that sometimes she'd even unplug Claire's oxygen without telling anyone.

""We wrestled a lot,"" Claire remembers with a laugh. ""She'd unplug it to make me tired so she could win.""

She gets how sick Claire is today. Still, she doesn't see Claire as a sick person.

""She's just a person,"" Elanore says. ""She's not all-knowing. She's still figuring it out, like a lot of people. ... She needs the freedom to be a 20-year-old.""

'It's OK to feel pain'

Though Claire had been attending Santa Monica College, part of her freedom meant putting school on hold.

""Truth be told, I probably wouldn't make it to graduation,"" she said. ""I feel my body changing, and I had to make an executive decision.""

Instead, she's focusing on what she can accomplish now -- including a new partnership with Zappos for Good to make hospitals more, well, hospitable. She's designing the renovation and decoration of a playroom and intensive care rooms at the Children's Hospital of Nevada at UMC in Las Vegas, which Zappos will pay for. The partnership began after Claire addressed about 2,000 people at the company in November.

Calling her ""super inspiring,"" Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh said, ""I'm pretty sure she brought tears to most of the people in the room.""

What her Zappos audience didn't know that day was how awful Claire felt.

Over the past couple years, she's had more bad days than good. And in Claire's world, that can't stop her. If she bowed out whenever she felt under the weather, she says, she'd never accomplish a thing.

It's like that again today as she sits in the green room in Encinitas, the TEDx audience awaiting her talk.

The venue is a large meeting space behind a vegan restaurant. Attendees sip kombucha on tap and exchange hugs that last extra beats. When someone asks whether there's a yoga instructor in the room, they raise their hands en masse. Outside in the hallway are pieces of self-help literature, an announcement for a festival ""dedicated to the Divine Goddess"" and business cards for a spiritual medium.

When I peek in on Claire, I grow worried. The room is dark, and her eyes are closed, her arms folded across her belly. I fight every protective instinct to whisk her off and take her home.

Instead, she rallies.

As the emcee introduces her, Claire stands tall, showing no sign of pain or discomfort. She strides toward the stage amid applause, her smile wide. If not for the pumping oxygen concentrator slung over her shoulder, strangers might not suspect that anything's wrong.

She jumps in and talks about the fear she had when she first spoke publicly, the guilt she felt whenever she landed in the hospital, the isolation CFers often feel. She also speaks of what inspires her and her understanding that illness shouldn't stop anyone from living proudly.

""It's OK to feel pain and experience it,"" she says. ""I'm not trying to fix myself. My suffering has given me so much.""

For about 18 minutes, she sets out to change how people think.

When she's done, the crowd stands and applauds. Some audience members hoot and holler. As she weaves through the crowd toward the exit, I chase after her, overhearing whispers like, ""What a gem.""

It's clear people would like to talk to her, hug her, corner her for conversation. She shoots me a glance, though, that says, ""Let's get out of here.""

Claire has given all she can, and she knows she'll pay a price.

The price

In the weeks that follow, Claire can't shake that infection. Then, in mid-June, an ambulance rushes her to the ER: Her fever is back at 103, her heart rate is at 185, and her white blood cell count is 30,000. Claire's oxygen saturation levels are falling, a sign of lung failure.

Not since the scare that landed her in a coma six years earlier has the situation felt so dire, her mother says.

For a few days, Claire only gets worse. She's transported to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where the staff feels like family. She has sepsis and a severe case of pneumonia and spends a week in intensive care. Doctors come close to putting her on a ventilator when one of the only two antibiotics that still work for her kick in.

""I thought this was it,"" Yeager says. ""It was an eye-opener for all of us.""

It's too early to know how much of a toll this setback will take on Claire, who is expected to head home from the hospital Wednesday.

""We think of Claire as invincible,"" her mother says, ""and this was a reminder.""

A reminder of how important it is to live each moment fully. A reminder of the lessons Claire still hopes to teach before it's too late.",2017-07-05 00:00:00

Story highlights Conjoined twins Anias and Jadon McDonald were separated more than 16 hours into surgery New: After 27 hours, both twins are out of surgery and in intensive care

(CNN) —

After 27 hours of surgery, twin boys Anias and Jadon McDonald – born joined at the head 13 months ago – began a new life apart on Friday.

The round-the-clock operation at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx began Thursday morning and ended Friday. The separation procedure itself lasted 16 hours, followed by more hours of surgery to rebuild their skulls and make them whole.

Jadon was the first of the boys to be finished. He was wheeled out of the operating room around 7:40 a.m. on a stretcher, his perfectly shaped head wrapped in white gauze.

He was taken on an elevator to the pediatric intensive care unit on the 10th floor, where he was reunited with his parents, Nicole and Christian McDonald.

“My boy,” Christian said with tears in his eyes.

Nicole bent over in tears.

More than five hours later, around 1 p.m., surgeons finished operating on Anias, and he was brought to the 10th floor unit – where the family was finally reunited.

The surgery was led by Dr. James Goodrich, considered the leading expert on what’s known as craniopagus surgery.

It marked the seventh and longest separation surgery performed by Goodrich – and just the 59th craniopagus separation surgery in the world since 1952.

Nicole and Christian had to make an excruciating decision, opting for the procedure even though it carried major risks, including the possibility of death or long-term brain damage for one or both boys. But not to operate also carried risks: 80% of twins joined at the head die of medical complications by age 2 if not separated, studies show.

Goodrich informed the family of the separation around 3 a.m.

“Well, we did it,” Goodrich said.

On her Facebook page, Nicole wrote: “TWO SEPARATE BABIES!!!…and yet I ache with the uncertainty of the future. I didn’t cry until the surgeons left the room. I was barely able to even utter the words ‘thank you’ because of the pit that still sits heavy in my stomach. We are standing on the brink of a vast unknown. The next few months will be critical in terms of recovery and we will not know for sure how Anias and Jadon are recovering for many weeks.”

Dr Goodrich and his team just left. He walked in the room and plopped in the arm chair by the door. After 16 straight... Posted by Nicole McDonald on Friday, October 14, 2016

The moment capped an end to an agonizing wait for the boys’ parents.

The McDonalds and Montefiore hospital invited CNN to document this remarkable and rare journey of Jadon and Anias, allowing CNN exclusive access into the operating room throughout the procedure.

Yet before Nicole and Christian learned their boys were now two individuals, Thursday was a day of high emotion and high stakes, of anxious parents and calm medical professionals. It was a day of uncharted territory and amazing, one-of-a-kind surgical activity.

And amid it all were two infants – beautiful boys with deep brown eyes and a shared swirl of hair at the top of their foreheads. They came into the world together, and became two individual boys overnight.

The parents' worries extend beyond the surgery; they wonder what happens in recovery.

Dr. Goodrich stands in Operating Room Number 10. It’s a drab off-white, and empty of people. Two operating tables sit in the middle of the room, abutted together. A 3D replica of the boys’ heads sits between them.

’I feel good’

It’s 6:52 a.m.

The doctor began his day by skipping breakfast and enjoying a single cappuccino.

It’s been 12 years since he last separated twins conjoined at the head at Montefiore. That was his first ever craniopagus surgery, and he’s learned much since then, performing five other separation surgeries around the world, including Syrian twins in Saudi Arabia earlier this year.

Prior to the mid-1980s, it was accepted medical practice to sacrifice one child on the operating table to save the life of the other. Many times both babies died. If one child made it through surgery, he or she often suffered debilitating brain damage.

Krisanne Johnson/Verbatim for CNN Dr. James T. Goodrich in his office at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore.

Goodrich has pioneered the field. He established the practice of performing the separation of craniopagus twins in several shorter stages, instead of one single operation lasting more than 50 hours. The McDonalds have had three previous operations, each resulting in progressively more separated brains. Today is the fourth and final stage. None of Goodrich’s conjoined twins have died during the operation. His mantra: “Take it easy and slowly and carefully.”

His surgical cap embodies that philosophy: It’s decorated with turtles.

“Don’t change what works,” he says. “Ready to go.”

Within minutes, he and Dr. Oren Tepper – the plastic surgeon charged with reconstructing the boys’ skulls and stitching their heads back together – go to the 10th floor to a corner room where Jadon and Anias are resting with their family.

The doctors exchange pleasantries with Mom, Dad and other family members who crowd the room. Asked how he’s feeling, Goodrich breaks out into a James Brown-like jig. “I feel good,” he croons.

At 7:12 a.m., the boys are wheeled out of the room. Their older brother, Aza, lies with the twins on the stretcher as they’re taken down an elevator and through a phalanx of hallways toward the third floor operating room.

“Open door,” Aza says.

It’s time to say goodbye. Against his will, Aza is taken off the stretcher. “Babies, babies,” he says, reaching toward his brothers.

Mom and Dad kiss their boys bye. “We’ll see our two boys later,” Christian tells Nicole.

Nicole scoops up Aza and cradles him. The three walk away. The twins go straight into the OR.

It’s 7:18 a.m.

’Failure is not an option’

In a waiting area off the operating room, Goodrich and Tepper huddle with neuroradiologist Joaquim Farinhas.

Farinhas shows off a three-dimensional replica of the boys’ brain vessels that can be pulled apart, revealing exactly how they are fused together. The boys share about an inch-and-a-half diameter of brain tissue.

“This is what I wanted you to see,” Farinhas says, “which is something that is soft and you can actually poke in and cut through.”

Goodrich studies it for a bit before saying, “Ready to rock ’n’ roll.”

“Absolutely,” Farinhas says.

“Failure is not an option,” Goodrich replies. It’s 7:22 a.m.

For the next two hours, the boys are prepped for surgery. The place is a hub of activity, but of steely calm. The boys drift to sleep under anesthesia.

At 9:27 a.m., plastic sheets are placed over their naked bodies, followed by blue surgical drapes. Moments later, their heads are wiped clean and Tepper takes a black marker and outlines incisions from the three previous surgeries.

At 9:36 a.m., neurosurgery nurses Bindu Peter and Treshia Alex conduct what is known as a “timeout” – a required protocol before surgeries. They name both patients on the tables and the operations taking place this day, October 13, 2016.

“We are doing craniopagus separation, fasciocutaneous scalp flaps, removal of expander, cranioplasty with bone graft, possible skin graft or use skin substitute, adjacent tissue transfer scalp, possible insertion of tissue expanders, possible insertion of wound closure device,” Peter says.

“Correct.”

More than 20 people in the room – surgeons, doctors, nurses, staff – say their names and titles.

“How long will the case take?” says Peter.

Goodrich: “Long.”

“Any patient-specific concerns?” the nurse asks.

“Bleeding,” one voice says.

“We have cross-matched two units of blood. It is in the blood bank,” Peter responds.

“Correct,” Goodrich.

There’s some small talk, then Goodrich motions with his hands to Peter, as if to say you’re forgetting something. “Final line?” he says.

“May the surgeon do a wonderful job,” one doctor says.

Others chime with “A wonderful job!” and “Good luck!”

Goodrich flashes a thumbs up: “Thank you.”

It’s time to operate. Tepper makes the first incision at 9:45 a.m.

Krisanne Johnson/Verbatim for CNN Dr. James T. Goodrich holds a 3D model of the McDonald's twins in his office at Montefiore.

’The easiest part is done’

The next several hours are a whir of activity. In the three previous surgeries, the surgical team added tissue expanders to stretch the skin to make sure there was enough to cover their new skulls. Surgeons also separated some of the veins to make way for today’s final separation.

Mom and Dad eat breakfast with their extended family and take Aza to a nearby park. Nicole is relieved to have Aza to look after because chasing after him keeps her anxiety in check.

Christian goes to a dollar store and buys packs of thank you cards. He and Nicole spend more than an hour writing personal notes to their closest friends and family for helping them get this far.

The family holes up in the Caregiver Support Center, two floors and two corridors away from the operating room. Shortly after CNN’s first story about the family appears Thursday morning, Nicole and Christian start getting swamped with messages from friends and strangers alike. They monitor the hashtag #JadonAndAnias and watch as thousands of dollars in donations pour into their GoFundMe page.

They’re buoyed by the messages of support from people as far away as the Philippines and Germany. They say their faith is renewed in mankind – that it’s a nice break from sordid headlines and the hotly contested political season.

Humanity wins.

“Everybody is really showing how much they love these boys,” Christian says. “I didn’t realize how many people out there have so much good in them and how much they want to help.”

Nicole had quit her job as a pediatric physical therapist to care for the twins. She reads notes from mothers whose children she once cared for, including one who nicknamed her “Miracle Worker.” On her Facebook page, that mother writes, “Nicole is a Miracle Worker and now we’re seeing miracles worked in her life.”

“They’re all just so heartfelt,” Nicole says.

By noon, the surgical team has taken out one tissue expander and removed some temporary plates that were inserted in the earlier surgeries to hold bone back.

At 12:04 p.m., it’s time to turn the boys to get to a new area to cut – a delicate maneuver that requires all hands on deck.

“1, 2, 3, lift!” a team member says.

Jadon’s shoulders rotate 45 degrees. They adjust Anias into a similar position. Tepper remains calm, continuing his work.

Goodrich stands and turns away from the table. He grabs a nearby 3D replica of the boys’ conjoined skulls. A wine connoisseur, he studies it, mulls it over like a fine chardonnay. He’s facing two large screen televisions. One shows a live view of the surgery going on behind him. The other provides images of three-dimensional computer models of the boys’ veins, arteries and other brain matter.

Soon, Goodrich returns to the table. Working diligently with him is Tepper and three other surgeons: Dr. Rani Nasser and Dr. Ajit Jada, both chief residents of neurosurgery, and Dr. Carrie Stern, senior resident of plastic surgery.

The high-pitched sounds of tiny cutting instruments pierce the air. A smell, not unlike that of having a cavity filled at the dentist’s office, permeates all around.

At 1:55 p.m, more than four hours into the surgery, Goodrich turns around and says, “The easiest part is done.”

Fifteen minutes later, a chunk of skull is removed. No time to rest. The surgical team presses on. They take out a second tissue expander shortly before 3 p.m.

Soon after, Goodrich sneaks off for two slices of pizza in a quiet, secluded room in the hospital. Nineteen minutes later, he heads back to the operating room.

’Land of the unknown’

Nicole and Christian bide their time with family. Aza bounces off the walls. Grandparents and others pitch in to keep the 3-year-old from driving their mom and dad too crazy.

Mom enjoys the distraction. They get occasional updates on the surgery from a nurse practitioner for pediatric neurosurgery. Christian wishes they’d get more news on how it’s going.

The family members wear white T-shirts Nicole designed. The front of the shirt says Anias with its Hebrew meaning, “God has answered,” and Jadon, “God has heard.” An infinity sign – often used as a symbol for conjoined twins – goes across the middle.

Nicole made the shirts to try to raise a few bucks. Soon, she had 200 orders. The family ended up selling 1,000.

“I’m gonna hug my wife,” Christian says, pulling her tight and holding her.

The time now is 4:46 p.m.

The day has been a whirlwind since saying goodbye to the boys nine hours earlier.

Nicole had never even posted a photograph depicting the boys as conjoined until a month ago.

She always took tight shots of each boy’s face to show them as individuals. But she knew she wanted to speak to CNN and needed to be brave to “better prepare myself for exposing my children to the world.”

So, she posted one photo of the boys conjoined on Facebook and then another on her GoFundMe page. “I said, ‘OK, I’m getting real brave.’”

“The response was beautiful,” she says.

And now, this day, her boys’ day of separation – a symbolic “second birthday” – the outpouring of love has been awesome.

“The babies steal the show,” Christian says.

Nicole: “It’s their eyes.”

“We would have it no other way, though,” Christian responds.

It’s now past 5 p.m. As the day progresses, they know their anxiety will intensify. Their boys have gone through the three prior surgeries, and they know the doctors are still making their way through basically undoing those three surgeries before going into the final separation phase.

“I call it the land of the unknown,” Nicole says.

Yet their worries extend beyond their boys surviving today. They wonder what happens with recovery. Will they have seizures? Will they suffer heart failure? How long will they be in intensive care?

Despite their worries, Nicole says, “When we sent them off this morning, to me, I felt at peace with it and just ready to handle what comes after.”

The most critical phase

Shortly before 9 p.m., the operating room intensifies. The surgeons have reached their most critical phase: They must separate the shared blood vessels between the two boys. Veins are very thin walled, and one section of Jadon and Anias’ brains are intricately tied together, much more so than originally believed.

A single cut that goes too deep can lead to catastrophic bleeding.

Neuroradiologist Joaquim Farinhas stands in front of the screen displaying the 3D computer model. He calls Dr. Ajit Jada over from the operating table and points at the cluster of veins. Farinhas dispenses advice. Jada returns to the table.

“Be very gentle with Anias’ side,” Farinhas calls out to the surgical team.

Tepper, who had taken a brief break, returns to the table.

“It’s a bear,” says Farinhas.

“This is the most important part,” he explains, “because the vessels are so delicate and they’re so complicated. It’s almost a lake of veins that they’re trying to negotiate. It’s pretty amazing.”

The surgical team has to figure out: How do you tie it off safely? How do you separate it? Should we proceed?

At 9:18 p.m., Goodrich says, “We just closed off the sagittal sinus.”

“That chardonnay is on the way,” quips Farinhas.

A note of levity amid the intensity.

The last stitch

Seconds tick off into minutes, which turn into hours.

The surgery is meticulous, tricky, complex. And that’s an understatement.

At 1:18 a.m., Tepper, the plastic surgeon, steps to a nearby metallic table and takes a special saw to split a removed skull piece into two. Those two pieces will be used for the boys’ new skullcaps.

Goodrich and his team continue to work away toward the moment of separation. At about 1:40 a.m., he sits in a seat next to the operating table with hands crossed, as if admiring the work. Moments later, he stands and dives right back into surgery.

At 2:10 a.m., Goodrich says, “One more inch.”

“We’re ready. You ready?” one surgeon says.

“Yep,” Goodrich says.

It’s a badge of honor as to who gets the last cut when separating conjoined twins.

“The last stitch,” Tepper says. “Who wants it?”

The only woman surgeon at the table, Dr. Carrie Stern, makes the historic last cut, at 2:11 a.m.

“We are official,” Goodrich says.

The room bursts into spontaneous applause.

After nearly 16½ hours, the boys are separated.",2016-10-14 00:00:00
The guru's gift: Staying calm in a world of chaos,"New York (CNN) They arrive by the hundreds, walking through metal detectors, placing their belongings on conveyor belts to be X-rayed.

They're passing through intense security in search of serenity.

It's a warm New York evening, and these seekers are streaming onto the North Lawn of UN Headquarters to take part in the International Day of Yoga, a mass celebration of a discipline believed to date back thousands of years.

Among them are seasoned yogis in matching outfits who stand on their heads to relax. A landscape contractor in jeans kicks off his work boots and admits he's never done this before. A mother brings her two young children, determined to give them a break from their iPads.

Sirens and traffic roar along nearby streets as a guru from halfway around the world takes the stage with his right-hand colleague and other like-minded guides.

For at least a few hours, Rishikesh has come to the Big Apple, and I'm here to reclaim something I once found.

On mats dotting the UN's North Lawn, participants try to block out city noise in search of peace.

Rushing toward tranquility

A sea of pedestrians moves me along. Surrounded by strangers, many wearing earbuds or staring at gadgets, I cross against reds, too impatient to stop and stand still.

Yoga on the lawn is still 24 hours away, but I can't wait.

I'm off to see two people who once helped change my life. They're spiritual leaders from the largest ashram in Rishikesh -- one of India's spiritual hot spots -- and they're here to carry the message of yoga's power.

Hindu pilgrims have long made their way to Rishikesh, considered the birthplace of yoga -- and the yoga capital of the world. So have Westerners seeking enlightenment, ever since the Beatles went in 1968 to study Transcendental Meditation with the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

I went for several weeks in 2014 to write about those who flock there, what they're searching for and what they find. What I didn't see coming was a transformation of my own, one that freed me of long-held hurts and opened my heart in new ways.

That gift stayed with me for a while. But 8,000 miles away and three years later, ugly politics, threats from social media trolls, even the mundane challenges of rush hour gridlock can chip away at tranquility.

There's no tranquility for the man on a bicycle who screams obscenities at the taxi driver who cut him off. Or the woman who groans and rolls her eyes when a slow-walking tourist blocks her path.

The honks of cars sound an urban symphony as I turn the corner toward the building where my Rishikesh friends are staying.

I stroll by the tony Plaza Hotel, peer up at addresses along Central Park South and pass a Trump property. I laugh to myself, thinking about the contrast between where they've come from and where they've landed.

Nearly 3,000 people registered to take part in International Day of Yoga activities at the UN.

'Face your book'

The first time I spoke with Swami Chidanand Saraswatiji, we sat on thin mats atop a cow-dung floor inside the ashram he leads in the foothills of the Himalayas.

This time, inside a devotee's apartment, the floors are pristine marble, and we sink into designer furniture while overlooking Central Park.

Swamiji, as I came to know him, wears saffron robes, and his smile is as gentle and warm as I remember. He places his hands over his heart in greeting.

We speak about what he hopes to convey during this trip, and his wisdom and gift for wordplay is still evident:

""The internet can take you to the world of information, but the 'inner-net' can take you to the world of inspiration.""

""Going on Facebook is not enough. You have to face your book also. When you face your book, you know where you stand.""

""Whether you're becoming bitter or better, whether you're in peace or in pieces ... you have to watch. You have to introspect.""

I learn that this man, who spent eight years of his childhood meditating alone in a jungle, has been to New York City 90 times -- but has never visited the Statue of Liberty. I can't help but ask what he makes of this chaotic concrete jungle.

""Chaos is not outside of us; chaos is inside of us,"" he answers. ""In the chaos also you can find calmness. In the midst of the noise also you can be noiseless. That's what yoga gives you.""

This sounds great, but what if the world around you, the work you do, the tensions of your nation fuel your anxiety? How can you possibly find calmness or manage your stress?

Focus on ""self-management,"" Swamiji, 65, says with a knowing grin. ""All is not well until you are well. Simple!""

I tell him I need to work harder to follow his advice.

""Rishikesh,"" he answers. ""Recharge your batteries and come back.""

Swami Chidanand Saraswatiji traveled from the mountains of the Himalayas to the skyscrapers of Manhattan to help lead the festivities.

Interrupting the calm

It was easy to stay grounded in a place where my days revolved around yoga classes, meditation, meetings with holy men in caves and sessions with gurus. But holding on to what I felt in Rishikesh ebbs and flows back home, which is what brings me to the UN's North Lawn.

Tables are covered in products that promise fulfillment. There's a cookbook for the body and mind, a stack of Ayurvedic soaps for holistic cleansing and a copy of ""Meditation & Mantras"" by Swami Vishnu Devananda.

People get situated on their yoga mats. But before they embrace stillness, they bat around the names of their favorite studios, pass around pamphlets for retreats and offer CDs bearing titles like ""The Miracle of You.""

A woman wearing a hijab sits, legs crossed and eyes closed. A businessman in a suit can't resist glancing at his phone and tiptoes away to make a call. Another woman begins to weep while thanking the manager of a Catskills ashram for changing her life.

On the stage overlooking the lawn, Swamiji sits cross-legged in his chair. He's joined by other yoga experts, a kirtan master and musician, a spoken-word performer and Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati, a woman he works with who's become his sidekick of sorts.

Sadhviji, as I call her, emerged a friend and a touchstone during my time in India.

Originally from Los Angeles, Sadhviji has called Rishikesh home for more than 20 years.

She shares Swamiji's spiritual outlook as well as his commitment to protecting the environment. She also directs the International Yoga Festival each year at their ashram, Parmath Niketan.

She speaks of yoga's ability to promote balance, an ethical life, and physical and mental well-being. How one gets to yoga -- through meditation, chanting or physical exertion -- is less important than getting there.

""Yoga,"" which translates to ""union,"" is ""the union of my breath to my body, the union of the self to the divine,"" Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati said.

She likens it to the sacred river Ganga, or the Ganges, which is believed to give life, rejuvenate and liberate. It changed her from the moment she arrived in Rishikesh and dipped her feet in the water.

It doesn't matter if you walk into the Ganga from a sandy beach, step into it from marble steps or leap into it from a rock, she says. ""The goal is to get in. It's the same with yoga.""

Across the North Lawn, the crowd of seekers follows the cues from the teachers on stage, closing their eyes, bringing themselves into the moment.

My eyes remain open as I take notes, and between their moments of calm, I feel the vibrations of my work phone as new emails come in.

The seekers follow instructions, drawing energy toward their spines and connecting ""to the universal energy of the breath.""

My phone vibrates, alerting me to a bombing in Brussels.

They twist their bodies into triangle pose, exhale slowly and relax.

My phone reminds me of Otto Warmbier, the American who died the day before after being released from North Korean custody.

They pray for peace and listen to reminders to ""meet hate with love, meet fear with compassion.""

My phone prompts memories of Michael Brown, the unarmed black 18-year-old whose wrongful death lawsuit has just settled.

""Be a yogi that dares to care about the happiness and freedom of all beings without exception,"" one of the teachers says to those assembled.

My phone tells me more about Nabra Hassaneen, a Muslim teen who was killed near a Virginia mosque days before.

Between ceremonies and talks, under the guidance of yoga experts and spiritual leaders, New Yorkers reached for balance.

Fluffing my aura

Sadhviji and I exchange texts the next morning. I hope to steal some time with her and Swamiji before my flight home.

I feel like I need more, that there are questions I still want answered. I don't even know exactly what I want to ask, but anything else they can give me, I'll take.

The wi-fi seems to be down, and my cell is running out of juice. I pack up, count my electronics -- two phones, a laptop, a FitBit -- but don't seem to have enough chargers.

The results of a special election back home bring a flood of Facebook posts, replete with expletives and testimonies of tears. My phone buzzes: It's my chiropractor and massage therapist, reminding me it's time for a tuneup. On the television, morning news pundits debate the future of health care in the US.

I imagine that while all of this goes on, Swamiji is deep in meditation and completely unfazed.

I return to the UN to attend a ""Conversation on Yoga for Health,"" but also because I'm told I can meet with Swamiji after the talk. Security won't let me on the chamber floor, though, so I sit in my seat up above and watch.

A woman beside me, visiting from California, offers me her CD of music and a link to her website. She calls herself a ""Shamanatrix"" and is in the business of promoting a ""Love.o.lution."" She hands me an ""aura fluffer"" wand, colorful feathers connected to a looped pipe cleaner. By waving it around my head and body, she shows me, I can offer myself kindness and compassion. She hopes it will make me smile. It does; I can't stop grinning.

Swamiji and Sadhviji are joined by other headliners, including an acclaimed Bollywood actor, a CEO who's brought mindfulness to the workplace and a former NFL player-turned-yogi. An official from the World Health Organization lays out yoga's benefits, how it helps reduce high blood pressure, strengthen pulmonary function and prevent depression and stress.

Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

Swamiji, who likes to say ""meditation is the best medication,"" recalls the saints who lived in caves in the jungle where he meditated as a boy.

""No Pizza Hut, no Starbucks, no Amazon.com -- nothing was available,"" he says. ""Nothing was set in their lives ... but personally, they were set. Their minds were set; their hearts were set; they were happy all the time.""

And as a result, he says, their health was set. What he sees today is a world in need of an adjustment.

""In our lives, everything is set, but we are upset,"" he says. ""What is the key to being set and healthy in body and mind? The answer and the secret is yoga.""

We don't need to retreat to caves in the mountains above Rishikesh to find the answers, he says. ""You can create your own cave right here.""

The session ends, and people swarm around them on the chamber floor. I stand from my seat and watch. I'm too far to reach them and know, given my flight back home, that I won't have time to wait.

But I also realize I don't require any more guidance from my Rishikesh teachers. These past few days have reminded me: What I need is already inside me.

So with my ""aura fluffer"" in hand, I walk back onto the city streets, where I stop at every red light, stand still, smile and breathe.",2017-07-19 00:00:00
When you wish your baby had never been born,"Cypress, Texas (CNN) Dortha Biggs enters through the front door and rushes to greet her daughter, Lesli, who sits in a recliner, curled in fetal position.

Mother and daughter lock hands and begin a ritualistic rubbing of hands, the only way they can communicate. It's rhythmic and intimate, beautiful and heartbreaking. Lesli squeals as her mother holds her right hand and pats her left.

A smile starts to radiate from Lesli's face.

""Looka there,"" Dortha says. ""Are you going to smile? Can you smile? There's that smile!""

Ever since Lesli was born 48 years ago, Dortha has longed to hear her daughter say a single word. She cried more tears than anyone can imagine, rocking young Lesli every night for years on end. Mom would get maybe an hour or two of sleep before heading off to her teaching job.

""Because you just care so much,"" Dortha says.

Dortha contracted rubella when she was 2½ weeks pregnant, before she even knew that she was expecting. Although she got better, the virus took root in her fetus' bone cells, nerve cells and skin cells. It would leave Lesli blind, deaf and severely brain-damaged. She spent 100 days in the hospital before her first birthday and has undergone more than 20 surgeries over the years, including an open-heart operation at 3 months that left her ribs broken.

Lesli has lived in a Houston-area group home since 2000. Dortha, 77, now lives in Oklahoma and visits as often as she can, about eight times a year. As the two hold hands, Dortha ponders whether her daughter knows who she is.

""I don't think she's aware that I'm her mother,"" she says. ""I think she is aware that I'm someone special who cares about her.""

Dortha Biggs rubs her daughter's hands, the only means they have of communicating.

It's been a grueling journey for both. Mom yearns for the one thing that is unattainable: for Lesli to get better or just to enjoy the simplicities of life. Lesli lives in a dark, silent, isolated world in her group home, unable to communicate with her mother beyond touch.

Four decades earlier, mother and daughter made headlines when the Texas Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling. Dortha had sued her doctor, accusing him of failing to diagnose the rubella. If she'd known, she would have had an abortion.

On February 19, 1975 -- three years after Roe v. Wade -- about 60 women filed into the Supreme Court chamber in unison and took up seats in support of Dortha's case. The women heard a decision that stunned the legal community and reversed lower court rulings that had sided with the doctor.

The high court's ruling set a precedent that said a woman could sue her doctor for a ""wrongful birth.""

Dortha, who stayed home, learned of the ruling through the news.

This year, the news brought Dortha another shock: A Texas state senator had introduced a bill that would ban such lawsuits -- in essence, overturning the precedent she helped set. And he invoked her case, saying wrongful birth lawsuits such as hers promoted abortion.

""The presence of a disability in a child should not be grounds for a lawsuit,"" Sen. Brandon Creighton told his colleagues. ""It sends the message that there are births that are wrongful. There are no wrongful births.""

Dortha was outraged.

Never once did a lawmaker reach out to her. Never was she asked to testify in committee hearings. Never did they ask about Lesli.

If they had, she would have told them of the pain her daughter has suffered since she was born March 8, 1969, in Wichita Falls, Texas. Of traveling more than 100,000 miles to hospitals in Dallas, Baltimore, Washington and San Francisco -- anything to give her little Lesli the best shot in life.

""If you have not watched your daughter suffer pain -- pain that was just hell -- for days and days,"" Dortha says, ""you cannot even grasp the pain that you experience.""

She'd have told those under the Capitol dome how she dedicated her life to special needs children for more than 30 years. Of designing the curriculum for disabled children in public schools, first in Dallas and then in Wichita Falls.

Lesli's portrait hangs on the wall at the group home where she lives.

Tormented by the virus that wrecked her child, she wrote her master's thesis on rubella and its devastating effects in pregnancy.

Many nights, Dortha weeps.

""I would have given anything to have never been born,"" she says. ""Because had I not been born, she would not have been born and suffered this.""

A legal legacy

Dortha is like a hawk, making sure Lesli's hair is cut short so she won't yank it out, checking to make sure her wheelchair works and monitoring the cleanliness of her bedroom.

The day after her visit, a scene reminiscent of the 1975 Texas Supreme Court ruling played out across the state in Austin.

More than a dozen women dressed in long red robes and white bonnets sat in the chamber of the Texas Senate, their outfits matching characters from ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" the popular dystopian novel that explores themes of power, gender and religion in politics.

They were there to protest two anti-abortion measures, including the bill that would undo Dortha's legal legacy.

It's a saga that began in the summer of 1968. Deposition transcripts tell the story:

Dortha had fallen ill with ""nausea, shivering attacks, cramping of the stomach"" during a July Fourth trip with her husband to Port Aransas on the Texas coast.

A pinpoint rash broke out across the top of her face and eventually extended ""downward to other portions"" of her body, including her legs.

The possibility of being pregnant was the last thing on her mind. She was 28 and on birth control. She had a son and had planned to have a second child sometime down the road.

She spoke by phone with Dr. Louis M. Theimer, the well-regarded family practitioner in Wichita Falls who opened his practice in 1953 and delivered hundreds, if not thousands, of the town's babies. He'd delivered Dortha's first child, Jake, on December 24, 1961.

Theimer had seen her just before the trip. She wasn't feeling well then, but she told him she was feeling much worse now.

Dortha and her husband of 32 years, Tom Biggs, visit Lesli as often as they can.

She first saw a doctor in Port Aransas and was given antibiotics. When she returned home, she was still ill. She saw Theimer on July 11, 1968. He believed she might be pregnant and ran a test. She mentioned that she had a rash on her vacation but didn't ask about the possibility of rubella, also known as German measles -- at least not yet.

Four days later, Dortha returned and was informed that she was indeed pregnant. She broke down, fearing that the rash was rubella and that her fetus would be harmed.

It was the summer of 1968. A rubella epidemic had swept across the United States from 1963 to 1965. The diagnosis during pregnancy was a deep fear among any expectant mother, similar to how Zika took hold in Central and South America last summer. Rubella was known to cause deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness, seizures and extreme intellectual disabilities. If the mother got rubella in the first two months of pregnancy, it was known to be especially debilitating, continuing to live in the child long after birth.

""I was alarmed,"" Dortha testified. ""He told me the test was positive and I was pregnant.""

""I said ... 'Could this rash that I had have been measles?' And his statement was, 'No, if you hadn't had measles (as a child), you would have had them in the '64-'65 epidemic.' ""

In his deposition, Theimer equivocated when asked about that conversation but acknowledged that he believed her rash was from an antibiotic, not rubella.

Three times during her pregnancy, Dortha's body tried to spontaneously abort. Believing her child to be healthy, each time she agreed for shots to be administered to stop her contractions and save the fetus.

""After I was told I did not have rubella, I very definitely wanted the baby,"" she testified.

And what would she have done if she'd been informed that she had rubella?

""I would have done the kindest thing that I could have known to have done for her,"" Dortha said, ""and that would have been to terminate the pregnancy.""

Abortions were illegal in Texas at the time. She said she would've traveled to Colorado for the procedure.

Theimer acknowledged that he never ran a test on Dortha to determine the presence of rubella antibodies. ""No, I never did,"" he said.

Born blind, deaf and severely brain-damaged, Lesli Jacobs lives in a silent world.

A Christian, the doctor said he had no religious scruples against abortion. He added that he would inform patients if he believed they have ""a possibility of having a deformed fetus.""

""That's what I tell them, but I think the choice after that is theirs,"" Theimer said.

""I agree with you. That's the whole case,"" Dortha's attorney shot back. ""Doctor, did you give this patient of yours that choice medically?""

""No,"" he said. ""I didn't think she ever had rubella.""

'No right to judge'

It's those words that still haunt, still sting. Time has not healed the wounds of the doctor's misdiagnosis.

""Now, they're punishing me again,"" she says of the legislation at the state Capitol.

The fact that Creighton, the bill's author, implied that people like her were just looking for a payout, she says, is ""beyond insulting."" Creighton also argued that the mere threat of wrongful birth suits kept the best doctors from setting up practice in Texas and could lead to a shortage.

To this, Dortha says, ""Despicable.""

""It would've been nice if they'd just contacted me.""

Infuriated at the news of the measure, her fingers clapped at her keyboard as she typed a letter to Creighton.

""I have stood over her bed for hundreds of nights watching her suffering,"" she wrote. ""If you have not experienced this heartbreak, you have no right to judge.""

Dortha and Lesli made headlines when the Texas Supreme Court agreed parents could sue doctors for ""wrongful birth.""

After the Supreme Court ruling, her family received about $120,000 in a settlement reached with Theimer -- money that was placed in a special needs trust for Lesli. At the time, the family owed $21,472 in medical bills. Back then, Dortha made just $4,200 a year as a teacher.

After the suit, she was forced to move from Wichita Falls to Dallas because doctors back home refused to treat her two children. Her marriage to Lesli's father didn't survive the move.

Dortha has left the money in the trust mostly untouched in recent years, preferring to pay Lesli's out-of-pocket costs with her own money. It's a burden she's more than willing to take on. That way, there is money left for Lesli's care long after Mom is gone.

Dortha keeps a yellow scrapbook called ""The First Six Years."" The first page announces Lesli's birth, hailing the 6-pound, 10½-ounce girl. Next to it, a black-and-white photograph shows Lesli with her mouth open and both fists clenched.

Memories burst from the album's pages. Lesli's 7-year-old brother, Jake, beams on the couch, his little sister in his arms. On her 4th birthday, Lesli sits in front of a giant cake shaped like a teddy bear.

The message below, like others in the scrapbook, is in Lesli's voice, written as her mother imagined it: ""I have now learned to sit alone, and in four more months, I will crawl. My teachers worked on helping me sit for over three years.""

Turn the page. Lesli is sprawled out, crawling. ""I no longer have to just lie where someone places me.""

But there are sobering reminders, too.

""At one time, I took over 40 medications daily.""

""If only you could hear me long enough to say, 'I love you.' ""

On the back page is a final note, which Dortha reads in a soft, hushed Texas twang.

""This has been the story of my first 6 years. I have brought a new kind of love and strength into the lives of many,"" she reads.

""I have fought hard and suffered to live. Very few days of my life are without pain, but still I smile.""

Dortha, right, and her husband have spent countless hours touching and stroking Lesli.

Mom closes the book and uses tissue to dab her eyes.

""I did try for so long to think that things would be a lot better, and then you start accepting,"" she says. ""You have to learn to accept that some things are going to just be.""

Dortha accepted that the milestones would become few and far between. Lesli would never learn to stand on her own. She would never speak. She would never hear her mom's words: ""I love you.""

Who gets to decide?

Lesli sits in a wheelchair in her room, her head hunched over. She sports a crew cut. If her hair grows out much more than an inch, she'll pull it out. One of her eyes was removed due to cataracts. Her other is so deteriorated, it's hard to tell whether it's even there.

Her group home sits in a cul-de-sac in Cypress, Texas, about 25 miles northwest of Houston. The spacious three-bedroom brick home with wood siding blends in well with the four residential homes on the street. The only thing that distinguishes the house is the specialty van with wheelchair access in the driveway.

It's a home she shares with five others, all of whom receive round-the-clock care.

The letters L-E-S-L-I gaze down from the wall above her bed. Next to them rests a cowboy hat.

Dortha rubs her daughter's right hand. Dortha's husband of 32 years, Tom Biggs, runs his fingers back and forth across the back of her neck. Dortha decided he was a keeper when he didn't cut and run like most guys upon seeing the severity of Lesli's disabilities.

""He has patted hands as many hours as I have,"" she says.

Dortha never gave birth to another child. Shortly after Lesli was born, she was told that her baby was perfect. She had her tubes tied three days later. The following week, Dortha spotted cataracts in her daughter's eyes, the start of the arduous journey they're still traveling.

Standing over her daughter, Dortha has a message for the senator who drafted the bill. ""Senator Creighton has not stood where I have stood or walked in my shoes. He has not,"" she says. ""He has not stood and watched a child suffer like this.""

She says it's interesting that the current administration in Washington, as well as Texas lawmakers, wants to deregulate everything from the EPA to banks to businesses. ""But when it comes to the most intimate decisions an individual has to make, it's 'let's put more regulations on that.'

""I'm the one who should have made the decision.""

Does she still wish her daughter had never been born?

""Yes,"" she says.

Lesli has lived in this group home since 2000; she shares it with five others.

Holding her daughter's right hand, Dortha chokes up. Lesli places her mother's right hand on the back of her neck. Mom strokes her daughter's head. Tom rubs Lesli's left arm.

Mom continues talking through her tears: ""Because I have had the joy of loving her, but I've had the sorrow of watching her suffer. She has suffered so much of her life. If she could have come through the suffering and come through it and be able to enjoy her life more, I think it would have been a different issue.""

Mother and daughter now hold hands. Lesli moans. ""But, no, I could never have said I want her to experience this -- just to be born. Anyone who would say they thought that was the right thing to do has not stood and watched a child suffer like this.""

She understands that those words in her daughter's presence might come across as cruel or twisted, but she reiterates that it's for the love of her daughter and the freedom from her pain that she wishes she'd had an abortion or allowed her body to abort naturally.

""I could never have made the choice to have terminated the pregnancy for me or the hardships that it would bring on me,"" she says. ""But I could have in a heartbeat for her -- knowing what she was going to go through.'""

'The wrong message'

More than a dozen specialty vans line up about 8:30 a.m. at a community center about 15 minutes from Lesli's home. It's on the grounds of the faith-based nonprofit that runs Lesli's home and several others in the surrounding area.

Every weekday, about 70 residents from the various group homes are driven to the center for specialized treatment.

It's the first day of spring, and the Texas heat is already suffocating, pushing 80 degrees.

Lesli is helped from her van in her wheelchair and escorted into a cavernous building with polished floors. She comes here for therapy and worship.

Once in class, Lesli takes up a seat in a beige recliner and relaxes. Class leader Catherine Konneh brings over bean bags and rubber balls so she can feel them. Lesli pushes them away.

Konneh tries a variety of scents to arouse her olfactory senses. Lesli holds her nose over the smell of strawberry and takes in the aroma.

Konneh's goal for Lesli is to someday wash her hands on her own. ""I keep (the residents) active,"" she says, ""so that whatever skills they have, they won't lose them.""

Next, everyone moves to the fellowship hall, where therapy dogs greet the crowd. Lesli seems more interested in the touch of the dog handlers than the dogs. She grabs the trainers' hands and places them on the back of her neck. When a fluffy white dog named Lammie licks her face, she backs up her wheelchair.

But a black pooch named Omri makes a breakthrough. Omri places one paw on her leg, and she pets him with the help of the handler.

Lesli pushed away bean bags and rubber balls but welcomed the chance to pet Omri with his handler's help.

By early afternoon, Lesli, Dortha and Tom meet with staff for her annual review, going over her care for the upcoming year. The severity of her disabilities are rattled off: blind, deaf, cerebral palsy, allergies, seizure disorder, autism.

Even the most minute details are covered. All tags on her shirts must be cut off because they annoy her. Her wheelchair footrest must be down at all times to keep her from falling. Pay attention to her picking at her underwear. She prefers hot lunches, preferably noodles with no MSG.

Lesli moans through much of the session and plays with Konneh's hands while Mom listens.

Her care for the upcoming year will cost about $200,000. Medicare and Medicaid will cover most of it.

More than two hours away in Austin, state senators take up the wrongful birth bill.

Dressed in a navy suit and light blue tie, Creighton stands on the floor and tells his colleagues that Senate Bill 25 prohibits ""patients from suing their physician for lifelong payments, claiming that they would not have had their baby had they known different information. It removes the wrongful birth cause of action.""

He says doctors currently are ""overcautiously suggesting termination in order to protect themselves.""

Democratic Sen. Jose Rodriguez of El Paso pushes back, saying the current law exists to protect women like Dortha and remains relevant even today. He said the Texas Supreme Court found that the doctor ""had failed to carry out his obligation of fully informing the patient.""

""It's about ultimately the woman's right to receive accurate information from her doctor, so she can make an informed choice,"" Rodriguez says.

The bill sails through. It must now go before the House for final approval.

Creighton soaks in the moment not too long after the vote. He tells CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that it is time for the ""archaic 40-year-old cause of action"" to go away.

""It just sends the wrong message,"" he says. ""It sends a message that the best physicians in America should not practice in Texas because ... you have to consider that you could be held liable just for doing your job correctly.""

Told that's not true -- and certainly not what happened in Dortha's case -- Creighton insists that he's correct because lawyers are clever and ""you can be sued for anything.""

Lesli touches the plants as she is wheeled outside. On weekdays, she attends therapy at a nearby community center.

Asked why he never contacted Dortha, he offers several answers. First, he says it's because of privacy concerns -- even though he brought her case into the fight. Then, he says he can't contact everyone from past cases about new legislation. He says he plans to respond to her letter but hasn't had time. He says he hopes to meet her one day.

He says he was especially moved by her ""exceptional"" letter. ""I'm very, very proud of her, almost to a heroic standpoint, just what it takes to raise a child and the challenges in disabilities.""

Legal experts say wrongful birth suits are rarely filed and certainly don't scare doctors from opening up practice in Texas. One former director of the Texas Medical Board told a Senate panel that her agency had investigated only five wrongful birth cases since 1975, according to Courthouse News Service.

And while Creighton maintains that an expectant mother who is given a wrong diagnosis during pregnancy would still have other means to pursue a lawsuit, legal scholars say that is not true.

If you take away the wrongful birth cause of action, ""there is no other action,"" said George Annas, director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at Boston University.

""What this guy doesn't like is making a decision to terminate a pregnancy,"" Annas said. ""He doesn't want you to do that.""

That motivation was on display just before Creighton answered CNN's questions. A lawmaker stopped by and slapped him on the back: ""Congratulations, you're the only senator who's gotten a pro-life bill through this session.""

The irony, Dortha says, is that the first thing to go when GOP-led legislatures begin slashing budgets is money for programs serving the special-needs and mentally ill communities. Put more precisely, she says, they care only when a child is in the womb, not after.

""They don't love my daughter. They don't know my daughter,"" she says.

If they cared, she says, they would have contacted her. They would have toured her daughter's group home. They would have held Lesli's hand.",2017-04-04 00:00:00
Stopping the opioid crisis in the womb,"Knoxville, Tennessee (CNN) The sound of a heartbeat pulsates through the air, and a grainy image of a baby flashes on screen. Jessica Hill smiles from her chair in the ultrasound room.

Gathered around are her doctor, nurse and best friend.

They are all eager, anxious, excited -- and worried about the health of the baby. In that way, this ultrasound is like most.

But what's happening in this room is anything but routine: Jessica, 28, is hooked on opioids and detoxing during pregnancy. Dr. Craig Towers is the pioneering -- and controversial -- obstetrician shattering the common medical belief that this approach could lead to the death of the fetus.

Moments earlier, Jessica's baby underwent a stress test to see how she was progressing, a way to make sure the stress of detoxing is not harming the child. ""She didn't like it at all,"" says Jessica, who is in her 35th week of pregnancy.

""It means that she's paying attention to what's going on,"" says Towers, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies at the University of Tennessee Medical Center.

Jessica admits to making many mistakes, but here, she is making what she says is the best choice of her life: getting clean for her baby. She also has an 8-year-old son who has been raised by her mom. She hopes detoxing will further heal their relationship.

A tattoo above her heart reads ""From pain comes strength.""

She wishes she could lean over her belly, put her lips by her daughter's head and whisper to her about life lessons. ""I'm working on building our relationship and trying so hard. I mainly want her to know that I won't make those choices any more.""

Jessica marvels at the screen. ""Is that her little face?""

""Yeah, that's a cheek,"" Towers says.

""She's got chubby cheeks,"" Jessica replies.

Jessica Hill, 28, was hooked on opioids and wanted to get clean, but she was told that detoxing would kill her fetus.

When Jessica first came to Towers four months ago, she was taking a standard opioid-based maintenance medication, called Subutex, meant to keep her from getting her fix from the street. She had been told at a drug maintenance clinic that detoxing would kill her fetus.

When she went to a doctor who she hoped could deliver her child, Jessica was humiliated. She had informed the doctor she was taking Subutex to tamp down her urge for painkillers. The doctor, she says, told her they don't ""take irresponsible patients.""

""I was just so upset, because they just shunned us away,"" she says.

The maintenance clinic then referred her to the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Jessica first visited a doctor at the hospital's prenatal clinic in December and was introduced to Emily Katz, the substance abuse coordinator in Towers' office. Katz saw a young woman who needed help -- but, more important, wanted help.

""We snatched her up,"" she says. ""There was just a spark in her. When I told Jessica, 'I think we can help you,' tears just streamed down her face.""

It's now mid-March. Towers has weaned Jessica off the medication slowly, with Jessica making the hour-long trip from her home in Morristown to his office every two weeks, almost always accompanied by her best friend, Stephanie Moore. Today, Stephanie chimes in with cheerful jokes about the baby's stubbornness, similar to her mother's.

In between visits, Jessica texts and phones Katz, who was motivated to help others after her brother died of an overdose. The two have become so close over the months that both say they're like twins separated at birth. Jessica has nicknamed Katz ""Nurse Barbie"" for her attractiveness and her straight blonde hair.

On this day, Katz quietly observes during the ultrasound, making her show of support by just being there.

Jessica went completely off the opioids over the past week, a critical juncture during any detoxification. She suffered through diarrhea and other ailments. Only once did she give into her urge, taking one Subutex pill. ""It sucks,"" she says.

In those down moments, Stephanie and Katz remind her why she's going through this: that the struggle is worth the pain.

But even with all that Jessica has endured, there's no guarantee her baby will be free of the violent tremors and excruciating pain that marks those born to addicted mothers. About one in five women who detox in Towers' program still sees her baby suffer withdrawal after birth, depending on how early in pregnancy the mothers were able to become drug-free and how their bodies metabolize the opioids still in their systems.

Dr. Craig Towers has helped more than 500 women detox during pregnancy: ""It's the right thing to do.""

Towers assures Jessica that her baby will be safe if she continues to not use. With the due date a month away, he says he wants to begin seeing her twice a week to make sure she stays on track.

Her pregnancy was not planned, and Jessica worries that child services could take her daughter away because of her history of drug abuse.

""The only way they would take her from you is if you were using something off the street or if there's something in your drug screen that wasn't prescribed to you,"" Towers says. ""That's why I just want to see you a lot, make sure you're doing OK, and if there's any issues, we prevent a relapse.""

The next few weeks will prove critical. Jessica will lean on this supportive cast: the doctor, her best friend and ""Nurse Barbie.""

Towers knows all too well what's at stake. Three days earlier, an expectant woman who he hoped would enroll in his program was found dead of an overdose, the first such death this year in Knox County.

Concerns over relapse risk

Every 25 minutes in America, a baby is born in withdrawal from opioids . They shake violently, vomit constantly and scream incessantly. Upon arrival in this world, one of the first things the newborns are given is an opioid to lessen the intensity of their shakes.

Delivery rooms have become overwhelmed, especially along the Appalachia corridor stretching from Ohio and West Virginia into Kentucky and down to this northeast corner of Tennessee. The average hospital stay for a baby suffering withdrawal lasts about 17 days, costing more than $66,000 per child, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Tennessee alone experienced a 15-fold increase in babies going through withdrawal from 2002 to 2012. And the numbers have continued to rise.

How to treat these babies has become a matter of urgency among doctors, clinicians, researchers and social workers. Are we failing these newborns? What are we not doing that we should? Can more be done on the front end to prevent the shaking and vomiting?

The University of Tennessee Medical Center sits amid the heart of America's opioid epidemic.

Almost everyone agrees that the nation must tackle this issue with a comprehensive approach. But the opinions on what to do vary. Long-standing guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on detoxification during pregnancy has been this: ""Withdrawal from opioid use during pregnancy is associated with poor neonatal outcomes, including early preterm births or fetal demise, and with higher relapse rates among women.""

At a summit on prescription drug and heroin abuse in Atlanta in April, participants from across the country discussed the increasing number of babies going through withdrawal and how to best care for them and their mothers. Experts stressed the need for better treatment programs for pregnant women, especially in rural America.

Detoxification during pregnancy wasn't considered a viable policy approach at the conference. Some experts said it would be careless -- even reckless. Even if detoxing were medically safe, they said, the risk of relapse was too great, putting newborns in danger as soon as they went home.

Dr. Stephen Patrick of Vanderbilt University said that he likes Towers and admires his work but that there are too many questions.

""My biggest worry about detoxing in pregnancy are rates of relapse,"" says Patrick, assistant professor of pediatrics and health policy at Vanderbilt and an attending neonatologist.

Recent studies have found that women who use opioids have a 40% to 70% rate of relapse, Patrick said.

""I would never say that detoxification may not be the right thing for an individual woman, in the right setting with the right supports,"" Patrick added. ""It's just that overall, I find it worrisome because of relapse rates.""

One couldn't help but wonder: Why would a doctor stake his career on something so risky?

'We can win'

Towers, 62, never expected to be a trailblazer in this field. He'd followed the protocol for nearly four decades: Never detox an expectant mother because of the possibility of ""fetal demise,"" the clinical term for a stillbirth.

But about the time he arrived at the University of Tennessee Medical Center seven years ago, the opioid epidemic hit. Women kept asking why they couldn't detox during pregnancy.

Jessica says that getting clean for her baby is one of the best decisions she's ever made. ""I hope our relationship always stays strong.""

He looked into the research, expecting to confirm everything he'd followed for years. ""To my surprise,"" he says, ""I found it came from two case reports.""

Those two cases in the 1970s set the course for doctors to advise against detoxification. Towers dug further and found that five other, mostly overlooked studies involving about 300 women had been done over a 23-year period beginning in the 1990s. Each indicated that detoxification didn't pose a risk to the fetus.

He embarked on his own study and found detox to be safe. ""Over the last six years, I've detoxed more than 500 women without a loss,"" he says. ""There really is no data in the literature to support that detoxification will kill the baby. Like I said, it came from a propagation of two single case reports in the literature in the 1970s.""

Detoxification, he admits, is not for every woman. His patients have horrific back stories that too often include rape, physical abuse and generational addiction. ""Each case is complicated,"" he says. ""We never coerce anybody or shame them into detox. The patient has to be interested in this. Otherwise, they're not going to succeed.""

Like others, Towers worries about relapse. When he started his detoxification program, the rate of relapse among the participating mothers was more than 70%, compared with 40% and 60% for all people in addiction treatment nationwide.

Four years ago, he hired Katz so women could stay in constant contact with his office throughout their pregnancies and for eight weeks after they leave the hospital. He hopes to increase that supervision time to six months to a year. But already, he says, the rate of relapse since adding the behavioral health component has dropped to around 17%.

Not a single woman has fatally overdosed after going through his program. ""Knock on wood,"" he says.

He gives speeches across the country to spread the news of his research, and he meets with insurance companies in hopes they will pay for it. To deny women who want to get clean the opportunity to do so is wrong, he says, especially as they enter the crucial role of becoming a mother.

""This is a treatable disorder, and we can win,"" he says. ""Hopefully, one of these days, we'll change the protocol for the country. We just have to continue plugging away.""

And shouldn't the medical community try to stop generational addiction in the womb, he wonders, rather than allowing the cycle to continue?

Towers never intended to be a trailblazer, but he says nothing is better than when a patient tells him, ""You saved my life.""

CNN asked to follow one of Towers' patients during the detoxification process. Jessica agreed to share her story, but only in the confines of his office. She didn't want to draw attention in her small town and wanted to protect her son from cameras.

""The main thing I want people to know is to take my testimony of where I was to where I am now,"" she says. ""And maybe if it can help one person make a better decision, then it would be worth it.""

She calls Towers' office a ""godsend"" for getting her on the road to sobriety, something she says she could never do on her own. When she first came to his office, she was taking 8 milligrams a day of Subutex. Some days, she took twice that amount.

She'd been told that her baby would die if she tried to detox, so she was following the maintenance therapy program prescribed to her by the previous clinic. She wept when Towers told her that if she stayed on that level of Subutex, her baby might suffer withdrawal in the weeks following birth.

""I told him I wanted to be off of it, but I just didn't know how to be off of it,"" she says. ""That's what started the whole thing of him helping me.""

Jessica works in an assisted-living community. She likes helping the elderly, speaking with them and hearing their life stories. She's pushed through days of feeling horrible and the terrible loneliness brought on by detoxification.

""It's always that wage of war in your mind -- that you feel so crappy. It's so hard to try and do the right thing,"" she says. ""You have those thoughts of, 'why have I done this?' ""

Her friend Stephanie has talked her off the ledge in moments of desperation. ""When I want to make a stupid decision,"" Jessica says, ""she yells at me.""

""I have a really good support system, but I had to choose to walk away from all the negative people in my life.""

Jessica has lost more than 10 friends to overdoses in recent years -- a stark reminder of the need to stay sober.

Two 'great childhoods' diverged

Jessica and Stephanie met at church 21 years ago. Jessica was 8; Stephanie was 9. Stephanie immediately stole Jessica's Bible, starting their relationship off with a tussle.

But soon, a friendship blossomed. They sang in a choir in their hometown of Morristown and took up leadership positions in church. Through youth group, they went on vacations to places like Destin, Florida, and Dollywood.

Jessica's best friend, Stephanie Moore, has accompanied her to nearly every appointment.

Stephanie, the petite one, often ended up underneath her sleeping friend in the backseat on road trips. ""She was always like that,"" Stephanie says, holding up photographic proof.

Morristown is a picturesque American landscape in the northeastern corner of Tennessee, where the tops of mountains dance with the clouds and where US and Tennessee flags fly on telephone poles along Main Street.

Places like the Timeless Elegance Tea Room occupy space near the Jersey Girl Diner downtown. Steps away, the Village Gunsmith Gun Store anchors a corner. A sign posted along a country road advertises ""Angus bull for sale.""

It was an enjoyable youth. ""We did everything together,"" Stephanie says.

Adds Jessica, ""We really had great childhoods.""

But their lives took disparate paths. When Jessica was 14, her father died, sending her into a spiral. She began hanging out with 30-year-old meth users. Without even realizing it, she had begun an addiction.

Stephanie remembers visiting Jessica's home, watching her zoom around the house with a vacuum cleaner, sweating up a storm, zonked out of her mind. Stephanie opened one of Jessica's makeup kits and found a meth pipe.

""That's when I realized that we're probably not on the same path,"" Stephanie recalls.

They drifted apart in high school. Jessica became unrecognizable. She was manipulative, cunning, deceitful. She pushed away everyone who loved her.

Her mom had always been her rock. But Jessica wrecked that relationship. She had an unplanned pregnancy when she was 20. Her mom has essentially raised the boy. By 22, Jessica's relationship with her mother ""was gone.""

""She was so scared that she was going to get that phone call,"" Jessica says, crying.

Her meth addiction had only grown. She'd take anything she could get her hands on.

Jessica and Stephanie have been friends for 21 years. They hope drugs will never get in the way of their friendship again.

Three years ago, she underwent back surgery and got hooked on opioids at warp speed. She'd go through a month's worth of prescription pills in a week and scramble to feed her habit for the rest of the month. She couldn't hold down a job.

""I couldn't do anything but be strung out, pretty much,"" she says. ""It just grabs a hold of you, and you lose sight of reality -- and before you know it, it's just too late.""

The opioids provided a high like she'd never felt. Like many who get hooked on painkillers, she eventually graduated to heroin, overdosing twice.

""I just wasn't me. You could look at me and see I wasn't there,"" she says. ""They took my life away. They took my soul away.""

She ended up homeless and, at one point, was raped. ""It was just horrible,"" she weeps.

Jessica has worked to repair her relationship with her mother -- something ""that I've missed since I was 16 years old."" Her mother is supportive of the pregnancy and says she's excited for the birth of her granddaughter. ""She's my No. 1,"" says Jessica.

Jessica has restored her relationship with her son. She wears a necklace he gave her; on it hangs an infinity sign and the word ""Mom.""

""I put him through so much, so much. My mom pretty much had to raise him because I couldn't step up.""

She hopes that will never be the case with her daughter.

At one of her son's football practices last summer, she ran into Stephanie. They realized just how much they missed each other. Their old friendship was rekindled.

Jessica was in Stephanie's garden when she learned that she was pregnant. Jessica cried, thinking there was no way she could care for the child. Stephanie, who has a son about the same age as Jessica's, reassured her that the child would be her greatest blessing.

Stephanie accompanied Jessica to the first ultrasound. When the two heard the heartbeat, they knew they couldn't abandon the pregnancy. She and Stephanie would make the journey together. ""I see this baby as mine, too,"" says Stephanie.

Jessica says her addiction wrecked her closest relationships. She's worked to repair her friendship with her mother. ""For so long, I didn't have her, so I felt like I didn't have anyone.""

Stephanie says Towers' work has been transformative: ""I have my best friend back, and I would just like to keep her.""

The two got tattoos on their feet not long after Jessica began her journey to get clean. Their choices reveal the yin and yang of their friendship.

""You keep me safe,"" says Stephanie's tattoo.

And Jessica's: ""You keep me wild.""

'You got to want it, too'

Jessica sits down in a small office with Katz to have a heart-to-heart talk.

The nurse stays in near-constant contact with 80 women in the high-risk unit. They text, email and talk by cell phone at all hours.

""We're not going to judge them for their past,"" she says.

Katz tells each woman about her brother, who died in 2009 from an overdose of methadone and other drugs. He left behind an 18-month-old boy. The pain of that memory still brings tears eight years later. She promised her young nephew that something good would come from his father's death.

Emily Katz has proved to be the key at keeping women on track during detoxification. Rates of relapse have plummeted since she's joined Towers' office.

When she heard that Towers needed help, she knew she had a new purpose in life.

""I treat each one of these girls like they're my sister, like they're my best friend, like they're my daughter,"" she says, ""because we have a common denominator.

""Every day, this is my passion that I get to sit before these girls. I share my testimony, and they get to share theirs. That relationship builds trust more than just nurse to patient. It's more than that.""

Jessica confides that she took 2 milligrams of Subutex the day before. ""I wish I wouldn't have even broke down yesterday, but I just couldn't do it,"" she says.

Katz looks her in the eyes. ""I know, it's hard,"" she says.

Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Prescription and illegal opioids are commonly abused because they are so addictive.



Opioid medications bind to the areas of the brain that control pain and emotions, driving up levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain's reward areas and producing an intense feeling of euphoria.



As the brain becomes used to the feelings, it often takes more and more of the drug to produce the same levels of pain relief and well-being, leading to dependence and, later, addiction. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Oxymorphone hydrochloride – Oxymorphone hydrochloride, under the name Opana ER, was at the center of an HIV outbreak in Indiana in 2015. Some addicts began injecting and shared needles increased the spread of HIV.



In June, the Food and Drug Administration requested that Opana ER manufacturer Endo Pharmaceuticals pull the drug from the market. It was the first time the agency has asked that a opioid pain medication be pulled ""due to the public health consequences of abuse."" Endo announced in July that it would pull the drug. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Codeine – Codeine is one of the weakest opioids, often given when painkillers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen fail to work. Because it decreases activity in the part of the brain that controls coughing, it's frequently mixed with other liquids to develop cough syrups for colds and flu. It has frequently been used for pain relief after removal of tonsils and adenoids in children.



After an investigation, the FDA restricted the use of codeine and tramadol in children under 12 and recommend against their use in children between 12 and 18 years of age. Additionally, the FDA has warned breastfeeding mothers not to take these medications due to the risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Fentanyl – Fentanyl citrate, pictured here, is a Class II controlled substance and one of the most powerful opioids on the market. It's often administered via injection or transdermal patch, or in lozenge form for pain after surgery, for difficult-to-manage chronic pain and for people who have developed a tolerance to other opioids.



The type of fentanyl usually associated with overdoses is bought on the street in powder or pill form and is often mixed with heroin in a clandestine lab to increase the high it produces. Street names include Apache, China girl, goodfella, jackpot, murder 8, TNT and Tango and Cash. Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Hydrocodone – These pills are a more powerful form of codeine, called hydrocodone, and are often mixed with acetaminophen. Hydrocodone is the most frequently prescribed opioid painkiller, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and the most abused. An overdose of hydrocodone can cause ""cold and clammy skin, severely constricted pupils, and slow breathing that can lead to a loss of consciousness and death."" Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Oxycodone – Oxycodone is a powerful narcotic pain reliever prescribed for moderate to high pain relief. It's often given in an extended-release formula for patients who will need to be on pain medications for long periods of time.



Patients are warned not to break, chew, crush or dissolve extended-release tablets because the rush of oxycodone into the system could cause serious health problems, including overdose and death.



Though highly addictive, oxycodone is not thought to be as frequently abused as hydrocodone. OxyContin, Percocet, Percodan and Tylox are some trade-name oxycodone products. Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Morphine – Morphine is another powerful opioid often administered via syringe for severe pain. It can come in pill form, usually as extended-release tablets and capsules, and is prescribed only to relieve difficult, chronic pain that cannot be controlled by the use of other pain medications.



As with most opioids, mixing medications, drinking alcohol or taking other meds that contain alcohol, or using street drugs while taking morphine, increases the risk of breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening side effects. Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Meperidine – Meperidine is another narcotic analgesic, similar to morphine. It's often used to help put people to sleep before an operation and to provide pain relief after childbirth.



The most common brand name is Demerol, which comes in both tablet and liquid forms. It is usually taken with or without food every three or four hours as needed for pain.



As with all opioids, meperidine can cause drowsiness, so never drive a car or operate machinery after taking it until you know how you will react. Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Hydromorphone –

Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Methadone – Though methadone is used to relieve severe chronic pain, it's most commonly known for preventing withdrawal symptoms in patients who were addicted to opioid drugs, as a part of their recovery process.



Methadone has many of the same side effects as other opioids, including weakness, headache, nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, sweating, difficulty urinating, mood changes and vision problems, and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Buprenorphine – Buprenorphine is a opioid used as an alternative to methadone to help addicts recovering from heroin use. Buprenorphine is different from other opioids because it's a ""partial opioid agonist,"" which means that when taken in proper prescribed doses, it should produce less euphoria and physical dependence, and therefore a lower potential for misuse. It's also supposed to have a relatively mild withdrawal profile.



However, if abused by crushing and snorting or injecting, it can suppress breathing and cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death.



Subutex, the brand name for buprenorphine, is taken as a tablet placed under the tongue and allowed to dissolve.



The brand Suboxone is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Antagonists block the opiate receptors in the brain, keeping the narcotic from creating the high abusers crave.

Jessica's boyfriend has been the gatekeeper of her Subutex pills. Katz suggests that the medication be given to Stephanie so she can intervene when Jessica begins to slide and ask her friend, ""What's going on?""

""That also just gives you a little bit more support -- to make sure that person understands what you're going through, that you're trying to taper and that you're trying not to use,"" Katz says.

During those low points, she says, write in a journal about why you're doing this. Keep your daughter in your thoughts at all times.

""You're doing so great. I mean, we're so proud of you. We really are,"" Katz says. ""I could want this all day long for you, girl, but you got to want it, too.""

In a sign of how much she wants to be free from the grips of addiction, Jessica says she hopes that non-opioid painkillers will be used for her C-section. She'd prefer the pain over relapse.

Preparing for birth

Excitement overflows in the labor and delivery room. It's Thursday, April 20. The day has finally come. Accompanying Jessica are her mother, Kathy Hill; Jessica's 31-year-old boyfriend, Jason Smith; and Stephanie.

Jessica has been fully detoxed for 17 days.

Jessica is surrounded by friends, family and hospital staff shortly before her C-section on April 20.

Stephanie braids Jessica's hair to pass the time. They tell the nurse they've been friends for more than 20 years, with major ups and downs. ""It's good now,"" Jessica says.

She hoped to avoid a cesarean section, but in the end, a vaginal birth was not an option. The C-section has been planned for shortly after noon. Jessica can't contain her giddiness. ""I've been picturing what she might look like,"" she says.

""I'm nervous. I'm just ready to see her,"" Jessica says. ""It's been hard, but it's probably one of the best things I've done. For sure.""

There's a chattiness about the room. Jessica debates her mom: What football team should her son play on?

There's paperwork galore to be signed, too.

Katz pops into the room. Jessica greets her with a joke: ""Where's Dr. Towers at? I was about to yell at him if he didn't let you come.""

The two laugh. The night before, they weren't laughing. Consumed by an overwhelming sense of impending motherhood, Jessica freaked out. She called Katz from a different phone than usual. Katz was at dinner and let it ring because she didn't recognize the number. Immediately, a text pinged Katz's phone: ""This is Jessica. Call me.""

Knowing that a fragile state can lead to relapse, Katz stopped what she was doing. ""I can't do this,"" Jessica told her. ""I'm not ready.""

Katz spoke gently and talked her down. She told Jessica that she was ready and that she could do this. It was mostly a fear of the unknown -- a vulnerable expectant mother needing someone to speak with in the moment.

Says Katz: ""I told her, 'You're not going to back out now.' ""

A stream of nurses and medical professionals comes and goes in Jessica's room. She'd hoped that both Stephanie and her boyfriend could both be in the operating room for the delivery. But Towers breaks the bad news: She must choose only one. ""I tried, but there's not enough space,"" he tells her. ""You can be mad at me.""

He encourages her to pick the most supportive person. Smiling, Jessica says, ""If they fight about it too much, then my mom is going.""

Jessica picks her boyfriend, Jason Smith, to be in the delivery room, but she lectures him not to pass out during the birth.

She ultimately chooses her boyfriend, saying she can't deny him the right to see the moment his daughter is born. Soon, Dad-to-be is a ball of nerves. He has to leave the room when her IV is inserted; how's he going to handle when her belly is sliced open?

""You better not pass out,"" Jessica warns.

The nurse tells him a drape will block the view. ""Just sit there and look at her, not to the left or right,"" she advises.

He nods, climbs into Jessica's bed and kisses her. Mom and Stephanie crowd around, and a final selfie is snapped.

At 12:44 p.m., Jessica learns that it's time.

""I'll see you in a minute,"" Towers says. ""You're going to do good.""

Her mom says, ""You got this, honey.""

""Good luck,"" adds Stephanie.

Jessica gets wheeled down the hall to the operating room. On a whiteboard is a message stating today's goal: ""Healthy mom & baby!""

Welcome, Jayda Jewel

Towers paces outside the operating room, dressed in blue scrubs and a surgical cap. He removes his wedding band and ties it around the drawstring on his pants. He tapes his surgical mask to his face so his glasses won't fog up.

Inside, Jessica has been given a spinal tap to numb the pain. Surgical drapes cover Jessica's body, and the room is abuzz with organized chaos.

Nurse Kirby Ginn wheels Jessica toward the operating room.

Katz pauses outside the room. She prays for God to be with Towers and to give Jessica the strength to get through the surgery and for the child to be born healthy. Then she heads into the room.

""You're doing great, Jessica,"" says Dr. Kim Fortner, a member of the medical team. ""We're all right here. It's almost over, OK?""

A look of excruciating pain spreads across Jessica's face.

""Think about her sweet baby cheeks, Jessica,"" says nurse Kirby Ginn.

Moments later, at 1:32 p.m., a beautiful baby girl with chubby cheeks and a patch of brown hair emerges. Jayda Jewel Hill lets out two loud screams.

Towers and his team quickly clean her up and swaddle her in a blanket adorned with teddy bears. She weighs in at 6 pounds and stretches 17 inches.

""Are you ready to see her?"" the nurse asks.

""Yes, ma'am,"" Jessica replies.

Her daughter is placed across her chest. Jessica cradles her with both hands, her right hand patting her back.

""Aww,"" Jessica says.

""She looks great,"" Towers says.

The baby coughs a few times, worrying Jessica.

""Why is she coughing like that?"" she says.

Jayda Jewel Hill was born at 1:32 p.m. April 20. She was born with fluid in her lungs, requiring her to be monitored for much of the evening in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Caught up in the moment, the father seems to miss the question, asking a nurse to take a photo of him with his daughter.

He clutches the swaddled newborn and leans in next to Jessica's face -- the birthing room in the era of social media. ""Hi, little gorgeous. Hi there, beautiful. Look, there's your momma,"" the gleeful father says.

The baby coughs a few more times. ""Is she OK?"" Jessica asks.

Towers explains that the baby sucked in amniotic fluid during surgery. The fluid will be removed from her lungs; it's nothing to be worried about, he assures her.

Katz leans in and holds Jessica's right hand. She tells her to stay strong, that her daughter is healthy. She tells her the baby is going to be taken away to be observed in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Just before stitching Jessica up, Towers uses a non-opioid drug similar to novocaine to dull the pain for 24 hours. Jessica also receives Tylenol IV and an anti-inflammatory drug, Toradol.

""She's hoping to not need any pain pills,"" he says. ""It is major surgery. Your abdomen is open, so it hurts.""

Anything to avoid relapse.

Bucking the trend

Less than 24 hours after the birth, more than 150 doctors, nurse practitioners and other health officials from across East Tennessee gather in an auditorium at the UT medical center.

On stage, Towers steps through a slideshow presentation of opioid use disorder in pregnancy. He reels off stats from the CDC: From 2000 to 2015, more than half a million people died from drug overdoses, including 183,000 people from prescription opioids. ""Unfortunately, we're only getting worse,"" he says.

In Tennessee, he notes, three people die from overdoses every day. He talks about his findings, of the women who've detoxed in his program. ""We're bucking the trend,"" Towers says.

As is tradition, the newborn's footprints were stamped shortly after birth. Jayda Jewel weighed in at 6 pounds and stretched 17 inches.

""I'm passionate because I just believe it's the right way to do medicine,"" he says. ""We don't always succeed. I don't know anyone who succeeds all the time when dealing with addiction. But my passion comes from the ones that we've delivered that don't have (withdrawal) and the look in the mother's eye when they say, 'You saved my life.'

""I don't think you can get any better response from a patient.""

Shortly after the speech, he takes an elevator to the third floor and visits Jessica and her baby. Jessica sports a pink T-shirt that says ""Don't want to be here.""

""We want to be home,"" she says.

Jayda Jewel, nicknamed JJ, looks like the perfect child, with big eyes, content in her mother's arms. She shows no signs of withdrawal, although symptoms can take a couple of days to appear.

Jessica hugs the doctor. ""I couldn't have done this without you and Emily,"" she says.

Outside Towers' presence, Stephanie repeats that sentiment, telling Jessica, ""You're so lucky you got him.""

""If it weren't for this baby, you might not have got off Subutex ever.""

Over the next several days, Jayda Jewel exhibits no signs of withdrawal, but Jessica's pain intensifies. She's given three Vicodin pills, an opioid painkiller. The typical C-section patient gets 10, Towers says.

Jessica had hoped to be given an opioid blocker called Vivitrol, which can resist the urge to use for up to a month. But to get it, her system must be clear of opioids for seven days. Towers expects to be able to give her the medicine in her followup appointment. ""She felt bad about that,"" he says.

The door to Jessica's recovery room celebrates the life of her new daughter. Jayda Jewel, nicknamed JJ, did not suffer withdrawal.

But still, she succeeded. Her baby was born healthy.

Four days after the birth, Jessica straps Jayda Jewel in a car seat in her hospital room and then climbs into a wheelchair to be escorted out of the facility. Mom and daughter head down an elevator and out the front door.

Towers and Katz meet them at their car. Jessica places her baby inside and turns toward them.

""We made it,"" Jessica says, wrapping her arms around her ""Nurse Barbie."" ""I love you.""

""I love you, too,"" Katz responds.

Then Jessica hugs Towers again.

Main Street in Hyannis, the Grant County seat, features a small handful of businesses, including a grocery store, a bank, a restaurant, a bar and a health care clinic that is open only one full day a week.

Hyannis, Nebraska (CNN) -- Deep in the Sandhills of rural Nebraska, where a two-lane highway curves between prairies and grass-covered dunes, there is a county full of surprises.

It's home to Hyannis, a small village without stoplights, where fresh hot coffee is free, everyone waves and, in 1931, a news report named it ""The Richest Town in America.""

Cattle are king and far outnumber people in this county, small children ride horses as comfortably as they walk, and John Wayne's loyal stunt man grew up here, ranching. Roping competitions and pie socials help neighbors in crisis, and people make extra cash selling truckloads of dead coyotes to fur traders.

Life in Grant County, population 641 , could not be more different than the gilded Big Apple existence long enjoyed by President Donald Trump. Still, it ranked among the top counties in the country supporting him in November; he got more than 93% of the votes here. And yet Grant holds another distinction: It's the county with the highest percentage of Obamacare enrollees in the nation.

One in three residents, or 33% of the under-65 population, bought insurance on Obamacare exchanges, official data from a year ago show. The national average is just 5%, which raises the question: In a place so tied to the Affordable Care Act, why would people back the man who vowed to repeal it? Wouldn't that seem a vote against the community's own interests?

""People may think we're slow,"" explains one man, ""but we're not stupid.""

In their world, one they feel is overlooked by those in big cities or on the coasts, their actions make perfect sense. You can't possibly understand, they say, unless you've lived here. I set out to try.

Breaking the news

Just mention politics to a group of men unwinding over gas station coffee and the insults come fast and fierce, political correctness be damned.

""The black bomb"" is how one rancher describes Trump's predecessor. ""This guy came out of the sewers of Chicago. How could he be good?""

The rancher's not about to give his name to someone with the ""Clinton News Network"" -- what he calls CNN -- but he and his friends are happy to rail against the former administration. Obamacare is right up there on the list of things gone wrong, they say.

The hands they extend for shakes are rough and callused, symbols of how hard people here work. They are self-sufficient and don't like being told what to do any more than they like taking handouts. They take care of themselves, and each other, and don't need government stepping in to muck things up.

That their county leads the nation in Obamacare enrollees is news to everyone I meet.

""If they're on it, they're not saying,"" one man theorizes. People are on it only because the government ""put a gun to people's heads,"" offers another. And just because they're on it, they warn, doesn't mean they like it.

No other choice

Walking through Hyannis, the county seat, I hear stories of skyrocketing premiums, deductibles that can't be met and brewing resentment. If people don't want to pay the penalty for not having insurance, which is taken out of the tax refunds they rely on, they're trapped.

What they tell me might give pause to Obamacare experts, who say the Affordable Care Act is complicated, is hard to navigate and often leaves people misinformed about costs and choices. But these are the experiences and perceptions of how the law has played out in Grant County.

Why some Nebraskans hate Obamacare Less choice. Higher premiums. Ideological opposition. These are some of the reasons so many rural Nebraskans may not be happy with their insurance under Obamacare. But there's also evidence the Affordable Care Act has helped rural communities like Grant County -- gains that could be erased with a repeal. READ MORE

Some have appreciated newfound coverage: With it, they were able to take care of longstanding problems, like the woman with a prolapsing uterus who could finally have a hysterectomy. But most people I meet complain that they're on Obamacare only because they have no other choice.

Unless they work for the school, the county, the railroad or the electric company -- and the vast majority of people in cattle country don't -- these aren't Americans fortunate to be covered by an employer's insurance plan.

Some might have been so lucky in the past, but that luck ran out when the Affordable Care Act came in, they say.

Ginger Fouse curates the Grant County museum in the county courthouse. She's rushing to make a doctor's appointment in Alliance, 60 miles away and home to the closest hospital. Before she goes, she makes her feelings about Obamacare clear: ""Nothing but horseshit.""

Fouse's husband is a ranch hand, and they used to get coverage through the ranch. But once Obamacare hit the scene, she says, the rancher believed everyone could take care of themselves. Only problem is, Fouse says, she and her husband can no longer afford the premiums. So they're now covered by nothing.

""We're not going to quit eating to pay insurance,"" she says before heading out the door.

Ellen White, a museum volunteer, steps in to introduce me to the area she's always called home.

She shows off aged photographs: the old town hall where they used to dance, images from the 1949 blizzard that wiped out cattle and snapshots from the first old-timer rodeo.

Ellen White, 69, volunteers at the county museum and speaks proudly of the history and work ethic that shaped her and others. ""We've gotten along in this world without anyone telling us what to do,"" she says.

A man's barbed-wire collection is on display, as is memorabilia from the deceased military doctor who delivered White and countless other locals.

The highlight, though, is a collection of keepsakes from the late Chuck Hayward, who took his horses to Hollywood and worked as John Wayne's stuntman. Included are action shots, the saddle Hayward used while filming in Afghanistan and wooden stirrups from a shoot in Chile. There's also a saddle said to have been used by Wayne himself during the filming of ""True Grit.""

White, 69, describes a time she wishes younger generations would appreciate. She grew up on a ranch south of Ashby, an unincorporated community just west of Hyannis. She, like so many others, rode a horse to her country school.

She had three older brothers, and if they told her she couldn't do something, she proved she could. She was able to drive a team of horses by age 5 and helped milk 12 to 15 cows every morning and night.

Life was tough, but it made people who they are. They worked for everything they had.

Sometimes she watches HGTV and is stunned by house hunters shopping for $500,000 homes.

""They'll pay on those houses forever and ever,"" she says. ""We didn't buy anything unless you could pay cash for it.""

It's that sort of responsibility and practicality that courses through this ranching community's veins.

Assessing life here

Roughly 150 ranches dot the county, most of them passed down through families. It's an area where the first homesteaders arrived in the 1880s, tried to farm and failed. The sandy soil worked against them but proved a sweet spot for cattlemen, who snatched up tracts of land.

The ranches are private and sit far off the main roads, in some cases miles off, and are impossible to assess by driving past. Ask a rancher about the size of his land or his herd, and he'll keep those numbers to himself.

The question is uncouth, explains Dan Vinton, a lifetime rancher and longtime county commissioner; it's like prying into a person's salary.

""We have enough grass to feed the cows,"" says Vinton, 66. ""We have enough cows to take care of the grass.""

Dan Vinton, a lifetime rancher and longtime county commissioner, knows that this life isn't for everyone. ""It's pretty hard for the city person to adjust to the country lifestyle,"" he says. ""You can't just jump into your car and go to Walmart.""

Over chicken-fried steak in the Hyannis Hotel Restaurant, one of a handful of businesses on Main Street, Vinton and fellow Commissioner Tom White -- who worked in the feed business and is married to Ellen, the museum volunteer -- regale me with their own stories of growing up in Grant County.

They didn't have electricity till the 1950s, got up and went to sleep along with the sun and like to say they ""had running water because you had to run and get it."" They took Saturday night baths in the same water used by their siblings.

""We didn't know we were stinky little buggers because we all smelled the same,"" White, 71, says with a laugh.

Life here has always made sense to them, no matter the challenges. When White needed chemo and radiation to treat cancer a couple months back, he and his wife simply rented an apartment near the hospital in Scottsbluff, more than 100 miles away, for five weeks. They'll travel to Denver for his upcoming surgery.

They aren't city folk and don't want to be. Vinton drives that point home when he admits he and his wife have cell phones only so they can find each other when they get separated in the Walmart, which is well over an hour from home.

Vinton's son works at the family ranch and is on Obamacare. His folks and the Whites aren't on it themselves, but they look forward to the day when it's abolished. They hear people complain about rates rising and call the program ""ridiculous.""

Not wanting to be dependent

A 31-year-old woman sits in the restaurant beside her towheaded boy. To her, Obamacare is maddening, and she unleashes her frustration.

She's a college grad who does her research. When she and her husband got married, they picked out a policy and were happy. But then, Obamacare changed everything.

They could no longer afford the private plan they liked. The number of companies she could choose from on the Obamacare exchange dwindled; only two choices exist today. They switched to one company only to see it get absorbed by another. They watched their premiums and deductibles increase, along with out-of-pocket expenses. They've been on four plans in two years.

She's married to a rancher, and in ranching, it's hard to estimate how much a person will earn each year. When cows sell high, ranchers do well. But, as in any market, the numbers fluctuate. One year, her family might make $20,000; another $50,000, she says. Financial uncertainty makes planning a crapshoot.

A stunning thing happened, though, when she got pregnant with her son. Suddenly, she was told she qualified for Medicaid, a notion that made her Republican head spin.

""I want to be responsible for myself. I don't want to be dependent,"" says the woman, who didn't want her name used. ""But you priced me out of what I did to take care of myself and forced me into government assistance.""

Pregnancies only last so long, though, and she doesn't meet the Nebraska Medicaid qualifications for parents. That means she's back to fretting about what this year's premiums will be.

""I have to get knocked up,"" she says, half joking, half disgusted. ""Mama needs dental care.""

Fans turned foes

Across the street in the grocery store, I spot Clarissa ""Casey"" Sanchez working behind the counter. She was a fan of Obamacare at first.

Paying $50 a month for herself was both doable and a source of comfort for the 30-year-old employee.

But then she got married. With their combined gross incomes, she says, her monthly premium jumped to more than $600, and they make too much to qualify for Medicaid. Her husband has his own private policy, but she says she can't join it because she's pregnant. He bought the low-premium policy before Obamacare, and it doesn't include maternity coverage.

Sanchez is determined to take care of herself but feels punished for trying. She's 13 weeks pregnant, scared and crossing her fingers.

""I'm going without insurance and hope Trump does something quick,"" she tells me.

Nearby, working at a cash register, Julie Braun, 36, chimes in: ""I got married to get off Obamacare.""

Julie Braun, 36, says she was so disappointed in Obamacare that she got married to get off it.

She, too, once enjoyed low premiums -- just $30 a month -- only to see them soar. She needed two ankle surgeries last year, and with a high deductible, copays, therapies, braces and boots -- which aren't covered -- she says she's staring down a $20,000 bill she can't pay. She makes $9 an hour and even with her husband's salary plans to file for medical bankruptcy.

Though Braun and her husband had intended to marry at some point, they moved up their wedding date by a couple years. He teaches in the school and has good benefits, and that was all she needed to rush down the aisle.

'A scam and racket'

People here say they've had it with Washington and ""mealy-mouthed politicians,"" the sort who speak pretty but say nothing, one local explains. This is why they backed Trump en masse. They like that he has a business record and trust that he can do better by them.

""The man didn't get rich as he is by being stupid,"" says one man who refuses to give his name but pulls me aside to tell his own story.

He's 50 and has never paid for health insurance. He calls the health care system ""a scam and a racket."" When he had a cracked tooth not long ago -- the first dental problem he'd ever had -- the dentist told him it would cost more than $4,000 to fix. ""For one tooth!"" he exclaims.

So he looked at the dentist and asked how much it would cost to pull out all his teeth and give him fake ones instead. It was half the price, so he came back with his checkbook and had every tooth yanked.

He now says he's facing a stiff penalty for not having insurance, which enrages him.

""I pay for my own medical, and now I have to pay for someone else's?"" he says. ""Don't get me wrong; I want to do my part. But when does my part stop?""

'Garden of Eden'

The Sandhills Oil Company gas station -- just ""the station"" to locals -- is a popular gathering spot where people gab over coffee.

Robin Jameson, 56, sits in the corner office. She moved here to oversee the station, one of several in a family business portfolio.

""It felt like home immediately,"" she says. She likes how people watch out for one another, donating propane and groceries to those in need, and she gives back in her own way.

An old rancher strolls into her office, seeking help deciphering a credit card bill. Retired ranchers down the road visit whenever their grandson competes in out-of-town rodeos, so she can set them up on a computer to watch the live-stream.

Woody Thompson sits in the station and over coffee talks about his ""Garden of Eden.""

One of the regulars at a station table is Woody Thompson, 76. He landed in this area more than 60 years ago, when he came out of the Dust Bowl looking for work. He says he was brought here by ""a drunk and a horse thief.""

For decades, he worked on ranches. It's been a life rich in independence and great neighbors, the sort who once kept reselling a white leghorn rooster to raise money for a friend dying of brain cancer. These qualities made even the toughest days worthwhile. Digging harnesses out of snow drifts, riding miles and miles in 30-below temperatures, the winter of '78-'79 when the ground never saw less than 3 feet of snow -- he wouldn't take back his time here for anything.

""It might not be heaven, but it's the Garden of Eden,"" Thompson says.

A heart problem eventually took him away from ranching. Twice a month, he drives 70 miles south to see his Denver cardiologist, who meets him in Ogallala -- the nearest town on the nearest interstate. (Locals like that the interstate runs through flat Nebraska, allowing them to keep their hills to themselves.)

Thompson, who moved to Hyannis 15 years ago, hands over one of his business cards. He's now a traveling rep for a company that performs castrations. With a couple golf balls in a bag, he demonstrates how they're done.

Like so many people in this county, he says that Trump's business know-how spoke to him -- even if he doesn't suspect that he'd like the guy personally.

""I have three daughters,"" Thompson says. ""If Megyn Kelly had been my daughter, I would have beat the hell out of him.""

Respecting the law

A couple blocks uphill, in the old courthouse, I find Christee Haney. She's in her second term as county clerk and keeps official records in the same books and logs used by clerks in the late 1800s.

When she was elected seven years ago, it was to fill multiple offices. In an area as rural as this, she's more than the country clerk. She's also the county assessor, the registrar of deeds, the clerk of the court and the election commissioner.

Party registration doesn't dictate votes here, where 81% of registered voters cast ballots in November. She has 40 registered Democrats, she says, but only 20 people voted for Hillary Clinton. Haney's cousin is one example; she's a Democrat who voted for Trump and refused to back Obama, whom she never trusted.

Haney, 54, considers the high rate of Obamacare enrollment in Grant County and offers this: People are abiding by the law, simple as that.

""It's a matter of respect out here, and that's what we've all taught our kids,"" she says.

Christee Haney, the Grant County clerk and more, writes in the same logs used in the late 1800s.

The K-12 school in Hyannis, which serves several counties and has fewer than 150 students, is a source of pride here. The teacher-to-student ratio is 1-to-9, the principal tells me. Students are more than cowboys and cowgirls: They test above the national average, are given their own laptops, flourish in the arts and play sports that draw the community together.

Parents who've raised kids here brag about them getting scholarships; one proud dad says his daughter turned down Stanford, MIT and Yale because she wanted to be a Cornhusker. She graduated from the University of Nebraska with perfect grades.

People here may not have what big cities offer, but that suits them. When Haney takes a day to run errands in Ogallala, population 4,570 , she finds the traffic and all the people exhausting.

She and others here prefer this quiet life with wide-open spaces and fewer stresses. They aren't facing a drug epidemic and don't worry about crime. They leave their keys in the ignition and don't lock their doors. They don't have a homeless problem and don't fret about unemployment. If anyone wants to work, there's work to be had.

The folks in Grant County wish people elsewhere would take responsibility in their own lives and stop blaming others for their problems.

""People on welfare in big cities make more money not working than we do working,"" says one woman. She's not the only one I meet who believes this.

Not wanting to go without

In a small house on the north side of the tracks, where the railroad carries coal from Wyoming and Montana, Terry Keys feeds and burps his 3-month-old son, Deacon.

The baby shouldn't be this old. He was born two months early, when severe preeclampsia sent Terry, 34, and his wife, Trish, on an emergency trip to Lincoln at the end of October. Trish and Deacon had to stay there for a month until it was safe to bring the baby home. Terry, who helps drill and service wells, drove more than 300 miles each way to join them on weekends.

Trish, the village's 37-year-old salon owner, curls up in the chair beside her husband and son and recounts an odyssey she's still processing.

The couple, both Trump supporters, had been uninsured when Obamacare came along. The first year, they paid a penalty of $90. But fearing the prospect of steeper fines, they signed up. With the Affordable Care Act, they could purchase what had previously evaded them for about $150 a month.

""It was reasonable, and we didn't have insurance before,"" Trish says. It helped them, she says, until it didn't.

Trish Keys, with 3-month-old Deacon, is fighting to untangle how she ended up with a $104,000 medical bill for her son, who was born two months early.

She'd been told their policy would cover Deacon and the exorbitant neonatal intensive care expenses for the first 30 days of his life ""no matter what."" But she says the insurance company stopped the family's policy without notice. Trish and Terry found out only when they stepped into a pharmacy in Lincoln for flu shots and were told they had no coverage.

A panicked phone call later, she was told they qualified for Medicaid and should apply, which meant a flurry of paperwork and bureaucracy. After the trauma of having a preemie and being stuck in a city far from the world she knows, Trish came home to the stress of fighting a $104,000 bill. She still isn't sure who's responsible -- Medicaid or the insurance company -- and only knows she and Terry won't be able to pay it.

""There has to be a simpler way. I feel like they've overcomplicated everything,"" she says.

""It's mind-boggling to me,"" she says before turning her gaze to her son, who finally weighs 9 pounds. ""Now that this has happened, you don't want to go without insurance.""

She hopes to still be able to afford it. And like others in this remote heartland county, she trusts that her new president won't let her down.",2017-01-24 00:00:00
The four reasons people commit hate crimes,"(CNN) What motivated the man who killed two people on a Portland train after shouting anti-Muslim slurs?

What prompted the person, or people, who spray-painted the N-word on an NBA star's home

What ideas would incite an Israeli teen charged with threatening dozens of Jewish centers in the US, throwing communities into chaos and terrifying the parents of young children?

We call them all ""hate crimes,"" as if the same motivation lurks behind each of these disparate incidents. But that term is outdated and inaccurate, experts say.

What spurs offenders into action is rarely animosity alone. It's a toxic mix of emotions, from anger to fear to indignation. And, as the FBI says , ""hate itself is not a crime."" Instead, bias is considered an ""added element"" to offenses like murder, arson and vandalism, leading at times to longer prison sentences.

The public and prosecutors often disagree on what constitutes a hate crime. Besieged minorities like Muslims and transgender people often see an assault on one of them as an attack on their entire community, especially in this era of intense rancor and fear. Between the November election and February, for instance, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted more than 1,300 ""hate incidents"" across the country.

But how do prosecutors determine the role hate had in a given crime? For more than two decades, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have relied on a somewhat obscure study to help spot bias in criminal offenses.

In 1993, Jack McDevitt and Jack Levin, two social scientists in Boston, examined 169 hate-crime case files at the Boston Police Department. They then interviewed victims, offenders and investigators. McDevitt and Levin found that there are four main kinds of hate crimes, ranging from thrill-seekers, the most common; to ""mission-offenders,"" the rare but often lethal hardcore hatemongers.

Knowing the differences between the types of hate crimes -- and their motivations -- not only helps law enforcement better understand them, McDevitt said, it also helps find perpetrators and put them in prison. ""If they know the motivation,"" he told CNN, ""they know where to look.""

Here are the four categories of hate-crimes, along with some examples, many of which are hypotheticals taken from the FBI's training manual on recognizing and collecting data on hate crimes:

Thrill-seeking

These hate crimes are often driven by an immature itch for excitement and drama. Think bored and drunk young men marauding through neighborhoods, mayhem on their minds.

Often there is no real reason for these crimes, experts say. They're committed for the thrill of it, and the victims are vulnerable simply because their sexual, racial, ethnic, gender or religious background differs from that of their attackers.

Often the attackers think society doesn't care about the victims -- or worse, will applaud their assault.

The attackers may be young, but they are dangerous. In McDevitt's study, 70% of these ""thrill offenses"" were assaults, including vicious beatings that put victims in the hospital.

That said, the attackers' animosity toward their victims, who are chosen at random, can be relatively low, which at least offers the opportunity for rehabilitation.

Examples: A group of teens breaks into an LGBT center, destroys property and scrawls anti-gay graffiti on the walls. A street gang assaults a Hindu man while yelling anti-Hindu epithets. A group of men viciously attack men leaving a well-known gay bar, yelling ""Sissy!"" and ""Girlie-man!""

Defensive

In these hate crimes, the attackers sees themselves as ""defending"" their turf: their neighborhood, their workplace, their religion or their country.

Unlike thrill-seekers, who invade other neighborhoods and attack without warning, ""defenders"" target specific victims and justify their crimes as necessary to keep threats at bay. Many times, they are triggered by a particular event, such as a Muslim or black family moving into a new neighborhood.

Like thrill-seekers, the ""defenders"" show little or no remorse for their attacks and believe that most, if not all of society supports them but is too afraid to act.

""They honestly believe that what they're doing has some sort of communal assent,"" said Brian Levin, who leads the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.

Examples: A group home for people with psychiatric disabilities is set on fire by a man heard to say, ""I'll get rid of those crazies."" A transgender woman is attacked near her home by men who yell, ""We don't want no queers in this neighborhood!"" A Japanese man is attacked by a white man who called him an anti-Asian epithet and complained that the Japanese are taking jobs away from Americans.

Retaliatory

These hate crimes are often seen as revenge, whether in response to personal slights, other hate crimes or terrorism.

The ""avengers,"" who often act alone, target members of the racial, ethnic or religious group who they believe committed the original crime -- even if the victims had nothing to do with it. They care only about revenge, and they will travel to the victims' territory to enact it.

These eye-for-an-eye attacks spike after acts of terrorism, a bitter backlash that often targets Muslim Americans. After the 9/11 attacks, for example, hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims rose by 1,600%. A similar spike occurred after the Paris attacks in 2015.

Occasionally, members of the same religion or racial group target each other.

Ohio prosecutors, for example, charged members of a breakaway Amish sect with hate crimes after they violently cut off the beards of a rival sect. An appeals court overturned the hate crimes conviction, though, ruling that religion had been a significant but not prime motivation behind the assaults.

Examples: A woman fires gun shots into the men's locker room of a fitness center, saying she hates men for rejecting her. Hours after Islamic extremists launch a terrorist attack in Europe, someone defaces an American mosque with graffiti that says ""Go home, terrorists!""

Mission offenders

These are the deadliest -- and rarest -- types of hate crimes. They are committed by people who consider themselves ""crusaders,"" often for a racial or religious cause. Their mission: total war against members of a rival race or religion. They are often linked to groups that share their racist views.

Mission offenders write lengthy manifestos explaining their views, visit websites steeped in hate speech and violent imagery, and travel to target symbolically significant sites while seeking to maximize carnage.

""Mission offenders believe that the system is rigged against them, which means that they can justify excessive violence against innocents,"" said Levin.

These hate crimes can look a lot like terrorism, and scholars say mission offenses often overlap both definitions, as in the case of a Muslim man who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last year. Former President Barack Obama called the massacre both ""an act of terror and an act of hate.""

Examples: Mission offenders tend to become infamous. According to criminologists, they include Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, Charleston church shooter Dylan Roof and Omar Mateen, who massacred 49 people at gay nightclub in Orlando.

What can be done?

McDevitt acknowledges limits to these categories. Crimes rarely fit cleanly into one or the other. ""Some people have multiple motivations. They may feel 'defensive,' but also that it's fun to go and harass someone.""

Edward Dunbar, a psychologist who has written widely about hate crimes, said the categories are valuable for training police and prosecutors but can't predict or prevent bias-motivated attacks.

""To assess patterns of violence, or look at issues like capacity to benefit from rehabilitation, or to consider the evidence of premeditation, the typology is not the way to go.""

Still, the categories help communities learn how to respond to hate crimes, McDevitt and other experts say.

Many hate-crime offenders believe that society supports their violent prejudices. The Internet, with its hives of hate groups, has fed that feeling, especially with the ascendancy of the alt-right during the 2016 presidential election.

It's crucial for communities -- and politicians -- to clearly and unequivocally condemn hate crimes. McDevitt said that when he interviewed victims, they tended to want three things:

1) A statement from public officials denouncing the crime and the beliefs that inspired it.

2) For law officers to take the crime -- and their duty to protect the vulnerable -- seriously.

3) For communities to value them and make clear they don't share the animosity that triggered the hate crimes.

In other words, behind every hate crime is a message: You are not welcome here.

Behind every strong community is another: Yes, you are.",2017-06-02 00:00:00
Understanding why a visa can be so coveted and reviled,"(CNN) I did not arrive in America as a refugee or to join family already here. I owe the start to my life in this country to two things: my father's brilliant mind and a very special document.

Daddy was a statistician renowned in his field of probability theory, and in 1975, Florida State University offered him a teaching position. We flew across the globe on Indian passports and gained entry into America with a visa called H-1, reserved for people such as my father who possessed distinctive skills.

We later applied for permanent residency, my father went on to become a professor emeritus at FSU and in 2008, I proudly became a US citizen

The H-1 visa was designed to attract smart people who were considered the best and the brightest of global talent to fill the gaps in the US workforce. I am a direct beneficiary of that program. Without it, my own trajectory would have been very different.

In 1990, the visa was reinvented as H-1B, and it boomed alongside the rise of Silicon Valley. Most H-1Bs are awarded to technology workers, though other fields such as science and medicine also benefit. And these days, almost 70% of the visas are awarded to Indian nationals.

Without the H-1B program, argue its supporters, innovation is sure to suffer and America stands to lose its competitive edge. Look at any number of start-ups, and you're sure to find talented folks who reached America on an H-1B. Among that elite group is Mike Krieger , one of the founders of Instagram.

But in recent years, abuses and fraud in America's largest guest worker program have surfaced. And now with Donald Trump in the White House, H-1B is facing fresh scrutiny.

In April, Trump signed a ""Buy American and Hire American"" executive order that is part of his ambitious plan to restore 25 million American jobs. The President blames H-1B visa holders for stealing US jobs, and his order takes aim at the program. The visas, he said, ""should never, ever be used to replace Americans.""

The criticism fits neatly into prevailing anti-immigrant rhetoric, even though H-1Bs are not for immigrants. And to be clear, many H-1B opponents say they don't support building walls or taking other measures to keep foreigners out.

I read Trump's harsh words and wondered: How could a visa responsible for my own family's success come under so much fire? When did a perfectly legitimate guest worker system become so controversial? Who wins? Who loses? Has it really become bad for America?

Intrigued, I decided to learn more about the H-1B visa.

My conversations led me to other Indian Americans, and some of their comments surprised me. I reached out to a congressman from Silicon Valley, a CEO of a tech company who refuses to hire H-1B workers, and a technology worker who lost a fulfilling job and is running for Congress to change the system. I even spoke with an H-1B worker from my native India whose story I found heartbreaking.

I learned there were no simple answers to my questions. What I do know is the H-1B visa has become a document coveted by thousands around the globe -- and reviled by just as many in the United States.

A losing lottery?

To understand how the H-1B visa system works, I called one of the nation's foremost experts on the subject: Ronil Hira.

Hira, an associate professor of public policy at Howard University, t estified last year before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the impact of H-1B workers. He began with his personal story, one that is not unlike mine.

He was the son of immigrants who left India in the 1950s to seek a better life. His wife's family also arrived in the United States on the same H-1 visa program as my father.

The idea behind H-1B is the same as it was when my father obtained his H-1. It's still employer-sponsored and temporary -- the H-1B is good for three years and is extendable for another three. After that, the holder has to return home unless the employer sponsors him or her for permanent residency -- better known as a green card.

Each year, US Citizenship and Immigration Services issues 65,000 H-1B visas to applicants with bachelor's degrees for ""specialty occupations."" Another 20,000 are set aside for those with master's degrees or higher from a US university.

JUST WATCHED H-1B visas by the numbers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH H-1B visas by the numbers 01:16

Those caps, mandated by Congress, were as high as 195,000 in the early 2000s, and many in the tech industry would like to see them rise again.

""The single stupidest policy in the entire American political system was the limit on H-1B visas,"" Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, recently told an MIT audience. ""A properly run company is really about having the best people.""

The demand for the visas remains high and the competition, intense.

This year, on the morning of April 1, the first-come, first-served application process opened like the gates to a horse race. Four days later, it was over. The USCIS had received 199,000 visa petitions from employers -- way more than enough to meet the statutory caps.

Because of the high number of applications, the visas are then allotted by lottery.

That's where the trouble begins. If the intent is to get the highest-skilled workers to fill ""specialty occupations,"" why is the government using an arbitrary method such as the lottery? Although everyone in the lottery is theoretically qualified, chances are some better-qualified applicants will lose out to those with less skill and experience.

Another problem: Employers are supposed to seek a foreign worker only when they cannot find a qualified American for the job. But that's not how it works, Hira tells me.

Large firms unfairly snag a chunk of H-1B visas by flooding the application pool. They include familiar names such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, but the biggest recipients are outsourcing companies like Cognizant and Accenture and Indian giants Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, the two top recipients of H-1B visas.

Employers must make a good-faith effort to recruit an American worker for a position before seeking an H-1B visa, but they don't have to document their efforts.

""The actual rules don't require companies to look for American workers and specialized skills,"" Hira says. ""The definitions have gotten loose. Everything in the system is written in favor of the employers.""

The big companies have figured out how to play the visa game and take advantage of loopholes, Hira says. And the smaller companies, the ones that are more in need of specialized labor, are often out of luck.

The main reason American companies hire H-1B workers through outsourcing firms, Hira says, is to save money. A whole lot of it.

Employers are suppopesed to pay H-1B workers a ""prevailing wage"" based on the job and location. But Hira's research found that employers were recruiting H-1B labor at entry-level wages, not the average wage for specific jobs.

Infosys or Tata can save a company up to $45,000 per worker every year, according to Hira's analysis.

In 2013, for instance, Infosys snared almost 7,000 H-1B visas. The median wage it paid was $70,882, about $20,000 lower than a computer systems analyst in Rosemead, California. That's the home of Southern California Edison, a utility that replaced more than 300 American IT workers with H-1B workers employed by Infosys. Hira cites a compensation study that showed Edison IT specialists were earning an average annual base pay of $110,446.

The lower salaries at Infosys and other outsourcing firms are still attractive to thousands of tech workers in India, who average only $6,000 a year and clamor for an opportunity to work in the United States.

Neeraj Gupta came from India to America as a graduate student and then was hired on an H-1B by a Silicon Valley firm, which later sponsored his green card. Gupta went on to found his own tech company, which was ultimately acquired by an Indian outsourcing firm.

In 2009, after witnessing the offshoring of jobs, Gupta began looking into solutions that would create American jobs in technology services.

""With respect to President Trump, there is truth in what he is saying,"" Gupta tells me. ""The premise of the visa is accurate. The challenge is how it has been hijacked by the IT outsourcing industry.""

Hira, too, believes the good intent of H-1B has been overrun by corporations that cannot see beyond their profit margins.

He was in favor of H-1B, he told the Senate committee last year. But it was imperative to fix a broken system.

""High-skilled immigration has directly benefited my family enormously,"" Hira told lawmakers. Then, he issued this warning:

""Thousands of American jobs will be offshored. Tens of thousands of American workers will have their wages depressed. And thousands of American students will be denied opportunities. That's one lottery American workers and students are guaranteed to lose.""

Laid off and forced to train his replacement

Craig Diangelo lost big to H-1B.

At first, he kept quiet, in line with an agreement he signed to not disparage his employer. But he was so incensed by the injustice at his workplace he could not stay silent.

Not only did Diangelo, 65, lose his job to a less-skilled, lower-paid foreign worker, but he was forced to train his replacement or face losing his severance.

Craig Diangelo lost his job at Northeast Utilities and had to train his replacement, an H-1B worker.

He'd worked in information technology all his life, but the sudden job loss dimmed his future considerably. So much so, that Diangelo is now running for office.

Frustrated by the inaction of lawmakers to reform America's guest worker program, Diangelo is running as a Republican to unseat Democrat Elizabeth Esty in Connecticut's 5th Congressional District.

""I would like the law to change,"" Diangelo says. ""You cannot bring over an H-1B worker to replace an American.""

Diangelo had always wanted to be a schoolteacher, but after finishing his degree in education in the mid-1970s he couldn't find a job. Instead he went to work for Travelers Insurance Cos. in Hartford, Connecticut.

He began as a COBOL programmer, and his career evolved over the decades as the tech industry changed. In his last full-time position at Northeast Utilities in Berlin, Connecticut, Diangelo helped support the company's storage architecture. He made $130,000 a year.

""It was a wonderful job,"" he tells me. ""It paid me well. I worked with a great group of people.""

That began unraveling when a merger with a smaller company led to changes in management. In October 2013, the new managers gathered the 220 employees in Diangelo's unit and bluntly announced that their jobs were going to Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services.

""Why were we not given the first rights to re-apply for our jobs?"" Diangelo says. ""Why was I not given the opportunity to go to Infosys and say: 'I would like to apply for this position?' ""

To make matters worse, Diangelo was told he would have to engage in ""knowledge transfer"" and train his Indian replacement.

""I was in complete disbelief,"" he says. ""I gave my soul to this company. They had been good to me. It didn't make any sense.""

He was told his last day would be in December, but that was extended to March and then to May when his employers realized the replacement workers were not ready. They were not high-skilled employees filling a job for which no Americans were available, as was the intent of H-1B.

""They were lower-skilled workers,"" Diangelo says. ""We had to train them from scratch. My replacement was making half of what I was making. And he had no benefits.""

I'd met Infosys employees when I visited the company's shiny Googlesque campus in Bangalore, India, several years ago. They told me how IT jobs had opened up opportunities, changed their lives. For the first time in generations, their families aspired to so much more in life.

Tech companies are a point of pride in my homeland. The industry is the largest private sector employer in India and constitutes about 10% of the gross domestic product. Technology is a big reason why India arrived as a major player on the global stage.

I knew there was a mad rush to apply for H-1B visas at Infosys and other outsourcing firms. But what I did not realize is that these eager Indians were putting Americans out of work.

From Diangelo, I was hearing the ugly side of Indian tech.

Northeast Utilities employees put up US flags in cubicles after realizing they would lose their jobs to H-1B workers.

I contacted Infosys and Tata for comment. Tata did not respond. An Infosys spokesman told me the company was not granting any interviews regarding H-1B visas. He did, however, send me this statement:

""We continue to invest in the local communities in which we operate, including hiring local American top talent, bringing education and training to our clients to shrink the skills gap in the US, and working with policymakers to foster innovation within states and across the country. It is our endeavor to help clients leverage the best US talent together with the best global talent.""

Diangelo says he found it humiliating, depressing even, that he had to stay on -- with his Infosys replacement -- at a job he knew would soon vanish for him. But he and his colleagues were older workers close to the top of their salary grades. He knew it would be hard to find employment elsewhere. He had few options.

Diangelo trained his replacement in Connecticut as well as 11 other workers in India. The company, he says, recorded his webinars, and he guesses his training sessions have been used many times since his departure.

This is how it sometimes works: Indian H-1B workers are brought in to replace workers here in America, but subsequently many of the jobs are moved offshore to India.

Diangelo and his colleagues on the second floor of the Northeast Utilities building put up small US flags on their cubicles. As each completed a last day at work, a flag came down. Diangelo was the last. When he returned after a weekend to turn in his company badge, only his flag remained. Then, that, too, was gone.

I asked for an interview with a manager at Northeast Utilities, now called Eversource Energy, and was sent a statement via e-mail:

""Three years ago we made strategic changes to our IT department to support the merger of two companies and keep pace with changing technologies to better serve our customers,"" the statement read. ""As an electric and gas delivery business, we did not have the internal capabilities to efficiently meet the growing technology needs of the larger, combined company.""

Eversource, said the statement, uses Infosys and Tata to perform some of its IT functions, and that employees such as Diangelo who were affected were offered comprehensive severance packages, career transition and training services and extended health care coverage.

This has nothing to do with immigration. We have a bill out there that allows foreign workers to take American jobs. Craig Diangelo

Eversource is hardly the only US entity that has been accused of laying off Americans in favor of cheaper Indian labor.

Employees at the University of California, San Francisco, had to train their replacements from an outsourcing firm. So did technology workers at Walt Disney World, New York Life, Toys R Us and Southern California Edison.

And these are just the cases that have surfaced publicly because of lawsuits and employees such as Diangelo who risked losing their severance by speaking out.

Diangelo says he holds nothing against his replacement worker from Infosys, nothing against immigrants. He blames the system that allows this to happen.

This year, he watched as the H-1B application date of April 1 approached. He had counted on Trump to put a moratorium on the visas. But now, he says, 85,000 more foreign workers will arrive in the United States in the coming months.

""That means another 85,000 Americans will lose their jobs,"" he says.

""Every time I talk to my senators and congressmen, they say we need a comprehensive immigration bill,"" he says. ""But these are two separate things. This has nothing to do with immigration. We have a bill out there that allows foreign workers to take American jobs.""

""The government needs to make changes to the H-1B program,"" he says. ""Even the lawmakers who made this law say it has been hijacked.""

Diangelo is referring to Bruce Morrison, a former Connecticut congressman who sponsored legislation creating the H-1B visa system but is now a vocal critic.

Several bills that aim to reform H-1B have been introduced in both the House and Senate this year. One of the co-sponsors of a House bill is Rep. Ro Khanna, an Indian-American from California's 17th Congressional District in the south San Francisco Bay Area and the heart of Silicon Valley.

Again, I thought of my own family as I read Khanna's bio. He was born in Philadelphia to parents who immigrated in the 1970s from India. Because of his background and because he represents so many who work in the tech industry, Khanna has taken heat for his stance on H-1B.

Please note: Ro Khanna, an Indian American politician funded heavily by NRIs, is championing restrictions on H1B: https://t.co/glRDDlYtLG — Rajiv Malhotra (@RajivMessage) March 3, 2017

Khanna tells me his Silicon Valley voters understand the need for reform. He says that as the son of immigrants, he understands the contributions of people who come from other lands. But their contributions cannot come at the expense of American workers.

""We need change so you don't have underpaid foreigners taking away American jobs,"" he says. ""This bill is pro-immigrant and pro-American worker.""

At the end of my conversation with Diangelo, he tells me the Infosys H-1B employee he trained wanted to be his friend.

""I couldn't allow myself to do that. I did not have hard feelings against him. But he was taking my job.""

Diangelo took early retirement; he did not want to transition into a new career so late in life and eventually found contract work in IT. Many of his co-workers, he says, are still unemployed.

""We don't go out as much or give to charities,"" he says of himself and his former colleagues. ""It has a downward spiral effect. A long-lasting one. It affects the morale of people.""

Every time he pumps gas at his local Costco, he looks up at the Eversource compound on a hill and thinks: My job is still there.

Growing demand

On a recent morning, I visit Monty Hamilton, CEO of Rural Sourcing Inc., a technology outsourcing company based in Atlanta.

There are no H-1B workers here. It goes against the mission of the company, Hamilton tells me.

Hamilton grew up in a two-stoplight town in Mississippi. When he chose vocation over location, he was forced to chase his dreams in a big city. He began his career with Accenture, another big recipient of H-1B visas, before taking the reins at Rural Sourcing in 2008.

The company's goal was to find smart IT employees, not in foreign countries but in secondary US cities outside Silicon Valley: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Mobile, Alabama; Augusta, Georgia.

""We do need to import some talent, but we need to do a better job in training the US workforce to get into this field that is changing so fast,"" he says.

Though he won't hire H-1B workers, Hamilton says it's folly to think the visas can be done away with altogether.

His fifth-floor office overlooks the campus of Georgia Tech. He tells me that all the foreign students who are about to graduate will be forced to go home unless they find employer-sponsored H-1B or other visas.

""Why in the hell would we allow that?"" Hamilton says.

America has 500,000 tech jobs open today, he tells me. And only 43,000 students who graduated with computer science degrees last year, he says, citing Code.org.

""How long does it take to fill a tech job? An average of 65 days. That tells me there is a shortage,"" Hamilton says.

Whether or not there truly is a shortage is the subject of much debate, I discovered. It often depends on the interpretation of statistics.

I read a petition that entrepreneurs including Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook co-signed with educators, nonprofits and governors from both political parties urging increased computer science education. ""There are currently over 500,000 open computing jobs, in every sector, from manufacturing to banking, from agriculture to healthcare, but only 50,000 computer science graduates a year,"" the letter said.

But I also read an Economic Policy Institute analysis that found American colleges graduate 50% more students in engineering and computer and information science than are hired in those fields each year.

Shortage or not, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted the number of technology jobs will rise from 3.9 million in 2014 to about 4.4 million in 2024. Part of the demand for tech jobs is due to the growing ""Internet of things,"" including cloud and mobile computing.

""Technology is changing fast,"" Hamilton says. ""We do need to import some talent, but we also need to do a better job in training the US workforce.""

I leave Hamilton's office and come across a group of young Indian engineering students enrolled at Georgia Tech. They tell me they want nothing more than to stay here for a job. If they don't get one right away, they will go home and try to return with an H-1B visa.

They talk about it as though it were a coveted prize, a ticket to success.

'Techsploitation'

For days, I ponder something Craig Diangelo told me. He realized his Indian H-1B replacement was also in a difficult position -- he had no idea he was going to America to take someone else's job.

H-1B workers brought over by outsourcing firms often don't know the circumstances they are about to face. They, too, are part of an abusive system, say H-1B critics.

The exploitation of Indian H-1B workers essentially amounts to indentured servitude, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting, which exposed what one worker called ""an ecosystem of fear.""

In a class-action lawsuit filed in California, H-1B workers described staffing agencies known as ""body shops"" that enticed workers to the United States and filed for their H-1B visas. Instead, when they arrived, the workers were huddled together in cramped ""guest houses"" and paid no wages until they were placed with a technology firm.

H-1B workers described having to pay the staffing agencies, pay for travel to jobs in other states and falling into debt before they even earned a penny.

Because H-1B visas are sponsored by companies, the employees are beholden to them. They risk losing their jobs and being sent back to India if they complain too loudly.

""It's human trafficking. They are being bought and sold,"" says Jack ""Jay"" Palmer, a former Infosys employee who brought a whistleblower lawsuit against the technology giant in 2012 alleging visa fraud.

Palmer accused Infosys of illegally using business visitor visas known as B-1 to fill positions in the United States. The B-1 visas are easier to obtain and have lower fees than H-1Bs and are intended for short stays to attend meetings and training sessions.

The lawsuit led to a federal investigation, and Infosys eventually agreed to a $34 million civil settlement with the Justice Department.

I catch Palmer on the phone as he's driving to the Atlanta airport for a flight to Washington. He says he's meeting with Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and a sponsor of the Senate H-1B reform bill.

""I believe in the American dream. I have nothing against H-1B and green cards,"" Palmer says. ""I just want to see the law enforced.""

A few hours later, I get a call from an Indian man whom Palmer has been helping. He tells me he is from Hyderabad, another technology hub in India, and was sponsored for an H-1B visa by Tata Consultancy Services.

He fears repercussions at his job in New York and speaks with me only after I agree to withhold his identity.

He says he worked in India for a decade before he came to America on an H-1B and was ""body-shopped."" He was placed in a job with a published salary of $45 an hour, but after the body shoppers and the outsourcing companies take their share, he only makes about $29.

The man is 45 and has a wife and two children -- 8 and 12. His expenses amount to about $5,000 a month, about $1,000 more than what he takes home. He has fallen into debt and no longer has the ability to climb out of it.

""We cannot save any money,"" he says. ""I have $20,000 in credit card debt, and I owe $15,000 for my car.""

""Why don't you go back home to India?"" I ask him.

""I do not even have money to buy tickets,"" he says.

He says he feels lucky, though. At least he is not in a ""guest house"" waiting for work.

Life, he says, goes on in limbo.

He says he was promised sponsorship for a green card but was asked to pay a $25,000 fee he couldn't afford. I spoke with another Indian H-1B worker in Atlanta who has applied for a green card, but the backlog is so great for Indian citizens that it can take up to 10 years or more. Until then, H-1B workers remain tethered to their employers.

""My dream was to come to America, but I don't want to stay here with this kind of life,"" the man in New York says. ""But I have no choice. I replaced American workers, but I am a victim, too.""

The man in New York is not alone. There are thousands of workers like him, Palmer tells me.

Palmer and other H-1B reformers want accountability.

They say US companies must be required to document their searches to fill positions with American workers. Employers must pay prevailing wages and be prevented from subcontracting or outsourcing H-1B jobs.

Reform advocates are pushing for a system of government enforcement and oversight of the H-1B regulations, not one that is reliant on whistleblowers to expose abuse.

Technology is here to stay. And it is changing at warp speed. The demand for smart talent is not going away. That's why even the biggest critics of H-1B are the most ardent backers of reform, not elimination.

What I hear them saying is the system ought to work the way it used to, when my father obtained an H-1 visa. He was hired for a job he was uniquely qualified for, and he was compensated with a decent wage.

No one wants to see Americans lose their jobs unfairly, and if my father were still alive, I know he'd be troubled by what I learned about the current H-1B program.

I also know he would be heartened to see that some of the most ardent backers of visa reform are Indian Americans. After all, we are the ones who have most reaped the rewards of H-1B.",2017-06-04 00:00:00
From Gandhi to guns: An Indian woman at the NRA,"The author, an Indian-American, visiting her first NRA convention on Friday.

Editor’s Note: This story was first published in April, after the author attended an NRA convention. She reflected again on what she heard and saw this week after learning of the Las Vegas massacre on Monday, which was also Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday.

(CNN) —

Guns are not a part of the culture of my homeland, except perhaps for the occasional Bollywood movie in which the bad guy meets his demise staring down the wrong end of a barrel.

My childhood in India was steeped in ahimsa, the tenet of nonviolence toward all living things.

The Indians may have succeeded in ousting the British, but we won with Gandhian-style civil disobedience, not a revolutionary war.

I grew up not knowing a single gun owner, and even today India has one of the strictest gun laws on the planet. Few Indians buy and keep firearms at home, and gun violence is nowhere near the problem it is in the United States. An American is 12 times more likely than an Indian to be killed by a firearm, according to a recent study.

It’s no wonder then that every time I visit India, my friends and family want to know more about America’s “love affair” with guns.

I get the same questions when I visit my brother in Canada or on my business travels to other countries, where many people remain perplexed, maybe even downright mystified, by Americans’ defense of gun rights.

I admit I do not fully understand it myself, despite having become an American citizen nearly a decade ago. So when I learn the National Rifle Association is holding its annual convention here in Atlanta, right next to the CNN Center, I decide to go and find out more.

My eyes open wide inside the vast and cavernous Georgia World Congress Center. I take in countless exhibits by the firearms industry and even check out a few guns. Among them are the Mossberg Blaze .22 semiautomatic Rimfire Rifle and an FN 509 semi-automatic 9mm pistol.

I’ve never had the desire to own a gun. I try hard to experience the excitement of others who are admiring these products.

Around me are 80,000 of America’s fiercest patriots and defenders of guns. Many are wearing American flag attire and T-shirts with slogans like: “Veterans before refugees” and “God loves guns.”

Few people here look like me. Most appear to be white and male. Many view the media, including my employer, with disdain – and they do not hesitate to let me know.

I walk around with some trepidation, but I’m determined to strike up conversations. I begin with this question: “Why do you want to own an object that can kill another human being?”

The answers are varied, but they center on three main themes: freedom, self-defense and sport. The first type of response is rooted in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows for the ownership of more than 300 million guns in America. How many other countries have the right to bear arms written into their very foundation? It’s unique and because of that, foreigners often have trouble grasping it.

I meet Chris Styskal at a booth set up by the NRA Wine Club. Yes, a wine club for the almost 5 million members of the organization.

“Eat, sleep, go fishing. Drink, sleep, go shooting. In that order,” Styskal jokes.

But then we get into serious talk. Gun ownership, he tells me, has its roots in the birth of this country.

“George Washington’s army fought off the British with rifles,” he says. “They overthrew an oppressive government.”

His statement gives me pause. The gun laws in India stem from colonial rule, when the British aimed to quell their subjects by disarming them. Perhaps my Indian compatriots should consider the right to own guns from this perspective.

Styskal, 41, earned a degree in psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University, and tells me the prevailing belief that gun owners are not educated is simply wrong. He owns a collection of rifles and pistols at his home in Port Carbon, Pennsylvania, and last year he fired 100 rounds every week at a shooting range.

He says the Second Amendment is about much more than the right to bear arms. It’s about freedom.

“We don’t want any government telling us what we can and cannot do.”

It’s a thought echoed by Brickell “Brooke” Clark, otherwise known as the American Gun Chic. She has a website by that name and also a YouTube channel. Both are bathed in hues of pink and dedicated to her recently formed passion for guns.

I introduce myself to Clark as we await President Donald Trump’s arrival at the convention. The darkened room is booming with NRA clips bashing everyone from Hillary Clinton to George Clooney.

“What would you tell my friends in India who say Americans are infatuated with guns?”

“I wouldn’t say Americans have an obsession with guns,” Clark says. “We have an obsession with being free.”

I ask what the Second Amendment means to her.

“It means I can live my life without anyone overpowering me,” she says. “It makes me equal with everyone else.”

The great equalizer. I never thought of the Second Amendment in that way.

Self-protection, I discover, is a huge reason many Americans own firearms.

Take Chloe Morris. She was born in Atlanta to Filipino parents; on this day, she’s brought her mother along to hear Trump, the first sitting President to speak at an NRA convention since Ronald Reagan.

Morris is 35, petite and soft-spoken, but she’s fierce about her opinions on guns.

“I’m 5 feet tall and 100 pounds,” she tells me. “I cannot wait for a cop to come save me when I am threatened with rape or death.”

Morris was once opposed to guns. “Extremely opposed,” she says.

She earned a master’s degree in criminal justice from Georgia State University. “I know the law,” she says. “For me guns were not the answer.”

But a few years ago, a dear friend was assaulted in her own home in an upscale Atlanta subdivision. The incident struck fear in Morris. She would never let herself become a victim.

She took shooting classes and became a Glock instructor. “I teach for free. I want women to be safe.

“I own 10 guns. I have a 14-year-old son. I started teaching him to shoot when he was 5. I’m a lifetime member of the NRA.”

She pauses, and her next sentence surprises me.

“I don’t think I can even kill another person – except when my life is in danger.”

In a way, I understand her position. My first real exposure to guns came after I embedded with the US Army and Marines to report the Iraq War. As a journalist I never carried a weapon, though soldiers coaxed me to learn how to shoot an M16. My conversation with Morris reminded me of a night when we came under threat, and the platoon sergeant placed a 9mm pistol on my Humvee seat. I refused to take it but knew instantly what he was trying to tell me. What if I were the last one alive? How would I save myself?

Luckily, we were safe that night. But I’ve always wondered how I might have acted under a dreadful scenario.

Other NRA members I speak with also tell me they don’t trust the police to arrive in time when they are in danger. Scott Long, 55, lives out in the country in Piketon, Ohio – 25 miles away from the county sheriff.

“The police can’t be there all the time,” he says, looking at his wife, DeeDee, and their three young children, whom he’s brought along to the convention for a mini family vacation. Their son Brody, 9, has been shooting at the pellet range and is excited about his first 20-gauge shotgun.

“Where we live, we can shoot in our backyard,” says Long, who owns 25 guns and is enjoying checking out all the shiny new weapons exhibited here.

Such remoteness, too, is alien to me. I grew up in a city that now brims with some 16 million people on a working day. Firing guns in my grandfather’s garden would not have been a good thing. I think about all the space we have in America. So many of us live far from other human beings. Like the Long family. Perhaps isolation adds to the need to own guns.

I move forward in my quest to know more.

I hear gun proponents express a dislike for big government. They stress individual liberties over the collective. For people who live in more socialist countries, it’s another obstacle to understanding American gun culture.

Near a stairway emblazoned with a giant Beretta, I speak with Derrick Adams. He’s a 32-year-old electric lineman from Nottingham, Pennsylvania. He describes himself as part black, part Puerto Rican and part Caucasian.

“How many guns do you own?” I ask.

“Not enough,” he replies.

He picked up his first Glock when he was 22, and his first shot shattered a whole bunch of stereotypes.

“People look at guns as this evil tool whose job it is to kill,” he says. “They’re not at all that. They are about protection.”

Adams believes that if all law-abiding citizens were armed, crime would drastically go down. He tells me that Chicago would not have such a high gun homicide rate if good folks in the inner cities were armed to fight “thugs and gangs.”

“Stop looking to government to help us. They are not our parents,” Adams says.

Liberals in America who want more gun control, says Adams, want to keep minorities and poor people dependent on government. Gun control started after slavery ended and was a way to keep black people disarmed, he says.

“You idiots,” Adams says, referring to all people of color. “It was invented to suppress you.”

He looks at me as though to say: You should know better.

Again, I think of colonialism in my homeland and how the British passed strict gun control to keep Indians from rising up.

Fighting tyranny and oppression is something Jaasiel Rubeck considers, too. The 29-year-old wife and mother from Columbus, Ohio, immigrated to this country from her native Venezuela when she was 6. People who live under authoritarian regimes should all understand the need to own a gun, she tells me.

Rubeck’s words remind me of a friend from Iraq who wished she could own a gun during Saddam Hussein’s rule. After he was overthrown, she slept with an AK-47 under her pillow at the height of the insurgency. She has always spoken of her love-hate relationship with guns. She wants to protect her family, but she is tired of the eternal violence plaguing her land. She wishes now that every gun would disappear from Iraq.

What I hear from speakers at the NRA convention, though, is that a peaceful world is a utopian fantasy – and that the need for guns will always exist.

“The NRA saved the soul of America,” says Chris Cox, the executive director of the organization.

I leave the convention trying to reconcile what I’ve gathered on this day with the philosophy of nonviolence with which I was raised. I am not certain that vast cultural differences can be bridged in a few hours, but I am glad I got a glimpse into the world of guns. I have much to consider.",2017-04-28 00:00:00
"Split by Trump's travel ban, a family races to reunite","(CNN) Abdalla hears his English teacher's voice beaming across the room like a ray of sunshine.

""What... is... the... matter?""

The teacher sounds out each syllable, pausing as photos of injuries flash on a projection screen. If you go to the doctor, she says, these are words you'll need to know.

In this Atlanta classroom, dozens of refugees who just arrived in the United States take notes.

Like them, Abdalla wants to learn. But he finds it hard to focus on the lesson.

He's thinking of his daughter, Batulo.

She's the one who soaks her feet in cold water to keep from dozing off while she studies.

She's the one who taught him the basics of speaking and writing in English.

She's the one who makes her brothers and sisters do their homework.

She's the one who should be here.

Abdalla is a tailor who barely had a chance to study in their native Somalia. Batulo is a bright student who loved to share lessons she learned at school.

She's 22 and dreams of becoming a doctor.

Photos: Refugees face uncertain journey to US President Trump's travel ban has created anxiety for Somali refugees at the crowded Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, some of whom are in limbo while awaiting resettlement in the US. Batulo Abdalla Ramadhan, 22, had been scheduled to travel in early February to join her parents and siblings in Atlanta, but Trump's executive order put her plans on hold. Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: Refugees face uncertain journey to US Abdullahi Ali Abdullahi, 31, was to be resettled in Columbus, Ohio, with his family until the travel ban, which was announced two days before they were scheduled to leave. In the interim his medical insurance expired and he cannot travel until it is renewed. ""We may be Muslims, but we have never taken part in terrorist attacks and we don't believe in it,"" he told CNN. Abdullahi's family fled Somalia when he was 6, after his grandfather was killed, and he has lived in refugee camps ever since. ""I still have the hope that I will be in America,"" he said. ""I want to do anything that will help develop the United States. I want to do that because they'd be giving me respect to welcome me.""

Instead, they remained at Kakuma, which is home to some 160,000 refugees. ""Life is about survival here,"" said their mother, Mano Abukar Abdullahi, who has been trying to resettle to the US since 2013. ""I want my children to get a better life than what we have at the camp."" Hide Caption 8 of 8

Only days ago, Abdalla thought America would give his daughter a chance to continue her studies and follow that path.

Instead, she's stuck in a refugee camp nearly 8,000 miles away, and he's not sure if she'll ever make it.

""I feel,"" Abdalla says, ""like someone cut off my arm.""

A new life

The day her family learned they'd be coming to the United States, Batulo was the one who opened the letter.

""Dad, we passed!"" she shouted into the phone.

Abdalla was so overjoyed he wanted to run naked through the streets. The years of screenings and interviews were worth it. Finally, after suffering an unspeakable tragedy and spending years on the run, his family would be safe.

But for Batulo, the joy was short-lived. Because of her age, she's not considered a dependent minor. Officials separated her case and told her she'd travel on her own later.

Abdalla tried to reassure his daughter. They'd just be apart for a matter of days, he told her. Then they'd begin a new life together.

That all changed on January 27.

The search for safety

Donald Trump was days away from taking the oath of office when Abdalla Ramadhan Munye and Habibo Mohamed landed in the United States. The Somali refugees had seven children in tow -- two daughters, three sons and a niece and nephew they'd been raising for a decade.

The family was just settling into their new apartment in the Atlanta suburb of Clarkston when Trump went to the Pentagon and signed an executive order titled ""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.""

Instead of settling into their new apartment, Somali refugees Habibo Mohamed and Abdalla Ramadhan Munye are fighting to reunite with their daughter.

His order blocked refugee arrivals for four months and banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries , including Somalia, for at least 90 days. Those were necessary steps, Trump said, to keep the US safe.

Batulo called her parents in tears from Kakuma, the Kenyan refugee camp she thought she was about to leave. Her trip had been canceled.

The stroke of a president's pen that day rewrote the first chapter of this Somali refugee family's life in the United States.

Their fresh start became a frantic search for help.

Buried alive

Batulo was weaving through the market stalls in Kakuma when she got the call. She had been searching for new shoes for her journey.

The official on the other end of the line told her not to bother.

""You are not able to go,"" he said. ""There is no journey taking place.""

Her flight had been canceled because of the new presidential order.

She began to cry.

Batulo had already given away most of her clothes and books to friends who needed them more. She'd moved in with a family who said she could stay with them while she waited.

She thought her flight was just days away.

Crowds gather outside the airstrip at Kakuma camp in northwest Kenya, where about 160,000 refugees live.

Now, however, a devastating reality is starting to set in: Her life of the past few days -- cooking and cleaning in a home that is not her own, relying on the kindness of a family that is not hers -- might be the only life she has left.

With her family gone, the joy has faded away from the world around her. In Kakuma, where she's lived for seven years, she watches the children playing outside, the chickens and goats ambling down the dry dirt roads, the occasional motorcycle rumbling by, sending dust into the air.

But that isn't what she sees.

""I just see Kakuma, I just see it, I'm just inside the hole,"" she says. ""They are ... burying me while I'm alive.""

A presidential plea

Tears well up in Habibo's eyes as she faces a room full of cameras.

She chokes up as she tells reporters about the last conversation she had with her daughter: ""I'm afraid she feels I abandoned her.""

Abdalla sits beside his wife, searching for the right words.

Speaking through an interpreter, Abdalla says he's afraid something will happen to the daughter they left behind in Kakuma. He begs the US government for help.

Speaking through an interpreter at a press conference in suburban Atlanta, Abdalla and Habibo plead for help.

There's one person in particular he hopes will hear his plea: first lady Melania Trump.

""She's a mother and she knows the love of a child,"" Abdalla says. ""I would like her to do her best to convince the president to change his mind.""

An exodus begins

Abdalla is terrified of losing another daughter. He already lost one.

The horrific details of that day in 2004 are still sharp in his mind.

How he and his oldest son, Ramadhan, went out to grind corn -- past the mango groves and the river where they'd hide sometimes when violence came to the Somali countryside.

How they headed back home and suddenly heard screams.

How they realized the screams were coming from inside their house.

How he found Habibo crying in a corner and their daughter, Famo, on the ground, covered in blood.

How Habibo told him men had stormed into their home, wearing masks and shouting in Somali.

How their 11-year-old had been raped and shot between the eyes.

How he tried to save her, pulling her in a cart toward the hospital.

How people warned him it was too late and told him she was gone.

How they were right.

How he buried her.

How he knew that day that they had to leave Somalia.

Keeping his family safe -- and together -- has been Abdalla's mission ever since.

'We are sorry'

Around the English classroom at the International Rescue Committee's Atlanta office, students practice reciting the ailments they've just learned.

On the walls, colorful posters spell out the the days of the week, the seasons of the year and the names of US presidents.

Erin Harwood begins her lesson at the International Rescue Committee's Atlanta office, where dozens of refugees who've just arrived in the United States are learning English.

While her students study, teacher Erin Harwood keys up a different presentation on the projector.

The screen shows a picture of Trump at a desk beside a photo of protesters waving signs.

""The president passed a refugee ban for 120 days. ... This word, ban, means stop,"" she tells them. ""Do you know why?""

A student in the middle of the classroom offers an answer: ""Because he didn't know the refugees.""

Harwood nods.

""He is a little afraid. He is afraid about terrorism,"" she says. ""But there are many people who think this is not a good idea. We want you to come here. We are sorry for the danger that he has put you in. And we are sorry for your families.""

She pauses, choking up.

""I am sorry for your families.""

A map flashes across the screen with seven countries highlighted in red. Several people in the classroom cheer when they see their homelands, unaware of why they've become the subject of this latest lesson.

""Number One Syria!"" yells one man.

""Number One Iraq!"" another counters.

But the mood quickly darkens as Harwood explains more about the travel ban. She tells her class that it will be harder -- maybe even impossible -- for refugees to ever come again from those seven countries.

A worksheet outlines vocabulary refugees need to know if they go to the doctor.

Several women begin to cry. Harwood tries to reassure them.

""You are here legally. You should not be worried,"" she says. ""The problem is for your families who want to come.""

The teacher passes out flyers advertising a community meeting where experts will answer refugees' questions about the executive order.

Abdalla writes down the address so he won't forget.

Disconnected

The voice of a child singing the ABCs echoes from a toy as 11-year-old Mana plays on the dining room floor. A cell phone video game blares in the living room as 7-year-old Ibrahim races a motorcycle down a track. Plates clank in the kitchen as 20-year-old Asha does the dishes.

There's a stack of shoes outside their front door, with a playground and a pond nearby. Happy families walk hand in hand as they take their children to school.

To the outside eye, this three-bedroom apartment in a placid neighborhood is a hive of a activity.

But Abdalla sees what isn't there.

His phone rings. It's Batulo.

Abdalla hands the phone to his youngest son, Ibrahim.

When the 7-year-old learned last week that his sister wasn't coming, he bolted out of the apartment and fell on his face. He still has a scrape above his lip.

Ibrahim, 7, at right, lights up when he hears his sister Batulo's voice on the phone.

Batulo reminds him to study and go to school. He smiles.

The family passes the phone around the room. Each of them lights up when they hear her voice.

Batulo tells her mother she doesn't have enough money to buy textbooks for school.

Then suddenly, the connection goes dark.

Everyone in the apartment freezes, like parts of a machine that halt when a gear stops turning.

The distant sounds of car horns and children laughing filter through the open front door.

But inside the apartment, quiet sniffles are the only sounds.

Habibo knows the signal is often spotty in the refugee camp. But any time a call gets disconnected, she's terrified.

She uses her bright yellow hijab to wipe away her tears, curls up on the couch and waits for her daughter to call back.

Looking for help

Batulo uses a plate to fan the flames beneath a pot on the dirt floor. The kitchen is hot and quickly fills with smoke.

She's cooking fava beans and bread for dinner.

Living on her own, she might not have enough food. So she's staying with this family of about a dozen people to share when resources are scarce.

""I don't have a job. I don't have anyone helping me,"" she says. ""I just come here to look for help.""

Batulo makes bread in a small kitchen at the Kakuma camp. Now that her parents and siblings have left, she's staying with another family to make sure she has enough food.

Batulo sleeps on a mattress with two other people, swatting away mosquitoes at night.

Thorny shrubs line the maze of paths between homes in this massive camp, where about 160,000 refugees live.

Calls to prayer waft through the air, which is thick with the smell of hot dust and burning trash.

Houses are made of mud, tin metal sheeting or wood layered with found items like tires or -- in the case of Batulo's current home -- cut and flattened tin cans.

The toilet is a hole in the ground lined with corrugated tin metal sheeting.

Her 24-year-old brother, Ramadhan, also lives in Kakuma and digs toilets for a living. He's also applied for refugee resettlement in the United States. But he's waiting for immigration officials to give him the green light to travel.

For now, whenever he earns anything extra, he gives Batulo money to call their parents.

Batulo pleads for their help convincing authorities to let her join them. She's heartbroken, but not hopeless.

In her spare time, she pores over the two books she has left: a copy of the Quran and an English textbook called ""New Horizons.""

Wrong number

The phone rings.

Abdalla looks up. Is it Batulo?

He doesn't recognize the number.

At night, he has trouble sleeping, thinking that the phone might ring.

When it does, his heart jumps. Could it be good news, or something unthinkable?

With his daughter stuck thousands of miles away, fear rattles Abdalla whenever his cell phone rings.

Whenever Batulo calls, he only talks with her briefly. He passes the phone quickly to others in the family because it's too heartbreaking to hear the pain in her voice and not know how to help.

But this time, the voice on the other end of the line is speaking in English, not in Somali or the Bantu language they often speak at home.

""I was calling about the Ford Explorer you listed for sale on Craigslist.""

Abdalla and his son, Juma, look at each other quizzically. They don't understand what the man is saying. They try to tell him why.

""Wrong number. Wrong number,"" Juma says.

The man on the phone won't take no for an answer.

""I'm calling about the Craigslist ad,"" he says in a Southern twang.

Abdalla takes the phone and gives it a try.

""No English. Speak Somali,"" he repeats.

The man on the other end seems puzzled, too.

""I don't speak Somali,"" he says. ""I'm an American. This is America.""

On the run

In Kenya, they were known as wakimbizi.

The Swahili word has come to mean refugee. But literally translated, it can also have another meaning: ""people on the run.""

For more than a decade, Abdalla and his family have been trying to stop running.

After Famo's death, they fled their village for the Somali capital of Mogadishu, where Abdalla says he worked in construction and his children sold charcoal for a year so they could make enough money to flee the country.

Abdalla and his family leave their shoes outside their apartment in Clarkston, Georgia. Today, they've left the door ajar to let in the breeze. But on some days when a stranger knocks, they're still scared to open it.

From there, they made their way to Kenya, trekking on foot for days until they reached their destination.

Fueled by fears for their family's safety, they moved across Kenya to Kakuma in 2009.

In 2012, they asked the UN for asylum, hoping an agency would help resettle them in a far-off land away from the dangers and uncertainties of life in refugee camps.

It took them years of applications, screenings and interviews to make it to the United States.

This was supposed to be the last stop in their search for peace.

But when a stranger knocks on the door of their Clarkston apartment, they are still too scared to answer.

A little escape

The family crowds into the living room, huddling around a cell phone that's sitting atop a plug less than a foot above the floor.

The tiny Samsung screen is smaller than an index card, but it still pops out against the blank white wall.

After he gets a job, Abdalla hopes to save enough money to buy a TV for his family. But for now, this cell phone is one of their few escapes.

Abdalla and his family don't have a TV, so they relax in their living room by watching videos on a cell phone.

A dubbed Somali version of the 2007 movie ""Shoot 'Em Up"" is playing.

The film stars Paul Giamatti and Clive Owen. The family got it about six months ago in Kenya. They've watched it almost every day since.

It's the best movie they have, Abdalla says. In it, a drifter on the run saves an innocent child.

An unanswered question

Abdalla and his family sit alone in the last row of folding chairs in an empty auditorium.

They've arrived at the Clarkston Community Center an hour and a half early for a refugee advocacy meeting. They weren't sure how long it would take to get here from their apartment, and they didn't want to be late.

They've been waiting for more than a week to come to this meeting, ever since their English teacher told them about it in class. They hope they'll have a chance to meet with officials who can help bring their family back together.

Abdalla smiles and nervously checks his phone. He's waiting for another message from Batulo.

Two days ago, his daughter called with news they'd been praying for. The International Organization for Migration scheduled a new flight for her to come to the United States. Her arrival could be days away.

Batulo has lived in the Kakuma refugee camp since 2009. But until now she's never been apart from her family.

But to Abdalla and Habibo, it still seems like a dream that could disappear.

Before long, the room is packed with refugees searching for answers about the executive order.

A local resettlement official takes the stage to share a rundown of the latest developments. Federal courts have temporarily blocked the travel ban, she says.

""Right now refugees are still arriving, and they will still arrive as long as the courts decide that the president can't stop refugee resettlement,"" Frances McBrayer of Catholic Charities of Atlanta tells them.

It's been days since the judges' decision. But this is the first Abdalla and Habibo have heard of it.

A feeling of relief washes over Habibo. The courts have given her hope.

But no one can answer her most pressing question: Is Batulo really on the way, or could another decree leave her stuck in Kenya?

'A younger man'

Abdalla holds his phone out in front of him and walks toward the window of the apartment, letting the afternoon sun hit his face.

Batulo texts her family a photo to let them know she's OK.

He's using an app on his phone to video chat with Batulo, who's at a transit center in Nairobi waiting to begin her journey.

It's been almost a month since the last time they talked face to face.

Batulo is more than 8,000 miles away now. But this is the closest she's been in weeks.

She can close her eyes and picture her life in the United States.

She imagines sitting on a couch with her brothers and sisters, watching a movie.

She imagines finding a job and earning enough money to help her family.

She imagines the beautiful home where they will live.

But looking at her cell phone screen, Batulo is shocked. Her father is wearing a suit coat -- something she never saw him do in the refugee camp. It changes the way she sees him.

""You look like a younger man,"" she says.

The suit coat was a donation Abdalla picked up recently at the IRC. And it's come in handy as he learns to handle winter weather.

""You'll see,"" he tells his daughter. ""It's so cold here, even you will wear a jacket.""

Lights in the sky

Abdalla clutches his cell phone as the van hurtles down the highway.

It's been nearly 24 hours since the last message from his daughter flashed across the screen.

Batulo told him she was on a plane at the Nairobi airport. He hasn't heard from her since.

Questions are racing through his mind.

Batulo's family excitedly searches for signs of her at the Atlanta airport. It's been more than a month since they were together.

Is she on the way? What if she gets lost? Is the nightmare they've been living really about to end?

Abdalla stares out the front windshield of the van shuttling him and his family to the Atlanta airport. He doesn't look at the billboards or the exit signs or the other cars zooming past.

His eyes are focused on the night sky.

The white and red lights on passing planes swoop like twinkling birds overhead.

He hopes Batulo is inside one of them, looking down and watching him, too.

Racing to reunite

For minutes that feel like hours, Abdalla and his family stand like statues in a line, their eyes laser focused on the set of escalators at Atlanta's airport where waves of arriving passengers emerge.

Businessmen with briefcases, pilots in uniforms and families wearing winter coats come into view.

But so far, there's no sign of Batulo.

Suddenly, Abdalla yells and bolts across the waiting area, past a bright red security line on the floor that says ""DO NOT CROSS.""

Guards shout. He doesn't hear them. To Abdalla, only one thing matters now. He sees his daughter's face and sprints toward the light.

He sweeps Batulo into his arms and carries her like a running back toward a wall on the other side of the lobby. The rest of the family follows, like a trail behind a comet as it speeds through the sky.

Habibo sobs as she sits beside Batulo on the airport floor. They had feared this day would never come.

Batulo is still wearing a plastic pouch around her neck, stuffed with a plane ticket and an ID card from the International Organization for Migration.

""I am a refugee from SOMALIA,"" the card says. ""I may not speak English and need help to find my next flight.""

Batulo flew more than 10,000 miles to get here, from Kakuma to Nairobi to Dubai to New York to Atlanta. American Airlines Flight 1687 brought her to a strange city, yet she is home.

Abdalla and his family sit on the airport floor, pressed together like puzzle pieces. They cling to each other, sobbing.

A new home

Batulo beams as she sips a can of Sprite through a straw.

Her sisters tug at her arms, pulling her from room to room as they show her their new home.

The living room floor is covered with plates stacked high with food that the family cooked together for hours as they awaited her arrival.

They sit in a circle, devouring baked chicken, fried fish, french fries and ugali, a cornmeal dish they prepared especially for Batulo.

Abdalla sends a voice message to Ramadhan, his oldest son, who's still living in Kakuma. Batulo made it safely, he says.

Batulo's brother, Juma, pulls her suitcase as the family heads home from the Atlanta airport.

Ramadhan replies that he's relieved. ""God willing,"" he says, ""someday I will make it, too.""

As they eat, Batulo's family peppers her with questions.

Is there a still a mango hanging from the tree outside the transit center in Nairobi?

How many countries did you fly through to get here?

When we left, you didn't look like this. Why are you so thin?

Ibrahim brings out some of his favorite new toys. Together, they sing the ABCs. He falls asleep, curled up on the floor beside his sister.

Abdalla yawns, then quickly gulps down a cup of coffee.

Exhaustion is starting to set in, but this is a moment he doesn't want to miss. He leans back against the couch and listens to his daughters' voices.

The only sound he hears is laughter.",2017-02-21 00:00:00
The dreams of 'Baby Noor',"Her smile melted hearts, and Americans saved her life at the height of war. Now 11, the Iraqi girl heads to another faraway land to face another crisis — with hope.

Noor's father cradles her head, shaven clean of a gush of black hair. ""Baba! Baba!"" she screams. ""Don't let go. Don't let them take me.""

Her voice bounces down the outdoor corridors of a remote hospital as nurses rush the gurney toward an operating room. She clutches her father's hands as though she will never see him again.

It is not an easy scene for me to witness. After reporting on Noor and her father for more than a decade, I've grown attached; it's almost as though I am watching my own family suffer.

Noor al-Zahra Haider bears the double misfortune of being born with a life-threatening defect in a land torn by war. She was saved by an unlikely encounter with American soldiers and called Iraq's miracle baby. By all measures, it's remarkable the 11-year-old has lived to see this day.

But like her homeland, Noor struggled to stake out a brighter future. And now, once again, it hangs in the balance. I know her father is praying for another miracle.

Noor's spinal cord did not fully form at birth, a congenital condition called spina bifida. She has no movement or any sensation below her waist and is prone to excessive fluid buildup in her head.

Doctors in America implanted a shunt, or drain, to relieve painful and potentially damaging pressure in her head. But without routine medical care in Baghdad, she developed severe infections, forcing her to travel again to a faraway land, to this hospital in Uganda, for brain surgery.

Haider Khalaf al-Tamimi kisses his daughter, Noor, before her surgery. His life is guided by one thing: to make hers better.

Haider Khalaf al-Tamimi accompanied his daughter knowing the scope of the treatment and its limitations. Still, he hopes for the realization of a dream that has remained constant.

In that vision, his daughter is not a sickly child slumped in a wheelchair, unable to care for herself. Instead, Noor stands tall -- a young woman, strong and beautiful, walking with open arms toward her father.

Haider has not allowed himself to wish for life's extravagances; he considers himself fortunate just to survive each day in Baghdad. But this dream gives him strength.

He kisses Noor's dimples as nurses pump propofol through her veins and then whisk her away behind closed doors. Haider settles into a hard metal chair, his head bowed low. He can do nothing now but wait.

For the first time in the 11 years I have known him, I see him cry.

Help from afar

On a December day in Baghdad, Haider and Noor received an offer of help from a land they had never heard of: Uganda.

They looked it up on a map and were happy to learn that it wasn't as far away as America.

Haider felt both relief and anxiety. Noor's trip to the United States for life-saving surgery was a decade ago. Since then, he had not been able to access the kind of follow-up care a child such as Noor needs. So many of Iraq's medical specialists fled the country, and hospitals are without staff and resources.

Noor has to be catheterized to relieve herself and she often develops urinary tract infections. As she's gotten older, debilitating headaches have kept her home from school. Haider knows that without proper monitoring, there is a chance she might suffer brain damage.

From the time Noor was only 3 months old, I've watched Haider worry about her. He's seen Noor cry when boys on the street made fun of her limp legs, her feet contorted in unnatural positions and dangling off her wheelchair. He's heard Noor yell out of anger and frustration when her stepbrothers and cousins ran up the stairs at home to play and she was left alone.

Noor al-Zahra Haider is growing up with disabilities in a war-torn land. Desperate for care, she and her father traveled to a hospital in a remote part of Uganda, a place that felt alien to them in many ways.

Teachers told him his daughter is bright, but no public school would take her. He couldn't afford a private education. So he is forced to send her to a special school for the disabled with lower educational standards. Every morning, he puts Noor in a minivan long before the sun rises, before the streets of Baghdad turn menacing, so she can sit in classes with children who've lost limbs in the war or suffer from severe cognitive ailments.

Haider worries about his daughter just as he worries about the future of his country. Answers once seemed within grasp, but problems kept mounting. He felt as though he were gazing into a crystal ball and yet, none of the images shone clear.

No cure: ‘Water on the brain’ The hospital in Uganda treating Noor serves as an oasis for children with a life-threatening ailment.

He knows life is hard enough for women in Iraq. For one with physical limitations, things could be that much tougher. Will any man marry her when she is grown? Who will take care of her when he is gone?

So when a hospital in Uganda agreed to treat Noor, Haider felt he could not say no. He imagined a big, shiny hospital like the one in Atlanta that had set his daughter on a path to survival.

Childspring, the Atlanta-based charity that helped sponsor Noor's trip to America in 2006, arranged the visit to Uganda, but Haider was full of questions. We talked by phone in the days before he left Baghdad. He told me it would be an arduous trip for Noor but worth it if doctors could help her.

""It will be good if you can come to meet us,"" he said. ""You have seen her from the beginning.""

Life and death

That beginning seems so fantastical to me now.

In 2005, the year Noor was born, I was a newspaper reporter embedded with a Georgia Army National Guard infantry unit patrolling Abu Ghraib, the town just west of Baghdad notorious for its high-security prison.

The soldiers of Charlie Company were attached to the storied 10th Mountain Division and had seen combat for seven long months. They were exhausted by a guerrilla war that at times seemed futile and intractable. They couldn't tell friend from foe; trust had become a scarce commodity.

Andrew Renneisen for CNN

On an uncomfortably chilly night two weeks before Christmas, the soldiers burst into the home of Haider's father during a routine raid. They searched the rooms, rounded up the men and questioned the family.

Haider's mother, Soad, spoke to them through an Army translator. She was the backbone of the family, strong and unafraid to carry her tribe through difficult times.

She harbored little love for the Americans, who had accused her eldest son, Bashar, of firing a rocket-propelled grenade and detained him at Camp Cropper near the Baghdad airport. Her neighbor was hit by an American bullet intended for insurgents. And a US tank rolled over a kiosk she used to sell groceries at the local market.

But Soad realized that moment was her only chance to help her ailing granddaughter. She mustered up her courage, picked up Noor and turned her on her belly, revealing a purplish tumor on her back one-third the size of her body.

""If you want to help Iraq,"" Soad blurted out to the soldiers, ""you will help her instead of bothering the innocent.""

That was my first image of Noor. Even in the midst of Baghdad's carnage, it was shocking to see such a deformity in a baby.

Noor would be a burden to her family in Baghdad and it was better to let her die, Iraqi doctors advised.

Noor was not yet 3 months old, the first child born to Haider and his wife, Iman. They had been trying for two years to conceive and were overcome with joy when Iman learned she was pregnant. But days before the birth, doctors warned the young couple that something was wrong.

After Noor was born, pediatricians at Baghdad's Yarmouk Hospital told Haider his daughter was defective. They had no treatment for spina bifida. Even if she survived, they said, she would be nothing but a burden, especially in the midst of war. Better to let her die, they advised.

But Haider would have nothing of it. He named his baby Noor, which means light in Arabic. He was determined to help her. He just didn't know how. I saw him as a quiet man who, at 24, lacked the fortitude of his mother; he was not ready to assume the enormous responsibility of raising a daughter with disabilities.

Haider's sister Ghufran helps Noor get dressed one morning before the surgery. Noor grew close to her aunts after her mother left the family, and Ghufran accompanied her to Uganda as a caregiver.

But Soad's audacious plea stirred something in the soldiers. They acted to save Noor's life.

Surreal scenes unfolded at the height of the Iraq War: American soldiers in full battle gear clandestinely drove heavily armored Humvees and Bradley Fighting Machines in the dead of night to Abu Ghraib, evading sniper fire and roads laced with improvised explosive devices, and slipped away with an Iraqi child, her father and grandmother.

I sat with Soad, Haider and Noor in a dusty Humvee as the soldiers broke convention and brought the Iraqi family onto a vast US military base adjacent to the Baghdad airport.

Every day at Camp Liberty, as the family waited for whatever would come next, I helped Soad tend to Noor in the family's trailer. I found it amusing to see hardened infantrymen take turns with a milk bottle and convoy out of the base to buy diapers. Their commanders, meanwhile, worked diplomatic and military channels to clear the way for Noor and her family to fly to the United States. It was not easy to secure visas for Iraqis at the height of the war.

On New Year's Eve, I watched Noor, Haider and Soad soar into a cloudless Baghdad sky. They left for America with great hope and as much trepidation. They were keenly aware their association with the United States might come back to haunt them in Iraq. But the way they saw it, there was no choice.

It was a matter of life or death for Noor.

'Is it like America?'

All these years later, Haider was again leaving Baghdad with Noor. Again, he felt there was no choice.

At 35, Haider has survived a mandatory stint in Saddam Hussein's army, the 2003 US-led invasion, the rise of al Qaeda and, most recently, ISIS. He knows he could easily have been in the city's Karrada neighborhood last July when a massive bomb ripped through a shopping center packed with Ramadan revelers and killed nearly 400 people. Noor loves fashionable clothes, and the malls are one place where she can be wheeled around.

On a late January day, he looked at his daughter, dressed to perfection for their trip in a black-and-brown plaid woolen cape, matching derby hat and fringed suede booties. They said their goodbyes to the family, and Haider carried Noor to the taxi he began driving after he abandoned his failing sidewalk produce business.

He doesn't particularly like carrying strangers around Baghdad. Every morning, before he leaves the house, he kisses Noor, his two sons and his wife, brothers and father and tells them he loves them. This has become as routine as the uncertainty gripping their lives in a city that still suffers from bloody bombings. Haider never assumes he will come home alive.

Noor was born with a congenital defect that prevented her spinal cord from fully developing. As a result, she has no sensation below her waist and is prone to fluid buildup in her head, as these CT scans show.

He climbed into the taxi with Noor and his sister Ghufran, who agreed to go to Uganda as a caregiver. Noor is almost a teenager now. Cognizant of the changes in her body, she's grown increasingly embarrassed by her dependence on others.

She lets only a few people close to her: her aunts Ghufran, Hijran and Zainab and her stepmother Fatima. Noor's mother left the family when Haider and Noor were in America, and Noor began calling her aunts and stepmother Mama.

With Haider and Mama Ghufran holding her hands, Noor settled into a window seat on the Boeing 737. The last time she flew, Baghdad's commercial airport, named after Saddam Hussein, stood like a dinosaur, a relic of a regime past. She'd taken off instead in a US Army C-130, asleep in her grandmother's lap and blissfully unaware of the attention showered on her and the attention that was to come.

This time was so different. She was out of the spotlight and curious.

""Where are we going? Is it like America? What will the doctors do to me? Will I be able to walk?""

Almost every day, Noor raises her limp legs with her hands and asks when she might walk. The hardest thing for Haider is to watch Noor try to process the severity of her problems. It is also hard for him to provide explanations grounded in reality. The answers are crushing.

So he lets her hope. He lets himself hope.

Father and daughter took off for Entebbe with their dreams intact.

Broken girl, broken land

I keep two photographs tucked in a clear flap in my wallet. One shows my mother, who died in 2001. The other is of Noor at age 6.

""I am glad you are coming to Uganda,"" she'd told me in a phone call a few days before she left Baghdad. ""I am glad you are coming to see me.""

I look at the tiny photo in my wallet on my long flight to Entebbe, almost in disbelief that it has been 11 years since I first saw her.

Noor might not have survived without the American soldiers but she faced a lifetime of struggle in Iraq.

Over the years, I'd written several stories and with each, I came to understand the significance of Noor.

For the soldiers of Charlie Company, many of whom were fathers themselves, the little Iraqi girl offered a chance at a tangible victory in a war that seemed to be going nowhere. It was important for them to engage in an act of humanity.

Noor arrived in Atlanta as somewhat of a celebrity. Pictures of her smile lit up newspapers and appeared on television stations. She was a sliver of good news at a time when public support for the Iraq War was waning.

Doctors at the state-of-the-art Children's Healthcare of Atlanta performed a series of operations to realign and close her spinal column and release congenitally shortened tendons and overly tight ligaments in the back of her left ankle. Then, Dr. Roger Hudgins, a pediatric neurosurgeon, inserted a shunt to drain the excess cerebral fluid collecting beneath the outer membrane covering Noor's brain.

Everyone involved with Noor had the best of intentions. But no one had fully thought through the future. What would life be like for a child with severe disabilities in Iraq? She would be a broken girl in a broken land.

An unfinished miracle: Before Uganda, CNN's Moni Basu caught up with Noor in 2013, just before the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War. She was 7 then and her problems were worsening.

Hudgins warned Haider that Noor would need a lifetime of medical monitoring. The doctor was also direct in telling him that Noor would never gain use of her legs, though he could not bear to dash his yearning for a miracle.

""I'm not here to take away hope. Time will tell.""

Haider and Soad left America after three months. Noor remained with hosts in Atlanta until she finished her treatment, then was flown back to Iraq.

For the soldiers and Noor's caregivers in America, her story ended. But for Noor and her family, it was just the beginning -- the beginning of a difficult life.

Just as they had feared, Noor's family paid a price for accepting American help. Their shop in the market was bombed, and Haider said he was abducted twice and held for ransom by men he thought belonged to al Qaeda in Iraq.

The first time she had surgery in Atlanta, Noor was a media celebrity. This time, she is quietly treated at CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda, run by an American faith-based charity.

Haider told me his wife, Iman, never bonded with their baby. In some ways, she blamed herself for giving birth to a disabled child. After their divorce, Haider got married again to a longtime friend, Fatima.

Sectarian strife forced the family to abandon Abu Ghraib and move into a more humble house in a largely Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad. Noor's grandmother, Soad, died in 2008, but she took care to save a scrapbook she'd compiled with all the newspaper stories about Noor.

For many years now, Noor has been aware of her history, that she is the ""Baby Noor"" who melted American hearts. She has always talked about the soldiers, Atlanta and even me as though from memory.

The photo of Noor that I carry in my wallet is a school portrait she gave me when we last met in Baghdad four years ago. It was the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War and to me, she served as a metaphor: She was someone the Americans saved, just like they saved Iraq from Saddam Hussein. But then she was left to figure out a future for herself.

A hospital in the middle of nowhere

I am eager to see Noor again, and the car ride from Entebbe International Airport to the eastern city of Mbale cannot go fast enough. It takes 10 hours to travel 160 miles on a pot-holed, traffic-jammed two-lane highway. It's the same herky-jerky journey Haider, Ghufran and Noor made four days earlier, peering out the window as though they'd landed on another planet.

Haider had expected spotless roads and neatly manicured mansion-size houses such as the ones he saw in Atlanta. Or grocery stores that offered a dizzying array of frozen foods and produce aisles where automatic misters kept cucumbers and baby lettuce leaves moist.

Instead they traveled through a landscape of lush savannas, banana trees and villages with round huts and thatched roofs. They passed through towns with muddy open-air markets and loud signage advertising everything from prepaid cellular cards to Coca-Cola and HIV prevention programs.

The CURE hospital is nothing fancy -- a collection of airy brick buildings set amid palm trees. But doctors have developed innovative procedures to treat children like Noor who are suffering from hydrocephalus, or fluid buildup.

Their destination, CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda, is run by an American Christian charity and operates with a motto of ""healing the sick and proclaiming the kingdom of God."" It specializes in treating children with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, the medical term for excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain. The doctors here gained worldwide recognition for practicing an innovative procedure that is shuntless and therefore less prone to infection.

This is one reason Noor has been brought here. She has not seen a neurosurgeon since her time in Atlanta and doctors in Baghdad were clear: Take her out of Iraq.

When I last saw Noor in 2013, I'd accompanied her to see her pediatrician, Dr. Saad Nasser Hewady, who has been examining her for the past six years. He told me then that Noor's headaches had worsened but it was impossible to know the extent of the problem by looking merely at CT scans.

Noor was 7 then and already embarrassed by her bathroom needs. The family was forced to use single-use catheters multiple times because they were unavailable in Baghdad.

""I am disappointed with myself. I wish I had left Noor in America."" Haider Khalaf al-Tamimi

Sometimes, Noor could not stand to be around normal children. She once had a fight with one of her cousins who told her: ""I am better than you. I can walk.""

Noor screamed back: ""Some day, I will walk.""

Haider fretted not only for Noor's physical disabilities but he'd grown increasingly concerned about her mental state. He begged me: ""Please, take my daughter to America. She needs help.""

After the 2013 CNN story on Noor, Childspring, the charity that had sponsored her medical treatment in Atlanta, raised enough money to send a new wheelchair as well as a supply of catheters. It also renewed efforts to pair Noor with specialists.

But the logistics of taking a child out of Iraq were tricky and the nonprofit agency's budget was limited. Finding a suitable hospital willing to provide pro bono services proved difficult. The agency stepped up its efforts in recent months after it became apparent that Noor's internal infection required immediate treatment.

It's almost dark when I finally arrive at the CURE hospital in Mbale, a collection of simple and airy brick bungalows with white-washed walls and young patients the color of ebony.

Some are sleeping in mosquito nets -- Uganda is where the Zika virus originated and where yellow fever and malaria are present. Some have heads many times the size of their stick-like bodies. They look like balloons about to burst. One child rocks back and forth nonstop from the pressure in his head. Another cannot close his eyes and stares vacantly into nowhere.

CNN reporter Moni Basu meets Noor after almost four years. Basu has been following Noor's story since the girl was 3 months old.

Noor's story again seems fantastical. She's an Iraqi girl saved by Americans who has come to this East African city disconnected in many ways from the world, to a hospital that at first appears an unlikely place for complex surgery.

I get ready to ask a guard for directions to Noor's room, but I turn to find her waiting for me. Her aunts in Baghdad have already chopped her long hair in anticipation of what's to come, and she has it pinned back with a pink clip. I can see scabs on her head as I bend to kiss her.

I marvel at how much she's grown; she's too big for the wheelchair sent to her four years ago. How silly, I think, that I still refer to her as ""Baby Noor."" But how incredible that I am here for another pivotal moment in her life.

A father's regrets

Childspring arranged to pay for two rooms at the hospital, but Haider, Noor and Ghufran want to be together. In Room No. 2, Noor and her ""mama"" squeeze into a railed bed every night, and Haider sleeps on a vinyl foldout chair.

The small room with dulled terrazzo floors and an attached bathroom is to be their home for the foreseeable future, two weeks at the very least. The hospital's medical director, Dr. Peter Ssenyonga, has already examined Noor, taken new scans of her head and prescribed antibiotics to clear the infection caused by the old shunt. He is not sure yet about the surgical options, and with each passing day, Haider grows more anxious.

He smokes to relieve stress and quickly exhausts the supply of Esse cigarettes he brought from Baghdad.

Every morning, he and Ghufran wheel Noor to a covered outdoor cafeteria next to the hospital's small kitchen. Worried that the food here is not halal, Haider decides to go to the market to buy bananas, bread, eggs, tomatoes and tea. He spends $500 for groceries and thinks Uganda is expensive -- until he figures out he has been cheated out of change.

On this morning, Ghufran offers me a plate of scrambled eggs and tomatoes. Haider tells me he has too much time to think. The days are long this close to the equator.

Haider often is filled with regret and wishes he had left his baby girl in the United States where she might have had access to better care and a chance for a normal life.

""I am disappointed with myself,"" he blurts out after breakfast. ""I wish I had left Noor in America, with Nancy.""

Nancy and Edward Turner hosted Noor and her family for many weeks in their suburban Atlanta home. Nancy is the one who escorted Noor back to Kuwait so that the US Army could return her to Baghdad.

""I selfishly wanted Noor to come home to Baghdad,"" Haider says. ""But America would have been better for her.""

He knows children with spina bifida can lead close-to-normal lives in medically advanced countries such as the United States. Noor could be going to a better school and have access to a neurosurgeon and a gastrointestinal specialist. He doesn't see anything but bleakness in Iraq's future and laments raising children there.

His words grow heavy with regret.

""I feel Noor could have fulfilled her dreams in America,"" he says. ""She wants to be a lawyer or a teacher. She wants to help others. But we don't have good education in Iraq anymore.""

He mentions Roger Hudgins, the neurosurgeon who operated on Noor in Atlanta. Hudgins told Haider that Noor could be anything she wanted, that she could become Iraq's first woman president.

""Maybe she still can, but I no longer wish it,"" Haider says. ""It's so dangerous. She will be killed in Iraq.""

When I last saw her in Baghdad, I noticed a sadness about Noor that tainted even the smile that once enthralled the public. I can see the same sadness blanket her here in Mbale.

""Do you think she is happy?"" I ask Haider.

""I don't know,"" he replies. ""She is so sensitive and falls sick easily. The other thing is she never got her mother's care.""

Noor's aunts occasionally take her to see her mother, Iman. Noor wants so badly to be loved by her, but Haider says Iman chooses to remain disconnected. He says Iman doesn't even know Noor is about to have surgery in Uganda.

The staff at the CURE hospital gather to pray several mornings a week. Noor's family had never seen singing and dancing at a religious service.

Noor spends most of her time at the hospital video chatting with Fatima and her aunts on Viber and Facebook and playing games on her Samsung phone. ""Fruit Burst"" is her favorite. But she's also keenly aware of what is being said around her.

Noor seems at once childish and wise for her age. She has grown up somewhat sheltered, but Ghufran says Noor is the one who consoles her aunts when they've had a spat with their husbands.

I glance at her, sitting away from earshot in the corridor with paper and pencils in hand. She likes to draw pictures of the Iraqi flag. And butterflies.

""My daughter is my hope and my future. Everything I do is for her."" Haider Khalaf al-Tamimi

I wonder how much Noor comprehends of the situation in her homeland, of her own situation. Haider tells me Noor has seen other children born with spina bifida in Iraq who suffer from hydrocephalus. A relative's infant daughter, Seba, died three months ago. Noor keeps a photo of her on her phone.

Haider and I continue our conversation through my translator, Akram Hazaea, the 24-year-old son of Yemeni immigrants who settled in Mbale many years ago. Akram's niece also suffered from hydrocephalus and was operated on here at the CURE hospital. I can see he feels a bond with Haider.

Haider tells Akram he was taken aback when he first arrived at the hospital. It seems so rustic. He compares it to the facilities he saw in Atlanta and fears Noor could end up like some of the children in the wards.

Tim Erickson, a father of three from Massachusetts who is the executive director of the hospital, joins us in our conversation and tries to put Haider at ease.

""I am glad you made it. It was a long journey,"" he says. ""Is Noor able to go to school in Baghdad?""

""Yes. But she fell ill during her exams and so she's having to repeat a year.""

Haider did not tell Noor the scope of her surgery, but her anxiety is plain to see as the day draws near.

Haider pauses before asking the question always burning in his mind.

""Have you ever seen a case where someone has been able to walk again?""

""I think it depends on where the growth is,"" Erickson says. ""This would be something to ask the doctors. I think it's God's decision.

""Frankly,"" Erickson says, ""the fact that Noor's shunt has worked so long is a miracle.""

""Yes,"" says Haider. ""My daughter is my hope and my future. Everything I do is for her.""

'Pray for her'

On the morning of Noor's surgery, Haider cannot bear to tell her the whole truth.

Nurses have directed him to take her to a barbershop in town to get her head shaved. Noor thinks they are going to a beauty salon like the ones she sometimes visits with her aunts in Baghdad.

But it doesn't take long for Noor to recognize her fate. Tears stream down her face as mounds of hair fall to the floor. Haider cannot bear to see her this way and stands in front of her, desperate to block her reflection in the mirror. Ghufran holds her phone close so that her stepmother and aunts in Baghdad can see.

The women are crying. Noor is howling.

""Why is he cutting it all off?"" she cries. ""Baba, take me out of here.""

Strangers peer inside the shop to see what the commotion is about. A small crowd forms to watch the heartbreaking scene.

I ask Akram to run across the street and buy a scarf so we can cover Noor's head, exposed now with its many scars and imperfections. Ghufran helps wrap the orange and blue scarf, and Haider carries her back to the van. On our return to the hospital, Haider holds his daughter in his arms.

He is no longer the shy young man who walked in his mother's shadow. He is not afraid to show his love for his daughter, though that might be considered unmanly in Haider's world.

During surgery, Noor's doctor decides to remove the shunt placed in her head when she was a baby. It had disintegrated and was causing painful infection.

At 11:15, nurses arrive with a stretcher to take Noor to the operating room. The moment has finally arrived. Amid Noor's screams and Haider's tears, a nurse grabs my shoulder.

""Tell them to pray for their baby,"" she says.

In that moment, the images of Noor's story burn brilliant in my mind, as though it all happened just yesterday. The nurse cannot know the family's incredible journey.

But I try to honor her request with my reply:

""They have been praying for her since she was born.""

A question and a crushing answer

In the hours after the surgery, Noor is transferred to a bed on the far end of an intensive-care unit filled with children who have undergone similar brain surgery. She is the only patient from a non-African country, and the nurses have developed a special affection for ""the Arab girl."" They make up for their inability to communicate in words with their generous smiles.

Noor was a broken girl in a broken land. Now she was getting another shot at survival.

The anesthesia has made Noor woozy. She's been vomiting her food, and Ghufran and Haider don't always get the bucket to her bed in time.

""Baba, I want you to take me out of here,"" she wails to Haider.

When she drifts into sleep, I see Haider examining the bandage covering the stitches on Noor's head and gently gliding his fingers across her cheeks. Then, he asks Akram, the translator, to take us into town.

There, we stop at a small shop and under the glare of fluorescent tube lights, we inspect at least a dozen wigs for Noor. Haider decides to buy a short bob cut, and we move on to our next stop: Chicken Papa, Mbale's version of KFC. Akram assures Haider that he knows the owner and the food is halal.

Our last stop is at a supermarket so Haider can buy cigarettes. He's been in Mbale for six days and smoked all the packs from Iraq.

Haider heads out to the central market in Mbale to purchase a wig for Noor after seeing his daughter so traumatized by her shaven head.

The errands divert Haider's attention for a while, but back at the hospital, he's impatient to speak with Ssenyonga, the medical director. Haider still does not know whether the surgery was a success.

The doctor visits Noor the next day after she has been transferred back to her regular room. He explains to Haider that he removed Noor's shunt, which had disintegrated and caused pockets of pus to develop in her head. That is why she had suffered from constant headaches.

""How are you?"" asks Ssenyonga, shaking Noor's hand.

Haider tells the doctor that Noor doesn't feel well.

""If I were to go from Uganda to Iraq and then went through all this, I, too, would be sick,"" Ssenyonga says, smiling in his scrubs and a Barcelona football cap.

Ssenyonga doesn't talk much, but when he does, every word matters. He understands Haider's anxiety -- he has three daughters of his own.

Haider fires off a barrage of questions.

""Should she be in bed?""

""Why the bed?"" Ssenoyenga replies. ""She needs to be out. People need to see her smile.""

""When will you know if she needs another procedure? What if the problems start again after we go back home?""

""If she needed a shunt, we'd know it by now,"" Ssenyonga says. ""If there was pressure building, she's start feeling headaches, become drowsy and maybe even vomiting. Her shunt had not been working for a long time. We don't need to operate.""

""What about the swelling?""

""Those were the pockets of pus from the infection. I think she will feel all right.""

""I am so grateful to you,"" Haider says. ""I've never forgotten Dr. Hudgins. And I will never forget you for the rest of my life.""

Nurses bring Noor a mannequin on which to practice catheterizing herself. Keenly aware of her own history, she calls the doll ""Baby Noor.""

Again, Haider pauses before asking the question.

""Is there any hope of her walking?""

The room falls silent. Noor looks away, as she's prone to do when she is the subject of serious talk. She reaches out to Ghufran and wants to chat about other things.

""I have been waiting for you to ask me that,"" Ssenyonga says. He, like Hudgins was years ago, is direct with Haider.

""No. She will not walk.""

He explains that Noor's brain is unable to make a connection with her legs because her spinal cord did not fully form.

""But they told me in America that there might be a technique in the future that could help her,"" Haider says, desperate to hear a different answer.

""That is the hope everyone has,"" Ssenyonga says.

""Inshallah,"" Haider says. God willing.

I can tell Haider is trying hard to hide the disappointment crushing him inside. One day, he believes, God will intervene. One day, when she is fully grown and her bones are strong, she will walk.

The doctors told him to discard his daughter. He didn't listen then, and he is not willing to listen now.

Everything he does is for Noor. She is his hope and future.

Close to heaven

On my last day with Noor, we take a Toyota Land Cruiser up to Mount Elgon, a volcanic outcrop that soars some 14,000 feet high above the border between Uganda and Kenya. Noor has never climbed a mountain, or even seen one.

We get out of the car at a tourist lodge near Sipi Falls, and Haider takes turns with a couple of guides to carry Noor up a winding dirt path.

Haider carries Noor up to a waterfall at Mount Elgon. She had never been atop a mountain before.

At the top, Noor gazes out from her wheelchair, mesmerized by a waterfall crashing down on the rocks below. She watches her father frolic in pristine pools.

I crouch next to her and a silvery mist clings to our hair and skin. This is the highest ground Noor has ever touched, the closest to heaven she's ever been.

""It's beautiful here,"" she says. ""I don't want to go back home.""

How different it is here from Baghdad, I think, where even life's simple pleasures often seem so far out of reach, where every day unfolds with uncertainty.

""Will you come visit me in Baghdad?"" Noor asks.

""Of course,"" I say, knowing well that many months, maybe years, may pass before we meet again. I can only hope it will be joy and not calamity that brings us back together.

We sit for tea on an outdoor bench under amassing clouds burdened with rain. Before we lose the day's light, we start our descent back to the hospital in Mbale.

Ahead in the distance, far from the herky-jerky highway, there is something else Noor has never seen before: a rainbow spanning the sky.",

K.S. Narendran and his wife, Chandrika Sharma, planned to build a dream house in the Nilgiri Hills in India.

Story highlights K.S. Narendran's wife, Chandrika Sharma, was one of 239 people aboard MH370 He's deeply disappointed the search for the plane was suspended He struggles to go on with life without knowing what happened

(CNN) —

This time, the terrible news came in an email.

At least it wasn’t a text, like the hasty, solitary line that exploded K.S. Narendran’s world almost three years ago: “We deeply regret that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived.”

His wife of 25 years, Chandrika Sharma, was one of the 239 people aboard the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing on March 8, 2014.

On Tuesday, Narendran learned the search for the missing plane had been suspended. He saw the email a little before noon at his home in the southeastern Indian city of Chennai.

“An email is an improvement over an SMS message,” he posted on Facebook. “So, small mercies in an otherwise difficult period.”

Courtesy K.S. Narendran K.S. Narendran is no closer to knowing what happened to his wife, a passenger on MH370.

Then came the media requests for interviews. India Today, BBC, The Guardian, Deutsche Welle, NPR. He had become a spokesman for the MH370 families. After a group statement on the search suspension was made public, every journalist wanted to know Narendran’s reaction.

He expressed deep disappointment that the search was over. Anger that the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia had not followed a recent recommendation to search another 25,000 square kilometers north of the last search area. And betrayal: Those governments, he said, had made a commitment to the families of the lost passengers, and now they were reneging.

“I sensed my faith in the search and investigation erode precipitously, indeed faith in the entire gamut of institutional arrangements in place globally to keep us safe and secure, reassured that the journeys we undertake will indeed take us to our chosen destinations,” he wrote on Facebook.

“MH370 didn’t make it to Beijing. And we may never know why it didn’t. We can never be sure that there will not be another tragedy.”

The day seemed not to end. A flurry of emotions led to many moments of futility. Suspending the search was in part a message that the world was asking him to move on. As though he could.

The next morning, he boarded a plane for a business trip to Mumbai on India’s west coast. After MH370, Narendran developed a dread for planes. Sometimes in his seat, he role-plays and goes to a dark place. What was the experience like for his wife?

Courtesy K.S. Narendran Narendran met his wife in college and the two were married for 25 years.

The question consumes him to the point where he, an articulate man with considerable language skills, finds himself at a loss for words. He has to virtually kick himself out of that state and force himself to sleep. It’s his only way out.

“I don’t even wait for the plane’s doors to close,” he tells me. “I just try to sleep.”

I first spoke with Narendran a few days after MH370 vanished from the skies. I reached out to him after a mutual friend showed me his Facebook posts, and we have been in touch ever since.

RELATED: One man’s quiet reckoning on Flight 370

This time, we talk two days after he learned of the decision to stop the search. I want to ask him many things, but first he analyzes the mystery of the missing plane. He doesn’t understand why the search was called off when debris – confirmed to be from MH370 – had been found off the coast of southern Africa.

“Common sense would suggest they would be hurrying to go and look there,” he says. “It is really puzzling. I have wracked my brain all this time on why then have been such a laggard on this front.”

That leaves him wondering whether there is truth to conspiracy theories that suggest a cover-up.

“Maybe they know more than what was said and they want a closure to this investigation,” he says.

I can hear the frustration in his voice. I can hear the exhaustion.

I ask him about a difficult question a radio interviewer posed the day before: “Have you been able to have any kind of ceremony for her – funeral?”

He attempted to answer: “We have had no ceremony. It’s hard to think of one when you don’t know … when was the end? Where was the end?”

Narendran and I have discussed this several times in our many conversations via phone, Skype, email and even in person at a Bangalore coffee house. He said in the past that his family and friends suggested some sort of memorial to help him let go, move forward, bring closure and all those clichéd things we say after loss.

RELATED: Missing plane mystery: A hole in the clouds, an empty space on earth

The truth is he doesn’t take kindly to rituals and besides, he wouldn’t even know how to begin planning such a ceremony. It would drain his energy, he tells me. And for what?

How do you say goodbye to the person you loved most – without knowing?

In the summer of 2015, he initiated the process of obtaining a death certificate for Chandrika. The pragmatic part of him said it was needed to settle insurance policies, bank accounts, property matters and other assets his wife held.

All he really had was a message from Malaysia Airlines confirming Chandrika was a passenger on the missing plane. A death certificate would provide documentation.

But it has to be issued by a court in Kuala Lumpur, and he is still waiting. One of his unsavory chores is to keep writing to ask about the status, and it adds to a host of other reminders.

They include the daily walks he used to take with Chandrika. After she was gone, he often imagined conversations with the woman he met in college and had shared life’s joys and disappointments with.

Where have you been, Chandrika?

Oh, many places. All at the same time. Can you believe that?

When will you be back?

Your guess is as good as mine.

For good. That is.

What if I am gone for good?

He fantasized about new facts being unearthed that might provide incontrovertible evidence. Then he could say: Case closed, like the ending of a Sherlock Holmes story. Time to move on.

RELATED: Dear Chandrika: Conversations with my missing wife

But those facts never came, and for almost three years now, Narendran has lived life with crushing uncertainty. There were days that were more jarring than others: when the missing plane was in the news, when debris was found, when the first anniversary came and then the second. And now, the end of the search.

But to him, day 364 was the same as day 365. It was another day without her.

I sense that perhaps Narendran has begun to move on, however slow the progress. I ask him if he still speaks with his wife.

“My conversations lately have been with myself,” he says. “What I wish to do with my life. And I don’t think I have answers yet.”

Nor has the uncertainty abated as much as he would have liked.

One reason, he surmises, is his role as spokesman for Voice 370, the support group for families of the missing.

“That role travels with me 24 hours a day,” he says. “It has a way of keeping alive the questions and continues the agonizing. I think the questions about finding answers, finding an explanation that is credible enough, sufficiently substantiated, remains very important.

“Why? I have often asked myself the same question. And I don’t think I have a very clear answer. The sense of incredulity about all that’s happened doesn’t just go away. That something like this should ever have happened where there is neither a trace nor understanding or explanation of how this might have happened is very deeply disturbing.”

Then there all the relatives and friends who constantly ask him questions or want an update. “Tell me what is happening,” they say.

“There is always this underlying assumption that the families know something more than the rest of the world. And we don’t,” he says.

So it remains unfinished business.

“I also frankly believe there are larger questions of fairness, justice, accountability that can’t be so easily put away,” he says. “There are levels of agitation and I tell myself: I can’t just let this pass. I can’t get on with life. I have not flushed my system of MH370.”

These are the sorts of things Narendran is often not asked about in the myriad interviews he gives. How do you even begin in a 5-minute radio or TV segment? But I have learned about him over the course of our acquaintance.

From the beginning, I felt his strength in the quietness of his voice and the power of his words. He is someone who doesn’t always emote outwardly – I’ve never heard him cry, although on several occasions he has brought tears to my eyes.

He tells me that writing about MH370 and his life without Chandrika has helped him enormously. It has forced him to learn about himself.

People who suffer great pain or sorrow often find refuge in prayer and hope. Many of the families of MH370 held onto the hope that everyone on that plane was still alive. That included some of Narendan’s relatives.

But Narendran was not one of them. He found comfort in his writing. It helps him gain insight on how he has been dealing with life after tragedy.

The eye cannot see itself, he tells me, quoting Shakespeare. “I need to hear from others on how they see me and then reflect back on what resonates with me.”

We end our conversation there. What I don’t tell him is that I can see he has already done a lot of reflection; that he’s already come a long way in his recovery. The search for the missing plane may have ended Tuesday, but what continues is Narendran’s quest to find himself again.",2017-01-22 00:00:00

(CNN) —

Blame President Trump for his tepid moral response. Call the neo-Nazis and white nationalists thugs. Fill your Facebook and Twitter accounts with moral outrage.

But the tragedy that took place in Charlottesville this month could not have occurred without the tacit acceptance of millions of ordinary, law-abiding Americans who helped create such a racially explosive climate, some activists, historians and victims of extremism say.

It’s easy to focus on the angry white men in paramilitary gear who looked like they were mobilizing for a race war in the Virginia college town. But it’s the ordinary people – the voters who elected a reality TV star with a record of making racially insensitive comments, the people who move out of the neighborhood when people of color move in, the family members who ignore a relative’s anti-Semitism – who give these type of men room to operate, they say.

That was the twisted formula that made the Holocaust and Rwanda possible and allowed Jim Crow segregation to survive: Nice people looked the other way while those with an appetite for violence did the dirty work, says Mark Naison, a political activist and history professor at Fordham University in New York City.

”You have to have millions of people who are willing to be bystanders, who push aside evidence of racism, Islamophobia or sexism. You can’t have one without the other,” Naison says.

“We are a country with a few million passionate white supremacists – and tens of millions of white supremacists by default,” he says.

Many people prefer to focus on the usual suspects after a Charlottesville happens – the violent racial extremists who are so easy to condemn. Yet there are four types of ordinary people who also play a part in the country’s racial divisions, Naison and others say:

No. 1: The ‘down-low’ segregationists

Many of the white racists who marched in Charlottesville were condemned because they openly said they don’t believe in integration or racial equality.

But millions of ordinary white Americans have been sending that message to black and brown people for at least a half a century.

They send it with their actions: They don’t want to live next to or send their children to school with black or brown people, historians say.

Busing, a nationwide campaign to end school segregation by shipping students of color to white schools, collapsed in large part because of fierce opposition by white parents. “White flight” – white families fleeing city neighborhoods after people of color moved in – helped create the modern suburbs.

Boston Globe/Getty Images Think only white supremacists oppose integration? These ordinary white Boston parents protested busing in 1974.

This isn’t the Jim Crow segregation that one reads about in the history books. It’s the covert or “down-low” segregationist movement that has shaped much of contemporary America since overt racism became taboo in the 1960s, says David Billings, who wrote about growing up white in the segregated South in his memoir, “Deep Denial: The Persistence of White Supremacy in United States History and Life.”

“Across the country, white people withdrew from the ‘public’ sphere and migrated to ‘whites only’ suburbs to evade racial integration,” Billings wrote. “The word ‘public’ preceding words like ‘housing,’ ‘hospital,’ ‘health care,’ ‘transportation,’ ‘defender,’ ‘schools,’ and even ‘swimming pool’ in some parts of the country became code words that meant poor and most often black and Latino. The word ‘private’ began to mean ‘better.”’

This white separatism continues today. Whites move out so often when nonwhites move in that sociologists have a name for the phenomenon. It’s called “racial tipping.”

This separation also occurs in the private lives of many white Americans, according to one pollster. In 2013, Robert Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, made a splash after conducting a survey where he found that 75% of whites in the United States didn’t have a single person of color in their social circle – they only had white friends.

Jones polled a complex subject. Many people of color self-segregate as well, and some American neighborhoods are so segregated that residents never come in contact with people of other racial or ethnic groups.

We are a country with a few million passionate white supremacists – and tens of millions of white supremacists by default. Mark Naison, a political activist and history professor at Fordham University

Yet some white Americans are driven by the same impulses that drove some of the white racists in Charlottesville – racial separation.

“White people in the past century and a half have made a conscious effort to resegregate themselves,” says Edward Ball, author of “Slaves in the Family,” a memoir about coming to terms with learning his family owned slaves.

“We have to work hard to make our social lives reflect our values, because white people do not choose the company of people of color generally,” he says.

Ball once wrote that “unconsciously or inadvertently, all of us white folks participate in forms of supremacist thought and activity.”

The angry white men in Charlottesville were just being open about their white supremacy. Ball says he wasn’t surprised by their boldness.

“Their climate is now better for them,” he says.

No. 2: Those who say ‘yes, but…’

President Trump’s critics blasted him for not coming out strong enough against the white racists who marched in Charlottesville. Trump initially denounced the “egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.” It was the “many sides” qualifier that infuriated some people. They wanted an unequivocal denunciation of racism from a leader.

Trump’s “many sides” response, though, wasn’t that abnormal in the context of US history. It used to be the norm for white political leaders to draw a moral equivalence between racists and those who suffered from their acts of brutality, historians say.

It’s the “yes, but” rhetorical maneuver – condemn racism but add a qualifier to diminish the sincerity of what you just said.

Archive Photos Creative/Getty Images White families fleeing people of color helped create suburban America. It's called ""white flight.""

The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ran into this “yes, but” response so much that he wrote about it in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail.”

He wrote:

“I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens’ Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace, which is the absence of tension, to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action…’”

President Dwight Eisenhower took the “yes, but” approach when he complained he couldn’t move too fast to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision to integrate schools because people had to respect the Southern way of life, says Carol Anderson, author of “White Rage” and a professor of African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta.

A recent Washington Post article gave other examples: When Southern governors like Orval Faubus of Arkansas and Earl Long of Louisiana were pressured in the 1950s to end segregation, they called both the NAACP and the White Citizens’ Councils, a rabid segregationist group, “extremists.”

RHS/AP The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once said moderate whites who refused to take a stand on racial justice angered him more than the KKK.

“You get that equivocation,” says Anderson, “that trying to make a system that absolutely strips people of their humanity on par with people demanding their humanity.”

That “yes, but” approach is often used today to discredit the grievances of the Black Lives Matter movement, another professor says. Whenever an unarmed black or brown person is shot by police, some deflect the issue by saying, “Yes, but all lives matter.”

“When a police officer shoots an unarmed black person, even then it’s controversial to say racism is a factor,” says Erik Love, a sociologist at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. “We say, ‘Why don’t we talk about these other issues. What about the crime rate, what police officers need to protect themselves.’ And suddenly we’re not talking about race anymore.”

No. 3: Those who choose chaos

There’s a famous line from the classic film, “Casablanca.” A police officer is closing down a casino, declaring, “I’m shocked – shocked – to find that gambling is going on in here!” – all while pocketing his casino winnings as they’re being handed to him on the sly.

That line could apply to Trump supporters who say they’re frustrated by the President’s statements on race since Charlottesville erupted.

How could you be shocked?

“This is who he is, this is what he does,” says Anderson, the Emory University professor. “‘Mexicans are rapists and criminals.’ That’s what he said in his first speech. Their complicity comes in the form of self-denial instead of owning it.”

For those who say they voted for Trump despite his intolerance, Anderson offers this analogy: Minister Louis Farrakhan.

Farrakhan is a leader in some parts of the black community because of his message of self-help and black empowerment. He reached peak popularity in the 1990s, but he also preached anti-Semitic, anti-white, anti-Catholic and anti-homosexual rhetoric. And the organization he leads, the Nation of Islam, has taught that white people are inherently evil.

Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times/Redux Fordham professor Mark Naison says America is at a scary place now where open, communal warfare could erupt.

“If he was running for office and black people voted in droves for him, the narrative would be, ‘They’re supporting a racist,”’ she says.

Ta-Nehisi Coates, an acclaimed writer on race relations, made a similar argument after Trump’s election in an interview with Vox’s Ezra Klein, where he responded to commentators who said not all white voters who supported Trump endorsed all of his ideas.

“As my buddy said, is that what you said to the followers of Louis Farrakhan? No, nobody says that to the followers of Louis Farrakhan. No, they blasted him as an anti-Semite, which he is, and say, ‘how can people follow this bigoted message?’ That’s the ultimate testament – that you could be Donald Trump and be President. There is no black person who could have the kind of vices Donald Trump has and, hell, be governor. Maybe you could be mayor somewhere.”

Many voters knew Trump would bring something else to the Oval Office – chaos. That’s why they chose him. He’s their first reality TV president, one writer says.

Many voted for Trump because they liked the persona he cultivated as the star of “The Apprentice.” Reality TV rewards characters who say rude and reprehensible things, characters are often cast as racial stereotypes, and those who provoke the most chaos get the most attention, says Joy Lanzendorfer, author of the Vice article, “How Reality TV Made Donald Trump President.”

“He would say horrible things about people, act out and break the rules, but people weirdly respected it,” she says. “They said he was a winner, and that’s how a winner wins.”

It’s not, however, how many would want a nation’s leader to handle a racial crisis.

No. 4: Those who look the other way

Ari Kohen knows something about the cost of hate. When he looked at images of neo-Nazis chanting “Jews will not replace us!” in Charlottesville, he thought of his grandfather, Zalman Kohen. He was living in rural Romania in 1944 when the Nazis rounded him up with the help of his neighbors and sent him to a death camp.

His grandfather survived, moved to the United States and lived until he was 90. But he never returned to Romania, says Kohen, an associate professor of political science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

This is who he is, this is what he does. ‘Mexicans are rapists and criminals.’ That’s what he said in his first speech. Their complicity comes in the form of self-denial instead of owning it. Carol Anderson, author of ""White Rage,"" on Trump voters who expressed dismay at his conduct after Charlottesville

“He could never forgive his neighbors,” he says. “These were people who, maybe they didn’t love Jews, but these were people who lived next to each other. They knew his family and he knew their family. The idea that they could all stand by while life was completely and forever changed for large portions of their community – he could never understand it.”

Many scholars have been vexed by the same question. When they examine genocidal events like the Holocaust, many come to the same conclusion:

Never underestimate the ability of ordinary people to look away.

Some do it with family members. Kohen says the hundreds of white racists who descended on Charlottesville must have family or friends who noticed their behavior beforehand. He suspects that some refused to confront them.

“There’s this wink and nod, everyone knows that this person is going down a dangerous path and people passively go along with it,” he says. “They don’t want to rock the boat. This is family or a friend. It’s hard to distance yourself from people you care about.”

Cliff Donaldson/Moment Editorial/Getty Images When ordinary people refuse to speak out, a country can descend into violence -- as it did in Northern Ireland.

This passivity extends to how people react when their country’s leaders become intolerant, others say. Once you see it coming, you have a duty to act, says Naison, the activist and Fordham professor.

“If you don’t speak up when this sort of ideology is being promoted at the highest level, you end up being complicit in the actions taken by its more extreme adherents,” Naison says. “Once the demons are unleashed, you’ve become a co-conspirator.”

Naison says he doesn’t think most Americans realize how dangerous it is in their country right now. He’s warned people who voted for Trump.

“I told these guys, you can’t control this; you’re playing with fire,” Naison says. “Open, violent communal warfare is scary. You can’t control it. Look at what happened in the Balkans, Northern Ireland, Israel.”

There’s also evidence, though, that millions of ordinary Americans from all walks of life don’t want that kind of America. Heather Heyer, the demonstrator who lost her life in Charlottesville, was a young white woman who marched in solidarity with black protesters. Millions of Americans have since taken to the streets or social media to stand against what happened there.

Former President Barack Obama even weighed in with a photo and quote that’s become the most liked tweet ever on Twitter.

Obama quoted Nelson Mandela, the South African leader who knew something about hate and reconciliation. In his 1994 autobiography “Long Walk to Freedom,” Mandela wrote:

“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.”

Yet to get to that place Mandela talked about, it may be necessary to not just look at the usual suspects people condemn when racial violence spills into public view.

If you want to know why those white racists now feel so emboldened, it may help to look at all the ordinary people around you, your neighbors, your family members, your leaders.

Bash: I can't repeat on TV what Gaetz's colleagues are telling me

(CNN) —

The NAACP has described itself as the “oldest and boldest” civil rights group in America, but it may soon tack on another word to its billing: “woke.”

The slang term, used to describe an unaware person who has become socially conscious, is how one national NAACP leader described the group’s recent metamorphosis. Others talked with unabashed excitement about the civil rights movement becoming “more militant” and “back to the streets.”

In-your-face rhetoric is not usually associated with the venerable NAACP. The 108-year-old organization has been like the Cadillac of civil rights groups – its name still has cachet, but people prefer newer models of activism. It’s been overshadowed by Black Lives Matter and accused of being obsolete.

The New York Public Library The Green Book, a pamphlet listing safe places to stay and eat for black drivers, was the black version of Triple-AAA during the Jim Crow era.

But something changed when a local NAACP official recently found a way to catapult the group back into the national spotlight. He issued a travel advisory for the state of Missouri, urging “extreme CAUTION” for any person of color traveling there. The advisory evoked the Green Book, a pamphlet that guided black motorists across the treacherous terrain of Jim Crow’s America. Reporters started asking if Missouri is the new Mississippi. And NAACP leaders seemed delighted.

“We were built for this moment,” says John Gaskin, a spokesman for the group’s St. Louis branch. “Cadillacs are built for the highways.”

Yet the story behind the story – why the NAACP came up with the advisory and what it says about a potentially seismic shift in the group’s philosophy – is as interesting as the advisory itself.

Over the top or on the mark?

Start with a basic question: Is the advisory really necessary, or is it a bit over the top?

Consider the history. This is the first time the NAACP has issued a travel advisory.

It was founded during a period of widespread lynching in the United States and didn’t issue one then.

Bettmann Archive/Getty Images The NAACP is known for its civil rights work in the legal arena. But will the legacy of NAACP giants like Thurgood Marshall, in center, matter much in the era of Black Lives Matter?

It didn’t issue one after four black girls were killed in a church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963.

It didn’t issue one when Medgar Evers, one of its most prominent leaders, was shot to death in front of his Mississippi home that same year.

It didn’t issue one when riots erupted across America after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. five years later.

Why now?

Nimrod “Rod” Chapel Jr., president of the NAACP’s Missouri State Conference, says he decided to issue the advisory after the state’s Legislature passed a law in June making it more difficult to sue for housing or job discrimination. The full NAACP subsequently adopted his advisory at its national convention.

Chapel says the Missouri law “is worse than Jim Crow in some ways.” As justification for the advisory, he also cited a report that said black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped by officers in Missouri than white drivers.

Some may say there goes a bunch of crazy kids. These are young folks who were concerned about their community, and they did something about it. That’s called activism. In the NAACP, there’s room for everybody, whether it’s Black Lives Matter or other people of conscience. Nimrod ""Rod"" Chapel Jr., president of the NAACP's Missouri State Conference, on the Black Lives Matter movement

“I don’t think we could have responsibly done anything less,” Chapel says. “We have a society in Missouri that has turned its back on morality. You cannot legalize discrimination and harassment, and they’ve done that by giving immunity to people who do it.”

Then there’s Missouri’s peculiar history. It’s where race riots erupted in 2014 in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson after a white police officer shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black youth, to death.

None of that, though, is enough to merit the group’s first travel advisory, one critic says.

Rick Moran, an editor with American Thinker, condemned the travel advisory in a recent column. He says it was much more dangerous driving while black in Jim Crow Mississippi than contemporary Missouri.

“The whole thing is nonsense,” Moran says. “It’s a fundraising gimmick. It just seems like that’s something you do when you’re sitting around the table and someone says, ‘Gee, we’re kind of low on fundraising, what can we do to goose that number?’ “

Gaskin, of the St. Louis NAACP, acknowledged that the type of racism in contemporary Missouri is not as lethal as other eras in American history. He cited the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers ambushed on a rural Mississippi road, which was depicted in the movie “Mississippi Burning.”

But that doesn’t mean the travel advisory isn’t merited, he says.

“Racism here in Missouri is hidden, and that can be the most devastating racism,” Gaskin says. “We’re not talking ‘Mississippi Burning’ racism. We’re talking about the sort of racism of being pulled over and asked additional questions that you might not be asked in Illinois. Folks on your street might not be so welcoming.”

The advisory may have done its job. It focused national attention on the state of Missouri and brought publicity to the NAACP, which only last month had been publicly blasted by a powerful group of black ministers for verging on irrelevance.

“The work of the NAACP is more important than ever before,” Gaskin says. “If it wasn’t relevant, this wouldn’t be the leading story of the last couple of days. That’s why this made the headlines – because this is the NAACP.”

National Museum of American History During the era of Jim Crow, highway travel could be treacherous for black families. Many dressed up for travel but packed their own food because they weren't allowed to eat at many restaurants.

And at least one historian who is an authority on driving while black during those “Mississippi Burning” days wasn’t offended by the travel advisory.

Calvin Ramsey wrote the play “The Green Book,” which traces the rise of the unofficial travel advisory that many blacks and Jews used during the Jim Crow era. He says he wasn’t surprised by the NAACP’s actions.

Calvin Ramsey explains how travel has changed since Jim Crow era

“I guess they’d rather be over the top than under the radar,” Ramsey says. “There’s a lot of raw nerves since [President Donald Trump’s] election. I thought that we had passed this in a lot of ways, but I was never totally convinced that we passed this completely.”

The notoriety the NAACP’s advisory attracted is a sign of progress, he says.

“We didn’t have a CNN before and people were out there on their own,” he says. “A lot of things happened that were never reported. The Green Book was our AAA guide because we couldn’t belong to AAA. It was a lifesaver.”

Glimpses of a new NAACP

The travel advisory also may hint at the NAACP’s new direction.

The group has gone through a rough patch. In May, it announced it would not renew the contract of its then-president, Cornell William Brooks. Its leaders called the decision part of a “transformational, systemwide refresh and strategic re-envisioning.”

In June, the group held its annual national convention, where leaders talked openly about trying to remain relevant. One writer, Michael A. Fletcher of ESPN, while covering the convention said the group’s traditional approach of working within legal and legislative channels for social change can now seem “ponderous or even irrelevant” because of the “raucous” demonstrations of groups like Black Lives Matter.

The whole thing is nonsense. It’s a fundraising gimmick. It just seems like that’s something you do when you’re sitting around the table and someone says, ‘Gee, we’re kind of low on fundraising, what can we do to goose that number?’ “ Rick Moran, conservative columnist on the NAACP's travel advisory for the state of Missouri

And just weeks before the convention, a group of black ministers released a blistering open letter demanding that the NAACP change.

The African Methodist Episcopal Church’s Council of Bishops called on NAACP leaders to “restructure the organization” to avoid irrelevancy. The A.M.E. Church is a pillar in the black community and has provided many of the NAACP’s best-known leaders.

“Longevity alone is not proof of relevance,” the statement read. “For the reality is that today the NAACP is smaller and less influential than it has ever been in its history.”

How would a new NAACP look if it answered the challenge by the A.M.E. Church?

It may look a little more like Black Livers Matter.

Traditional civil rights group have been wary and critical of Black Lives Matter activists. The movement, which gives prominent places of power to women and members of the LGBT community, is run very differently than many civil rights groups. Traditional civil rights groups evolved out of the black church, which tended to be led by autocratic men who condemned gays and lesbians and didn’t see women as equals. Even today, some black churches still won’t allow women to preach and few officially affirm gay and lesbians.

Some of that wariness also may be rooted in generational differences. There have often been clashes between older civil rights leaders and the young folks they condemned for moving too fast and being too aggressive. Andrew Young, a close aide to King, once apologized after calling Black Lives Matter activists “unlovable little brats.”

Now, however, at least some NAACP leaders are talking about Black Lives Matter activists as potential allies, not rivals.

Chapel, the Missouri NAACP official who issued the travel advisory, says he admires Black Lives Matter.

“Some may say there goes a bunch of crazy kids,” he says. “These are young folks who were concerned about their community, and they did something about it. That’s called activism. In the NAACP, there’s room for everybody, whether it’s Black Lives Matter or other people of conscience.”

The NAACP has lasted a long time for a reason. There’s a risk when you copy the latest flavor. You risk losing your core constituency. Shayne Lee, University of Houston sociologist

Anthony Davis, national coordinator for the college and youth division of the NAACP, is a fan as well.

“I love it,” he says. “As a result of the Black Lives Matter movement, the social justice and civil rights movement has been able to become more militant. It’s OK to be back in the streets. We would love to partner and work with Black Lives Matter because we appreciate them for what they do.”

Davis says the NAACP is already adjusting its outreach to younger people. He says it’s creating more engaging platforms on social media to attract youth and touring with hip-hop stars to register voters for the 2018 midterms.

“Over the last year, we’ve done a good job branding ourselves as not only this historic civil rights group, but the youth and college division is more hip and, I hate to use this term, but, ‘woke,’ ” Davis says.

Becoming more like Black Lives Matter, though, might not be good for the NAACP, one sociologist says. He says the group lacks structure and long-term vision. The Black Lives Matter movement has also been weakened by infighting.

“The NAACP has lasted a long time for a reason,” says Shayne Lee, a sociologist with the University of Houston. “There’s a risk when you copy the latest flavor. You risk losing your core constituency.”

The Missouri travel advisory may mark a new direction for the NAACP, but the kind of leader the group chooses next may serve as the ultimate proof of a new “woke” NAACP.

Gaskin, the St. Louis NAACP leader, sounds confident.

Some in the black community, he says, were asleep during the last eight years while Barack Obama was President. Now they’re in the Trump era, and they’re taking a second look at the NAACP.

“At that time, they didn’t think they needed us,” he says. “You don’t miss water until your well dries.”

The next few months and years will show if the group can not only be “bold,” “old” and “woke,” but do something else:

"When exorcists need help, they call him","(CNN) A small group of nuns and priests met the woman in the chapel of a house one June evening. Though it was warm outside, a palpable chill settled over the room.

As the priests began to pray, the woman slipped into a trance -- and then snapped to life. She spoke in multiple voices: One was deep, guttural and masculine; another was high-pitched; a third spouted only Latin. When someone secretly sprinkled ordinary water on her, she didn't react. But when holy water was used, she screamed in pain.

""Leave her alone, you f***ing priests,"" the guttural voice shouted. ""Stop, you whores. ... You'll be sorry.""

You've probably seen this before: a soul corrupted by Satan, a priest waving a crucifix at a snarling woman. Movies and books have mimicked exorcisms so often, they've become clichés.

The 1973 film ""The Exorcist"" shaped how many see demonic possession.

But this was an actual exorcism -- and included a character not normally seen in the traditional drive-out-the-devil script.

Dr. Richard Gallagher is an Ivy League-educated, board-certified psychiatrist who teaches at Columbia University and New York Medical College. He was part of the team that tried to help the woman.

Fighting Satan's minions wasn't part of Gallagher's career plan while he was studying medicine at Yale. He knew about biblical accounts of demonic possession but thought they were an ancient culture's attempt to grapple with mental disorders like epilepsy. He proudly calls himself a ""man of science.""

Yet today, Gallagher has become something else: the go-to guy for a sprawling network of exorcists in the United States. He says demonic possession is real. He's seen the evidence: victims suddenly speaking perfect Latin; sacred objects flying off shelves; people displaying ""hidden knowledge"" or secrets about people that they could not have possibly have known.

""There was one woman who was like 90 pounds soaking wet. She threw a Lutheran deacon who was about 200 pounds across the room,"" he says. ""That's not psychiatry. That's beyond psychiatry.""

Gallagher calls himself a ""consultant"" on demonic possessions. For the past 25 years, he has helped clergy distinguish between mental illness and what he calls ""the real thing."" He estimates that he's seen more cases of possession than any other physician in the world.

There was one woman who was like 90 pounds soaking wet. She threw a Lutheran deacon who was about 200 pounds across the room. That's not psychiatry. That's beyond psychiatry. Dr. Richard Gallagher, psychiatrist, professor and demonic possession ""consultant""

""Whenever I need help, I call on him,"" says the Rev. Gary Thomas, one of the most famous exorcists in the United States. The movie ""The Rite"" was based on Thomas' work.

""He's so respected in the field,"" Thomas says. ""He's not like most therapists, who are either atheists or agnostics.""

Gallagher is a big man -- 6-foot-5 -- who once played semipro basketball in Europe. He has a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor. When he talks about possession, it sounds as if he's describing the growth of algae; his tone is dry, clinical, matter-of-fact.

Possession, he says, is rare -- but real.

""I spend more time convincing people that they're not possessed than they are,"" he wrote in an essay for The Washington Post.

Some critics, though, say Gallagher has become possessed by his own delusions. They say all he's witnessed are cheap parlor tricks by people who might need therapy but certainly not exorcism. And, they argue, there's no empirical evidence that proves possession is real.

Still, one of the biggest mysteries about Gallagher's work isn't what he's seen. It's how he's evolved.

How does a ""man of science"" get pulled into the world of demonic possession?

His short answer: He met a queen of Satan.

A 'creepy' encounter with evil

She was a middle-age woman who wore flowing dark clothes and black eye shadow. She could be charming and engaging. She was also part of a satanic cult.

She called herself the queen of the cult, but Gallagher would refer to her as ""Julia,"" the pseudonym he gave her.

The woman had approached her local priest, convinced she was being attacked by a demon. The priest referred her to an exorcist, who reached out to Gallagher for a mental health evaluation.

Why, though, would a devil worshipper want to be free of the devil?

""She was conflicted,"" Gallagher says. ""There was a part of her that wanted to be relieved of the possession.""

She ended up relieving Gallagher of his doubts. It was one of the first cases he took, and it changed him. Gallagher helped assemble an exorcism team that met Julia in the chapel of a house.

Objects would fly off shelves around her. She somehow knew personal details about Gallagher's life: how his mother had died of ovarian cancer; the fact that two cats in his house went berserk fighting each other the night before one of her sessions.

Julia found a way to reach him even when she wasn't with him, he says.

He was talking on the phone with Julia's priest one night, he says, when both men heard one of the demonic voices that came from Julia during her trances -- even though she was nowhere near a phone and thousands of miles away.

He says he was never afraid.

""It's creepy,"" he says. ""But I believe I'm on the winning side.""

How a scientist believes in demons

He also insists that he's on the side of science.

He says he's a stickler for the scientific method, that it teaches people to follow the facts wherever they may lead.

Growing up in a large Irish Catholic family in Long Island, he didn't think much about stories of possession. But when he kept seeing cases like Julia's as a professional, he says, his views had to evolve.

Some priests say those who dabble in the occult are opening doorways to the demonic.

""I don't believe in this stuff because I'm Catholic,"" he says. ""I try to follow the evidence.""

Being Catholic, though, may help.

Gallagher grew up in a home where faith was taken seriously. His younger brother, Mark, says Gallagher was an academic prodigy with a photographic memory who wanted to use his faith to help people.

""We had a sensational childhood,"" Mark Gallagher says. ""My mother and father were great about always helping neighbors or relatives out."" Their mother was a homemaker, and their father was a lawyer who'd fought in World War II. ""My father used to walk us proudly into church. He taught us to give back.""

Gallagher's two ways of giving back -- helping the mentally ill as well as the possessed -- may seem at odds. But not necessarily for those in the Catholic Church.

Contemporary Catholicism doesn't see faith and science as contradictory. Its leaders insist that possession, miracles and angels exist. But global warming is real, so is evolution, and miracles must be documented with scientific rigor.

More from 'The Other Side' Some stories blur the lines between science, spirituality and the supernatural. These stories are from ""The Other Side."" Where do coincidences come from?

Synchronicity is familiar to many people, yet few understand how it works. Are our lives are shaped by unseen hands? Or are we victims of psychological narcissm? Beyond Goodbye

Popular culture is filled with accounts from people who claim to have near-death experiences. So why doesn't the church talk about heaven anymore? Bidding farewell from beyond the grave?

Although visits by the spirits of the recently departed can be chilling, they are also comforting, say those who've seen these ""crisis apparitions."" Can bonds between loved ones defy death?

One of Gallagher's favorite sources of inspiration is Pope John Paul II's encyclical ""Fides et Ratio"" (""On Faith and Reason""). The Pope writes that ""there can never be a true divergence between faith and reason, since the same God who reveals the mysteries and bestows the gift of faith has also placed in the human spirit the light of reason.""

The church's emphasis on faith and reason can even been seen in the birth of its exorcism ritual.

The Rite of Exorcism was first published in 1614 by Pope Paul V to quell a trend of laypeople and priests hastily performing exorcisms on people they presumed were possessed, such as victims of the bubonic plague, says the Rev. Mike Driscoll, author of ""Demons, Deliverance, Discernment: Separating Fact from Fiction about the Spirit World.""

""A line (in the rite) said that the exorcist should be careful to distinguish between demon possession and melancholy, which was a catchall for mental illness,"" Driscoll says. ""The church knew back then that there were mental problems. It said the exorcist should not have anything to do with medicine. Leave that to the doctors.""

Doctors, perhaps, like Gallagher.

Gallagher says the concept of possession by spirit isn't limited to Catholicism. Muslim, Jewish and other Christian traditions regard possession by spirits -- holy or benign -- as possible.

""This is not quite as esoteric as some people make it out to be,"" Gallagher says. ""I know quite a few psychiatrists and mental health professionals who believe in this stuff.""

Dr. Mark Albanese is among them. A friend of Gallagher's, Albanese studied medicine at Cornell and has been practicing psychiatry for decades. In a letter to the New Oxford Review, a Catholic magazine, he defended Gallagher's belief in possession.

He also says there is a growing belief among health professionals that a patient's spiritual dimension should be accounted for in treatment, whether their provider agrees with those beliefs or not. Some psychiatrists have even talked of adding a ""trance and possession disorder"" diagnosis to the DSM, the premier diagnostic manual of disorders used by mental health professionals in the US.

There's still so much about the human mind that psychiatrists don't know, Albanese says. Doctors used to be widely skeptical of people who claimed to suffer from multiple personalities, but now it's a legitimate disorder (dissociative identity disorder). Many are still dumbfounded by the power of placebos, a harmless pill or medical procedure that produces healing in some cases.

""There's a certain openness to experiences that are happening that are beyond what we can explain by MRI scans, neurobiology or even psychological theories,"" Albanese says.

Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, a psychiatrist who specializes in schizophrenia, arrived at a similar conclusion after he had an unnerving experience with a patient.

Lieberman was asked to examine the videotape of an exorcism that he subsequently dismissed as unconvincing.

Then he met a woman who, he said, ""freaked me out.""

Lieberman, director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, says he and a family therapist were asked to examine a young woman who some thought was possessed. He and his colleague tried to treat the woman for several months but gave up because they had no success.

The film ""The Rite"" is based on the life of the Rev. Gary Thomas, one of the leading exorcists in the US.

Something happened during the treatment, though, that he still can't explain. After sessions with the woman, he says, he'd go home in the evenings, and the lights in his house would go off by themselves, photographs and artwork would fall or slide off shelves, and he'd experience a piercing headache.

When he mentioned to this to his colleague one day, her response stunned him: She'd been having the exact same experiences.

""I had to sort of admit that I didn't really know what was going on,"" Lieberman says. ""Because of the bizarre things that occurred, I wouldn't say that (demonic possession) is impossible or categorically rule it out ... although I have very limited empirical evidence to verify its existence.""

The tragic case of the real 'Emily Rose'

If you want to know why so many scientists and doctors like Lieberman are cautious about legitimizing demonic possession, consider one name: Anneliese Michel.

Michel was a victim in one of the most notorious cases of contemporary exorcism. If you have the stomach for it, go online and listen to audiotapes and watch videos of her exorcisms. The images and sounds will burn themselves into your brain. It sounds like somebody dropped a microphone into hell.

Michel was a German Catholic woman who died of starvation in 1976 after 67 exorcisms over a period of nine months. She was diagnosed with epilepsy but believed she was possessed. So did her devout Roman Catholic parents. She reportedly displayed some of the classic signs of possession: abnormal strength, aversion to sacred objects, speaking different languages.

But authorities later determined that it was Michel's parents and two priests who were responsible for her death. German authorities put them on trial for murder, and they were found guilty of negligent homicide. The 2005 film ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" was based on Michel's ordeal and the subsequent trial.

The worst thing you can do to a patient who is delusional is to confirm their delusions. Telling a patient who is struggling that maybe they're possessed by a demon is the worst thing you can do. Steven Novella, a neurologist and professor at Yale School of Medicine

One of the leading skeptics of exorcism -- and one of Gallagher's chief critics -- is Steven Novella, a neurologist and professor at Yale School of Medicine.

He wrote a lengthy blog post dissecting Gallagher's experience with Julia, the satanic priestess. It could be read as a takedown of exorcisms everywhere.

He says Julia probably performed a ""cold reading"" on Gallagher. It's an old trick of fortune tellers and mediums in which they use vague, probing statements to make canny guesses about someone. (Fortune teller: ""I see a recent tragedy in your family."" Client: ""You mean my sister who got hurt in a car accident? How did you know?"")

Or take the case of a person speaking an unfamiliar language like Latin during a possession.

""A patient might memorize Latin phrases to throw out during one of their possessions,"" Novella wrote. ""Were they having a conversation in Latin? Did they understand Latin spoken to them? Or did they just speak Latin?""

Novella says it's noteworthy that no one has filmed any paranormal event such as levitation or sacred objects flying across the room during an exorcism. He's seen exorcism tapes posted online and in documentaries and says they're not scary.

""They're boring,"" he says. ""Nothing exciting happens. The most you get is some really bad play-acting by the person who is being exorcised.""

In an interview, Novella went further and criticized any therapist who believes his patient's delusions.

""The worst thing you can do to a patient who is delusional is to confirm their delusions,"" says Novella, who founded the New England Skeptical Society.

""The primary goal of therapy is to reorient them to reality. Telling a patient who is struggling that maybe they're possessed by a demon is the worst thing you can do. It's only distracting them from addressing what the real problem is.""

The 2005 horror film ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" was loosely based on the death of Anneliese Michel.

Driscoll, the Catholic priest who wrote a book about possession, is not a skeptic like Novella. Still, he says, it's not unusual for people on drugs or during psychotic episodes to display abnormal strength.

""I have seen it take four grown guys to hold one small woman down,"" says Driscoll, a chaplain at St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Ottawa, Illinois. ""When a person has no fear and is not in their right mind and they don't care about hurting themselves or hurting others, you can see heartbreaking things.""

That doesn't mean he thinks possession isn't real. He says the New Testament is full of accounts of Jesus confronting demons.

""Do I still believe it happens? Yes, I do,"" he says. ""It happened then. I don't know why it would be totally eradicated now.""

Gallagher agrees and has answers for skeptics like Novella.

He says demons won't submit to lab studies or allow themselves to be easily recorded by video equipment. They want to sow doubt, not confirm their existence, he says. Nor will the church compromise the privacy of a person suffering from possession just to provide film to skeptics.

Gallagher says he sees his work with the possessed as an extension of his responsibilities as a doctor.

In a passage from a book he is working on about demonic possession in America, he says that it is the duty of a physician to help people in great distress ""without concern whether they have debatable or controversial conditions.""

Gallagher isn't the first psychiatrist to feel such duty. Dr. M. Scott Peck, the late author of ""The Road Less Traveled,"" conducted two exorcisms himself -- something Gallagher considers unwise and dangerous for any psychiatrist.

""I didn't go volunteering for this,"" he says. ""I went into this because different people over the last few decades realized that I was open to this sort of thing. The referrals are almost invariably from priests. It's not like someone is walking into my office and I say, 'You must be possessed.' ""

What happened to Satan's queen

He may not have asked to join the ""hidden"" world of exorcism, but he is an integral part of that community today. He's been featured in stories and documentaries about exorcism and is on the governing board of the Rome-based International Association of Exorcists.

""It's deepened my faith,"" he says of the exorcisms he's witnessed. ""It didn't radically change it, but it validated my faith.""

He says he's received thanks from many people he's helped over the years. Some wept, grateful to him for not dismissing them as delusional. As for letting a journalist talk to any of these people, Gallagher says he zealously guards their privacy.

Belief in possession exists in many religious traditions. Here, a man enters a state of possession during an African voodoo ceremony.

Julia, though, gave him permission to tell her story. But it didn't have a happy ending.

He and a team of exorcists continued to see her, but eventually, she called a halt to the sessions. She was too ambivalent. She relished some of the abilities she displayed during her trances. She was ""playing both sides.""

""Exorcism is not some kind of magical incantation,"" Gallagher says. ""Normally, a person has to make their own sincere spiritual efforts, too.""

About a year after she dropped out, Gallagher says, he heard Julia's voice on the phone again. This time, she had called to tell him she was dying of cancer.

Gallagher says he offered to try to help her with a team of priests while she was still physically able, but her response was terse:

""Well, I'll give it some thought.""

He says he never heard from her again.

Inevitably, there will be others. His phone will ring. A priest will tell him a story. A team of clergy and nuns will be summoned. And the man of science will enter the hidden world of exorcism again.

The critics, the souls that aren't saved, the creepy encounters -- they don't seem to deter him.

""Truly informed exorcists don't tend to get discouraged,"" he says, ""because they know it is our Lord who delivers the person, not themselves.""

Is Gallagher doing God's work, or does he need deliverance from his own delusions?

'Folks don't feel safe',"Winston-Salem, North Carolina (CNN) The protesters chant in English, then in Spanish, as they belt out their rallying cry.

""The people, united, will never be defeated!""

""El pueblo, unido, jamás será vencido!""

Winston-Salem's leaders are hours away from deciding whether to declare this a ""welcoming city"" for immigrants. And at a rally on the steps of City Hall, supporters of the measure are making their case one last time.

""Now do it in Arabic!"" someone shouts. Demonstrators cheer as a woman wearing a hijab approaches the microphone.

But then, everyone freezes. A counter-protester paces in front of them, briefly sending a chill through the crowd. Some people laugh. Others look stunned.

The woman is wearing a bright red T-shirt that says ""TRUMP 2016."" She has a matching sparkly flower in her hair.

She doesn't say anything. And she doesn't have to. The hand-written cardboard signs she's carrying make her message clear:

""President Trump says NO! Obey the Law!""

""A Sanctuary City is against the LAW of our land.""

Two views of the future

Valeria Rodriguez Cobos glares at the woman in the Trump T-shirt. She's frustrated to see her getting so much attention, even though the woman is far outnumbered by pro-immigrant protesters.

Rodriguez Cobos has been coming here for months as part of a group of activists pushing for Winston-Salem to become a sanctuary city. The 25-year-old's mission: using her voice for those who have none.

She has a green card, but most of her friends and family don't. And as she stands on the steps of City Hall tonight, she knows she's carrying the weight of thousands of people who need help, but aren't here simply because they're too scared to show up.

The neighbors who panicked when they saw a white van circling their apartment complex, terrified that ICE agents were about to swoop in. The children at her church who went running when police neared their playground. The friend who just asked her to take care of her kids if she gets deported.

The counter-protester winds her way into the building. A demonstrator waving a sign saying ""HUMAN RIGHTS"" follows close behind.

The crowd resumes chanting, louder than before.

A proposed resolution declaring Winston-Salem a ""welcoming city"" brought a contentious debate to City Hall and drew sharp criticism from state lawmakers.

From inside, Joan Fleming can hear them. And it's making her uneasy.

She thinks back to riots she lived through as a child growing up in the 1960s. Her father was a police officer then. She thought of him as she came to City Hall today, carrying an American flag tote bag stuffed with petitions. He raised her to respect the importance of law and order.

Back then, when violence flared during protests, she'd wait by the door of her family's home in Kinston, North Carolina. Every night she feared her father wouldn't make it back alive.

Now as she sits inside the City Council's meeting room, those fears have been replaced by new ones -- growing concerns about what Fleming believes could be just around the corner, and what she feels is lurking in plain sight.

She's already warned the City Council about what she fears will happen if they pass the ""welcoming city"" proposal: Felons will flock to Winston-Salem.

""There are thousands of chances per month for you or your loved one to be killed by a suspected illegal drunk driver,"" she told officials at last month's meeting.

Tonight she hopes they'll remember what she said.

Echoes of a larger fight

This was the scene on Monday, April 17, in one corner of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as a controversial vote loomed.

But it could be anywhere in America in 2017, as increasingly divisive debates over immigration expose feelings simmering beneath the surface.

President Donald Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a focal point of his administration.

He took steps to retaliate against so-called sanctuary cities, vowing to cut off funding to local governments that don't cooperate with the feds. He doubled down on his message that undocumented immigrants can be a danger to communities, creating an office focused on victims of immigrant crime

Critics say Trump is highlighting crime as a pretext for plans to kick out as many undocumented immigrants as possible, regardless of whether they pose a threat.

It's too soon to say whether these early numbers will translate into a trend.

But spend a day in this Southern city, where the salvos of national political battles echo loudly, and you'll see signs of a deepening shift beyond what's measured with statistics in spreadsheets.

Tensions are high. So are suspicions. And there's one thing both sides have in common: fear.

Sending a message

At first, Dan Besse thought his resolution declaring Winston-Salem a welcoming city would sail to approval.

The city already prides itself on being a place that's made immigrants feel at home. Industrial, manufacturing and construction jobs, plus a low cost of living, made Winston-Salem an attractive destination.

Besse is an attorney who's been on Winston-Salem's City Council since 2001. He thought his proposal wouldn't rock the boat much because it wasn't creating new rules or overturning any old ones. But he'd heard about mounting fears for immigrants in his city -- about parents who were too scared to take their children to doctor's appointments or leave them in after-school programs, about threats to local mosques.

And he wanted to send a symbolic message.

""A lot of folks don't feel safe,"" he said, ""and they really need this kind of reassurance that their local elected representatives are on their side.""

Dan Besse, a Democrat on Winston-Salem's City Council, saw his ""welcoming city"" resolution as a palatable compromise. Instead, it became a flashpoint for the national immigration debate.

So at a February meeting, Besse unveiled a resolution that he says intended to do just that. It was a compromise move that skirted the word ""sanctuary"" and some of the more controversial measures activists had proposed, such as a pledge to limit cooperation with federal law enforcement.

Among its proclamations: ""Whereas, the current national environment of excessive fear and suspicion directed by some toward immigrants, refugees, and other newcomers calls for cities like Winston-Salem to reaffirm our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all.""

In this left-leaning city with a City Council where seven of the eight members are Democrats, it was the kind of message that sounded like an easy sell.

Maybe a few years ago, or even a few months ago, it would have been.

Besse's proposal cleared a committee and seemed to be gaining steam among his colleagues. But it wasn't long before it sparked an uproar. First local Republicans rallied against it. Then state elected officials took aim.

At a meeting in Raleigh, they told Winston-Salem to bury the welcoming city measure or risk losing funding.

""There will be consequences if Winston-Salem does this,"" one state senator warned

'Like a rattlesnake'

As she gets ready for the vote, Joan Fleming sits at her kitchen table, staring at her laptop screen.

A wood carving of the continental United States hangs behind her, near metal sculpted into cursive lettering that says ""Faith"" and ""Love.""

A magnet on her refrigerator says, ""Friends don't let friends vote Democrat.""

The lifelong Republican is no stranger to rallying around a cause. Ever since she moved to Winston-Salem in 1990, she's worked for candidates and campaigns, from Sen. Jesse Helms' 1996 reelection battle to North Carolina's 2012 amendment banning same-sex marriage. As she sits at her computer and prepares for a vote she's very worried her side might lose, she glides her mouse across the elephant on her mousepad that says ""Grand Old Party.""

Fleming's phone rings. It's someone she hopes will be at tonight's meeting. And she wants to make sure they've signed her petition.

""I've put it on my Facebook about 2,500 times. If you haven't seen it, you must be living under a rock,"" she says. ""I don't know how to put it out there any other way.""

Joan Fleming says she can't understand why anyone would want to label Winston-Salem a welcoming city. ""I wonder their real reason for why they want to bring felons into our city and say it's the right thing to do,"" she says.

Beside her, she has copies of several recent arrest reports -- proof, she says, that being too lax about illegal immigration is endangering people in the area.

Is it unfair to paint an entire group based on the most severe crimes committed by a handful of people? Fleming doesn't think so. She suspects the amount of crime connected to illegal immigration is under-reported. And even one crime, she feels, is one crime too many.

""It's a life. It's a rape,"" she says. ""If we hadn't been negligent in letting them in here, it wouldn't have happened.""

She resents it when critics call her and others who oppose Winston-Salem's proposed welcoming city measure hateful or racist. Fleming says there's nothing hateful about supporting legal immigration and standing firmly against illegal immigration.

""I might like a rattlesnake,"" she says, ""but I don't want them in my living room. I lock my doors at night.""

If she were a few years younger, Fleming, who's in her 60s, says she'd head to the Mexican border and build the wall herself.

Collecting ammunition

Instead, Fleming is spending Monday afternoon on the road, driving around Winston-Salem's suburbs as she picks up copies of petitions. The vote is only a few hours away, and she knows every signature counts.

She heads down a hilly country road, past grazing horses and Baptist churches and an apartment complex called Plantation Place, to collect a stack of papers left for her. The petitions are on top of a Buick parked in a carport with a ""Make America Great Again"" bumper sticker.

She stops in a Chick-fil-A parking lot near a strip mall to get another stack from a friend who's fallen ill and won't be able to make it to tonight's meeting.

Fleming doesn't live inside the city limits. Her home is about a 20-minute drive away, near a golf course in Advance, North Carolina. But most of her family lives in the city. And Fleming says anything that happens inside Winston-Salem will spread.

Fleming's lived outside Winston-Salem for several years in suburban Advance, North Carolina. But she fears decisions the city makes will affect residents all over the region. ""What about the Americans?"" she says. ""Who's protecting us?""

She's heading to City Hall armed with a tote bag full of testimonials from others who share her views:

""I will no longer feel safe as a single female if this happens.""

""The safety of our city and our children is at stake.""

""Our city is being overrun with aliens. I notice my own neighborhood is being flooded with immigrants. ... I don't feel safe letting my grandchildren play outside unless I am with them. Not the America my children grew up in.""

Loud and clear

As they chant on the steps outside City Hall, the protesters are sending a very different message:

""No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all.""

""Fund educations, not deportations.""

""Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here.""

""Hey ya'll,"" Valeria Rodriguez Cobos says into the microphone, smiling at the crowd.

Rodriguez Cobos was only a year and a half old when her parents brought her to the United States from their home in Oaxaca, Mexico. For 22 years, she was undocumented. Like many of her family members, she lived in the shadows, terrified that the life she was trying to build could dissolve in an instant.

But the 25-year-old is a permanent resident now. Several years ago she was able to petition for legal residency under the Violence Against Women Act after surviving an abusive relationship.

Today she's wearing a black T-shirt with bold white letters on it that say, ""free.""

Legal immigration status has brought some stability, but she says it's impossible to feel secure when almost everyone you know is still at risk.

Valeria Rodriguez Cobos says she's trying to use her voice to help people who are too scared to speak out. ""Deportations are happening,"" she says. ""People here in Winston don't talk about that. They're afraid.""

Rodriguez Cobos chokes up as she tells the crowd how privileged she feels to have a green card.

""It's something I know my family still doesn't have,"" she says. ""So for me, the fight is not over until we're all safe.""

A woman who works with refugees describes the harrowing stories they've told her about what happened before they fled their homes. A Wake Forest law professor explains that there's nothing illegal about the resolution the City Council is finally about to vote on. Besse tells the crowd that whatever happens to his resolution tonight doesn't really matter.

The important thing, he says, is continuing community activism, standing up for what's right and not letting lawmakers in Raleigh dictate the way the city handles its affairs.

""We cannot afford to capitulate to bullying tactics and intimidation, telling us not to speak up and out on behalf of those who are marginalized in our communities.""

Pointing toward home

Lori Apple watches from a few feet away, wearing a sparkling American flag lapel pin on her jean jacket. The protesters' words quickly get under the 60-year-old physical therapist's skin.

They seem to be fanning the flames of emotions, she says, rather than relying on facts.

Apple, the head of a local Republican women's association, says the welcoming city resolution quickly drew fire from many people in her party.

It's clear, she says, that the measure is a thinly veiled attempt to turn Winston-Salem into a sanctuary city. That's extremely unwise, she says, given vows by Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to yank federal funding from local jurisdictions that don't cooperate with immigration enforcement efforts.

And it's not just federal officials who are threatening to fight back against local measures, she says.

State lawmakers in North Carolina outlawed sanctuary cities back in 2015. Then-Gov. Pat McCrory signed the measure in nearby Greensboro. And now, legislators in Raleigh are weighing ways to punish local governments that take sanctuary steps.

But Apple says the concerns she and others share aren't just about the millions of dollars Winston-Salem could stand to lose.

She says she's worried about her family -- about the spots they could lose in college, about extra time they could be stuck waiting in emergency rooms, about the ways crime could go up and terrorists could slip in.

""I have children and I am concerned with the safety of our community,"" she says. ""The loud voices of a few drown out the quiet voices of good, hard-working Americans who are not in favor of these kinds of measures.""

Lori Apple says the US should approach immigration the way she handles her home. ""It makes sense to have a wall,"" she says, ""because I have a door protecting my house.""

To sum up her views on immigration, Apple uses her three-bedroom house in Lewisville, about 15 minutes outside Winston-Salem, as a metaphor.

There are only so many items in the refrigerator to go around and only so many rooms in the house where there's space to live, she says. And of course, she keeps the doors locked at night and takes other steps, she says, to protect against intruders.

Resources are scarce in America, Apple says. And the country needs to do what it can to keep out terrorists and keep its citizens safe.

That's all the president and North Carolina's state lawmakers are trying to do, she says.

""There's a lot of anger among people towards Trump,"" she says. ""But he's trying to protect us.""

'I show them safety'

Across town, Carmen is just winding down her day cleaning houses.

The 43-year-old undocumented immigrant can't make it to tonight's meeting. But she's been following news of the proposed ""welcoming city"" measure closely. And she's hoping the city will pass it.

""It would be a safer city,"" she says. ""It would be a relief for us.""

Carmen, who asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her family's safety, has trouble feeling safe these days.

She's terrified that Trump will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting her three children in jeopardy.

She's afraid jobs for immigrant workers are going to dry up.

She's scared to go out at night.

She senses people are giving her hostile glances in stores.

Carmen, a 43-year-old undocumented immigrant, turns to her faith as times get tough. These days, she finds herself spending more time inside her Winston-Salem home. She's scared to be out late at night or go to parks with her family.

It wasn't like this before, Carmen says. Trump, she says, has planted seeds of hatred across the country. But Carmen says she's seen love blossoming, too. One day people from a nearby church left signs outside for her church's largely immigrant congregation.

""Somos uno en Cristo."" We are one in Christ.

""Dios te ama."" God loves you.

""Nos encantan nuestros vecinos."" We love our neighbors.

Carmen was overjoyed. She snapped photos of her children with the signs and keeps them on her phone.

She's afraid of what will happen next, but she doesn't talk about it with her children.

""I show another face to them. I show them safety,"" she says. ""I don't show them the fear I feel.""

A tense wait

Inside City Hall, Fleming is one of the first people to arrive in the City Council's meeting room.

It's already tense. There aren't enough chairs. Some people whisper. Others glare suspiciously across the room.

Fleming settles on a spot in the middle of the third row, then moves to the other side of the room after a man snarls at her for trying to save a seat.

Rodriguez Cobos sits with a few friends on the floor of a room upstairs, their eyes trained on a TV screen.

So many people have shown up to tonight's meeting that officials opened two overflow rooms to give them a chance to follow what's happening.

Rodriguez Cobos' friends are US citizens whose parents are undocumented immigrants, and they're here to make their voices heard. But as they sit inside the imposing government building, Valeria can see that her friends are spooked.

She tries to explain what she knows about city government to them. In between her business administration classes at Salem College and her work at a local credit union, she's been coming here regularly for months. The pomp and circumstance of a local government meeting is familiar now. The way the clerk reads out the name of each resolution. The way the council members make motions.

She wants her friends to feel like they belong here. This is their city, too, even though sometimes it may not feel like it.

As tonight's vote nears, they lean in toward the TV to listen.

Caught off guard

There's no fanfare as the clerk announces what's next on the agenda: ""Item G-4, Adoption of the 'Winston-Salem is a Welcoming City' Resolution."" This is the moment almost everyone in the building is waiting for.

But the mayor makes a surprise announcement that catches many of them off guard.

Besse, he says, has asked to withdraw the resolution from the night's agenda.

""He's working on an alternative thought,"" the mayor tells the crowd.

Rodriguez Cobos and her friends can't believe what they're hearing. She wants to run screaming into the meeting room. How can this be happening?

Fleming feels frustrated too. Her rush to get signatures for a petition, her push to save seats inside for fellow Republicans who feel the same way she does -- all of it seems like a waste of time.

A man rushes to the front of the room, yelling as he heads out the door: ""Boo! Cowards!""

In the public comment period that ends the meeting, speaker after speaker slams the City Council for letting worries about retribution from state and federal officials stop them from taking a stand.

""What we heard today,"" one woman says, ""was fear.""

One man says the move sets a dangerous precedent. ""If you allow them to bully you all, then who will they come for next?""

Another says he's tired of hearing people focus on crimes committed by immigrants.

""There's people who look like me who ran people over. There's people who shot up schools who look like me. Should we deport all of them, too? Are we just going to use fear as our guiding principle?""

Rodriguez Cobos is the last person to speak. She says she and others won't forget how the City Council backed down instead of standing up.

""Elections are coming up,"" she says, ""and people are paying attention.""

It's no coincidence that state lawmakers in Raleigh have tried to block the resolution, says Danny Timpona, who supports the measure. ""They're scared of us coming together,"" he says. ""They're scared we're paying attention.""

As Rodriguez Cobos walks to her car after the meeting, she looks over her shoulder.

She's determined to keep speaking out, but she knows it makes her a target.

Fleming walks quickly to her car, too.

She fears crime is on the rise. And you never know who might be watching.

The next battle

But Besse maintains his proposal isn't dead. Instead, he says he's planning to bring it back in a different form. Pulling it from the agenda was a change in tactics, he says, but not a retreat.

When he realized the welcoming city resolution wouldn't have enough support to pass, Besse says he withdrew the measure to avoid sending the wrong signal.

These days, he's carrying a copy of a new document inside his jacket pocket as he walks around Winston-Salem. He's hoping to convince leaders from across the community to sign on.

A joint statement from a broader group touting the city's welcoming nature, he says, will send a stronger message than any City Council resolution would.

Rodriguez Cobos and other organizers with the Sanctuary City Coalition of Winston-Salem say their fight has only just begun. They'll be marching in an upcoming ""day without immigrants"" protest.

And they're hoping to take more concrete steps to help protect an immigrant community under siege. One idea: emergency response teams that can report to areas where ICE arrests are taking place.

Fleming picked up a ""Make America Great Again"" sign on a recent trip. She's thrilled Trump won and glad he's made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority. ""If I weren't as old as I am,"" she says, ""I would go build that wall.""

Fleming says she's keeping a close eye on the City Council in case the welcoming city measure comes up again.

And she's going to keep canvasing for signatures on her petition opposing it.

She's also working on promoting the local Republican women's club's next activity: a self-defense class.

A family crisis

At a church Bible study meeting in northern Winston-Salem, Carmen is looking for answers.

The City Council meeting was a few days ago. She's still hoping officials will change their mind, and she wishes she'd been at City Hall to see what happened. She went once and loved the part where everyone stood together to say the Pledge of Allegiance.

But this week, she's barely had any time to spare. She's overwhelmed with a crisis that's shaken her family.

Her brother is in a detention center and could be days away from deportation.

His devastated 10-year-old daughter is barely talking or eating. All she does is cry. They're taking her to a psychologist, but Carmen doesn't know what else to do as she waits for word on whether officials will reopen her brother's case.

""I'm so worried,"" she tells the church group, tears streaming down her face.

Carmen says it's sad to hear Winston-Salem's ""welcoming city"" resolution hasn't passed. ""I don't know why they want to close the doors to us here,"" she says.

The pastor offers a prayer for Carmen and others at the table.

""God, we put our worries and our anguish in front of you. ... Touch the hearts of the authorities in this country,"" he says. ""Touch the hardened hearts that they seem to have right now.""

Carmen bows her head.

She prays for something she fears only God can give her now.

The other gun lobby,"They are, sadly, growing in number: Americans devastated by gun violence. The connections they've forged are strong. But can they defeat the NRA?

Their personal families are shrinking, while their ranks are growing: Families whose loved ones have been killed or wounded by guns.

They vow this time is different. They're no longer a loose patchwork of grass-roots groups that emerge after the latest mass shooting -- only to get outspent by the NRA's war chest, their hopes for ""common sense"" gun measures dashed.

The Loneliest Club They are survivors of gun violence. But they have more than that in common. They share a conviction: to use the worst days of their lives to make America a safer place. READ MORE

This time, they have the backing of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his $50 million donation. They are Everytown for Gun Safety, which in 2014 brought under one umbrella Bloomberg's two previous gun groups, Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.

Their focus is on field operations, to mobilize their 3 million members on this single issue and then get supporters to the polls. They steal tactics from the National Rifle Association and study other groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving that have won victories against massive industries.

They gather in cities around the country to learn how to target policymakers and stay unified. They plan rallies and organize on social media. They circle states where change is most possible. They work with the Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords' organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions, on federal legislation. They've found an ally in the White House.

They are the ""other"" gun lobby, unafraid of the NRA and its fervent backers.

Andy Parker took on the NRA after his daughter was killed on live TV.

The most powerful message lies within its survivors' network -- some 800 people who've had a loved one killed or wounded by a gun.

This determined crowd turns the conversation around on the most stridently pro-life conservatives: What are you doing to save the lives of America's children from gun violence?

They make lobbying one click away:

• Call your senators and demand a vote on universal background checks

• Send your condolences to those affected by the mass shooting in Oregon

• Join your local Moms Demand Action chapter

Everytown's efforts have already scored some victories. In Washington state, nearly 60% of voters supported mandatory background checks on private gun sales, closing a loophole that advocates say will keep guns from falling into the wrong hands. Oregon voters earlier this year passed a similar measure -- the sixth state to do so since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Everytown is next turning to background check ballot initiatives in Nevada and Maine.

Victories have taken shape in other forms, too.

Just this year, they defeated bills across 23 states that would have either let people carry guns in public schools or college campuses or would have let them carry concealed, loaded handguns in public with no permit and no training. They also defeated attempts to repeal universal background checks for all gun buyers in Colorado, and for all handgun buyers in Iowa and North Carolina.

Reporter Alison Parker and her cameraman were shot to death in August.

Eight states also passed laws to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.

The voices of these mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters have joined forces with the likes of Amy Schumer, Julianne Moore, Yoko Ono, Rosanne Cash and Don Cheadle. Those celebrities have formed an 80-person council to advocate for awareness of gun violence.

There seems to be a renewed urgency like never before -- that enough is enough.

For those within the survivors' group, their message is punctuated by that chilling, awful day when they got the news of a slain loved one. Reliving those memories has become a permanent part of their lives. A message, they say, America must hear.

This time, they won't be silenced. They don't want to ban guns. Many pack heat themselves. They just want to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, the seriously mentally ill and others who may pose a danger. If enacting universal background checks saves just one life, they ask, then isn't it worth it?

And so it is through these bonds of determination they unite. Friendships are formed.

""If we have to outspend the NRA, then that's what we'll do,"" Andy Parker says. ""We have dough behind us.""

Parker was thrust into the spotlight when his daughter, Alison, a TV reporter in Roanoke, Virginia, was killed along with her cameraman, Adam Ward, on live television in August. Ever since, her father has pushed for new measures to reduce gun violence.

Lori Haas has fought for tighter gun laws since the Virginia Tech massacre.

""I have the moral high ground here,"" he says.

But even he's been turned away by some of the nation's political leaders, politicians, he says, who take their ""cues from the NRA [rather] than trying to save lives.""

""They're pro-life, but after you're born all bets are off,"" Parker says. ""It doesn't make you feel really good.""

Parker has been aided in his fight by Lori Haas, who has advocated for changes to America's gun laws since her daughter, Emily, was shot and wounded in the Virginia Tech massacre that left 32 people dead.

Parker reached out to Haas shortly after his daughter was killed when he read a quote of hers about the power of the current movement. ""Our elected leaders will be booted out of office if they don't do something,"" she said.

The two now meet regularly. They stay at each other's homes. They've targeted Virginia lawmakers who they believe are vulnerable in November and are working to get their message out in those districts. They write op-eds. They speak on TV and radio. They share posts over Facebook and Twitter. Anything to spread the word.

""The connection is purposeful, but it's also very, very personal,"" says Haas.

Just this week, Parker and another survivor posed questions on Facebook for the Democratic candidates debating on CNN in Las Vegas.

""As president, will you commit to working towards requiring background checks for ALL gun sales?"" Parker asked. Erica Lafferty Smegielski, whose mother was killed at Sandy Hook, wanted to know what three things the candidates would do as president to keep other families from experiencing her pain.

Emily Haas was shot and wounded during the 2007 attack that killed 32.

""The NRA has a 30-year head start on us, but we're catching up now,"" says Parker. ""That's why I have reason for hope.""

Haas says there was little in the way of support after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. At times, she felt alone in her despair to take on the gun industry. Those days are over: ""We now have a platform.""

""Everything about the movement has just grown and grown and grown,"" she says.

Don't mistake their grief as a pity party. Their determination remains unwavering. Undying.

""We are pissed off and we want to do something about this,"" Parker says.

The war for them starts in their home state of Virginia. They've begun drawing up proposals to strengthen what they say are loose gun measures. They've earned the backing of Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

Winning in the state where the NRA is headquartered, they say, would be monumental.

""The fun is about to start,"" Parker says.

Erica Lafferty Smegielski and Jenna Yuille

Tale of two daughters

Erica Lafferty Smegielski, left, and Jenna Yuille lost their mothers to gun violence.

Their mothers were killed three days apart, in shootings that made national news. Not long after, they both began working to change gun laws.

But it was more than two years before they finally met, during an advocacy training program for survivors in New York.

Participants were gathered for an informal dinner, sitting in a circle and telling their stories. When it was Jenna Yuille's turn, she wept as she spoke.

As she did, Erica Lafferty Smegielski broke down -- ""those big ugly sobs,"" she says, which continued as she hugged Yuille later.

""I didn't know this at the time, but apparently [Erica] was known for being very strong, never crying and just amazingly always holding it together,"" says Yuille.

""I'd never met someone who'd been so impacted in such a similar way,"" says Smegielski. ""It hit too close to home for me.""

Their connection has only grown since then.

""There's a certain drive between us,"" says Yuille. ""We so want to change things for our moms.""

It was December 11, 2012, when Yuille lost her mother to gun violence.

A masked gunman armed with a stolen AR-15 semi-automatic rifle entered a Clackamas, Oregon, mall and fired off more than 60 rounds. Cindy Yuille, a hospice nurse who'd spent her life caring for others, was killed -- along with another man. The shooter then took his own life.

Sandy Hook principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung was killed in the 2012 rampage.

Three days later, on the opposite side of the country, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed six adults and 20 children. Among them was Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the school's principal and Smegielski's mother.

Just that morning, Smegielski had been texting with her mother about her upcoming wedding. They'd picked out the strapless white, long-tiered taffeta gown Smegielski would wear. Now she sent her mother a photo of custom teal-colored Converse sneakers with the words, ""Wedding shoes!""

""You're not going to really wear those, are you?"" her mother typed.

No stranger to her daughter's nontraditional ways, she must have already known the answer. She added a smiley face, one with a wink and a tongue sticking out.

""Yeah. Yeah I am,"" Smegielski, 30, remembers replying. ""I never heard back.""

Seven months later, as Smegielski prepared to walk down the aisle on her wedding day, she rushed off to the nearby cemetery with her grandmother, sister and cousin. She needed a picture with her mother.

Wearing a veil, the dress they'd selected together and those Converse sneakers, she bowed down to kiss her mother's headstone, a moment that was photographed and stays with her always.

""If the closest thing I could get was a piece of granite in the ground, that's what I was going to do,"" Smegielski says.

Yuille, too, treasures an image with her mother.

She holds tight to a photo from her college graduation, taken a year and a half before her mom's death. Around Yuille's neck, and atop her green University of Oregon gown, is a collection of cords, each one representing an honor she'd earned. Her mother stands beside her beaming.

""I miss her every day,"" says Yuille, 26, who works in communications for Nike in Portland. ""I think about how proud she'd be of everything I'm doing.""

Yuille's commitment to reducing gun violence kicked in early. A friend in politics began making connections for her. She testified at hearings. She wrote op-eds and did media interviews. She got involved in statewide elections and helped start Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership. And from the moment she was introduced to Everytown for Gun Safety, she was on board with the cause.

Cindy Yuille was murdered by a gunman who opened fire at an Oregon mall.

Smegielski couldn't return to the job she had before the Newtown shooting. Growing up with a mother who was a special ed teacher, then an administrator, schools had always been her safe place. So she gravitated to that world and worked as a college admissions counselor. After the massacre at Sandy Hook, that sense of safety was gone.

The more involved she got in gun violence issues, her comfort in other places disappeared, too. She won't go to movies and will only rent them. She avoids grocery shopping at all costs. That's what online delivery services are for, if her husband doesn't do it. She's not sure she can bring children into this world -- not just because her mom, who was her best friend, won't meet them but because the staggering statistics of gun violence terrify her.

""I have to make accommodations in my life because people are killed every day,"" Smegielski says. ""It's not a matter of if it will happen again, it's what town will it be? I have too much life left to take chances.""

For two years she's made this cause her profession. Smegielski, who lives in Prospect, Connecticut, is a senior outreach associate for Everytown for Gun Safety. She was in New York training survivor advocates when she and Yuille met.

The commonalities extend beyond losing their mothers to gun violence just days apart and being so close in age. Neither of them had close relationships to fathers or stepfathers. Their mothers were their parents, and their family support systems are small.

Though Yuille has a stepbrother 10 years younger, she was raised an only child. Smegielski has just one sibling, an older sister, who is married with kids. Besides her, her grandmother, her husband and his family, that's it for Smegielski.

They've discussed spending the holidays together. They also think about coming together around the anniversaries of their mothers' deaths so they can celebrate the women who raised them.

They can talk without judgment. They can discuss the merits of antidepressants or anti-anxiety pills without shame. They can lean on each other when new shootings make headlines and, as Yuille puts it, ""It feels like it's happening all over again.""

In spite of the miles that separate them, they vow to be there for each other as life goes on without their mothers.

Lucy McBath and Sharon Risher

The mother and the minister

Lucy McBath, left, reached out to the Rev. Sharon Risher after the Charleston shooting.

She weeps whenever she hears of another shooting, but the news out of Charleston, South Carolina, this summer brought Lucia ""Lucy"" McBath to her knees.

Learning that a gunman's rampage at a Bible study left nine dead made this woman of God crumble.

""I was devastated, as if it had happened to me,"" McBath says. ""I cried myself to sleep.""

The Rev. Sharon Risher was struggling, too. Details were trickling in, but the trauma chaplain was at work in a Dallas hospital, far from the city where she grew up. She had to pull it together to tend to a grieving family before she could focus on her own fears.

She hoped the early reports were wrong and that her momma, Ethel Lance, was OK. Her mother was a faithful member of the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

Calls to Lance's cell phone went unanswered, though, and she understood.

""I knew she was gone because there would have been no other place in the world she would have been,"" says Risher, who also lost two cousins, Susie Jackson and Tywanza Sanders, in the attack.

Risher at her seminary graduation with her mother, Ethel Lance, who was killed in Charleston.

In Atlanta, McBath picked up her pen and got to work. She's a faith and community outreach leader for Everytown for Gun Safety, and writing letters to survivors of gun violence -- including relatives of victims -- is a role she embraces.

She knows the importance because she's been on the other side. In 2012, McBath's only child, 17-year-old Jordan Davis, was shot and killed at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station during a dispute over loud music. She was flooded with cards, emails and Facebook messages -- and she's saved them all.

""That's part of Jordan's legacy,"" she says.

But no one who wrote had suffered as she had. For Risher, she could be that person.

""Nobody can understand what you're feeling and thinking other than someone who's really been through it,"" says McBath, 55. ""I, as a victim, understand completely.""

Risher's mother was the first victim buried after the Charleston shooting. Risher stayed in her hometown for the funeral of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a state senator and Emanuel's pastor. Thousands attended, and President Barack Obama gave the eulogy.

After that, she'd had all she could take of funerals. Back home in Dallas a few days later, she was greeted with a pile of letters and cards, forwarded to her by the Charleston church fondly known as Mother Emanuel. One envelope stuck out because Risher's name was written along the side. Inside she found what she didn't yet know she needed: a two-page handwritten letter with words of sympathy, the story of McBath's own heartache, an outstretched hand in support -- and a personal phone number.

Risher wasn't the only one in need. For McBath, the work she does for Everytown for Gun Safety -- and as a national spokeswoman for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America -- is a source of comfort for herself as well. She's helped promote two documentary films that feature her and her son's stories -- ""3½ minutes, 10 bullets"" and ""The Armor of Light."" She's testified at hearings, spoken at summits, lobbied legislators, created a foundation in her son's name and more.

""We're trying to sort of shove the pain away a bit and work through the pain,"" she says of survivors like herself. ""But then, when I slow down, it comes crashing down on me. ... Two weeks ago, I had a day when I was weeping all day because I missed my boy so much.""

Jordan Davis was killed in Jacksonville, Florida, in a dispute over loud music.

After reading McBath's letter, Risher didn't hesitate. She grabbed her phone and began to dial. That first conversation was more tears than talk.

""She was just pouring out her heart,"" says McBath. ""And I was crying because I hate the fact that she has to go through this.""

In one another, they say they've found a kindred spirit. They relate not just because they've endured similar sorts of shock and pain but because they are both African-American, God-fearing women.

And while race played a part in the shootings that robbed them of loved ones -- in Charleston the gunman wanted ""to start a race war,"" while in Jacksonville the shooter claimed self-defense and reportedly described Davis and his friends as ""thugs"" and ""gangsters"" -- they insist the problem is bigger than that. They want the conversations to be about gun safety, first and foremost.

Risher, 57, is just stepping into the role of activist. She's attended several Everytown for Gun Safety gatherings in Washington and has spoken to media. She thanks God for sending McBath her way. While her own children and others are there for her, McBath offers something no one else can.

""She's been a constant beacon,"" Risher says. ""She's just grabbed me into her bosom and said, 'I'll be here for you spiritually and emotionally, even if I can't be there for you physically.'""

Whether it's quick text messages, phone calls or face-to-face meetings, their connection endures. They've created a safe space for each other. Sometimes they talk about wanting to escape for a girls' weekend, a chance, as McBath puts it, to ""breathe the air outside the tragedy."" Risher imagines someplace warm, where they can ""sit on the beach and drink drinks with umbrellas in them.""

Someday they'll get there, but for now there's too much work to be done.

DeAndra Yates and Diana Alvarado Rodriguez

'From so much pain, there's triumph'

Diana Alvarado Rodriguez, left, was drawn to DeAndra Yates after reading about her son.

DeAndra Yates pounded on the hotel door next to hers. Diana Alvarado Rodriguez, the woman she considers a sister, answered. It was the middle of the night.

""Girl, what's going on?"" Rodriguez said.

""My son!"" Yates cried. ""He's sick and he's been rushed to the hospital.""

Yates had been awakened by a call that took her back to the moment she learned her boy had been shot at a birthday party.

That was more than 1½ years ago. The shooting left Dre a quadriplegic at 13.

Now, the voice on the other end of the line was telling her Dre had suffered two seizures, one lasting 20 minutes.

He needed to be taken from a hospital in Carbondale, Illinois, to a more specialized children's hospital in St. Louis.

His condition was critical.

Yates was hundreds of miles away in Denver, at a conference earlier this month with Rodriguez and other members of the Everytown for Gun Safety Survivor Network.

They had talked about the power of uniting, how to organize and spread their message. How to lean on each other when dark moments strike.

In Rodriguez's hotel room, Yates broke down. Consumed by self-doubt, she wondered: Why did I leave my son's side? How am I going to get back to him?

Dre Yates was shot at a birthday party; the bullet left him a quadriplegic.

Rodriguez immediately swung into action. She rounded up other members of what she calls Team Dre. ""We were able to put to practice what we were being taught,"" Rodriguez says.

Rodriguez knows pain. Her 18-year-old daughter, Samantha Guzman, was shot and killed as she walked home from a party with friends in the Bronx on Mother's Day 2006.

Soon, about six people were gathered in Rodriguez's hotel room. Rodriguez and another woman prayed, while others began booking flights. They weren't going to let Yates fly home by herself. Rodriguez would escort her to the hospital and stay until family arrived.

""I was scared to death. I didn't know what was going to happen to my son,"" Yates says. ""That's the power of the network and the power of the connection that she and I have on a personal level.""

""That was an honor,"" adds Rodriguez. ""It's about being compassionate, about being there for the person when they need you. That's what I wanted: I wanted to be there for her.""

The two women have been constant companions since meeting over Facebook about a year ago. Rodriguez was drawn to Yates after reading posts about caring for her son. A bullet had entered the back of Dre's head and left the former middle school football star using a wheelchair, unable to speak. Success these days is measured by incremental victories, like seeing him smile.

Rodriguez's daughter, Samantha Guzman, was killed walking home from a party.

""It was beautiful -- and it was somebody who had survived. Not too many of our children are surviving this mess that's going on,"" Rodriguez says. ""For me, that was something special because I have always thought: What would've happened if my daughter would have survived?""

When her daughter was killed in 2006, Rodriguez had to figure out how to grieve by herself. There were not many groups for people with loved ones killed by gun violence. Certainly, none reaching out to her at the height of her pain.

She knew the turmoil Yates was suffering. Ever since they connected, they've spoken by phone and texted daily. It's a shared camaraderie that only these families know, a pain so great it reaches into the depth of the soul.

""We share tears and we just talk, you know,"" Rodriguez says.

Yates felt that instant connection, too. When Rodriguez rests her hand on Yates' shoulder, you can see the love the two share. It radiates from their faces. When they speak, they finish each other's sentences. Yates wears a purple and black bracelet for Rodriguez's daughter Samantha. Rodriguez wears a beaded bracelet for Dre.

Just a week before Dre's recent hospitalization, the two shared monumental joy: Dre had walked on a treadmill for the first time since being shot. Now, he was struggling to live.

Yates couldn't have gone through the ordeal without her best friend and the others who support her.

""My son is still struggling with his disabilities, and everyone else has lost their children. People are like: 'Wow, her son is alive, but look at what she's having to go through.' It opens up other survivors' minds -- that this is an everyday battle.

""And for me, I look at them and say, 'I know it's hard for me, but it's even harder for them because they can't even touch or see their child.'""

Rodriguez and Yates vow nothing can break their bond. Don't tell them America's gun laws can't be changed. Because the fact is, Rodriguez says, ""Something's gotta be done. The violence needs to stop.""

But, Yates adds, ""We are learning that something greater is coming out of it. ... From so much pain, we have found triumph.""

Tom Sullivan and Jane Dougherty

'Superman' and the dressmaker

Tom Sullivan ""is our tough guy,"" says Jane Dougherty. ""I'm the heart.""

At home, Jane Dougherty is a mother, wife and bridal dress maker in Littleton, Colorado. But when she talks about the need for tighter gun laws, she speaks as a woman who lost her sister to gun violence.

Mary Sherlach, a school psychologist and Dougherty's older sister, was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut.

Dougherty is often joined in her activism by Tom Sullivan, who lost his son, Alex, in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater massacre five months earlier.

A retired postal worker, Sullivan says he represents the fathers and ""lunch bucket guys"" who try to do everything right and keep their families out of harm's way, only to find that gun violence is random.

Together, they make a formidable pair when they call on Colorado lawmakers to support universal background checks and gun restraining orders for domestic abusers and the mentally ill.

""He's our tough guy. He's the one calling legislators out,"" Dougherty says. ""I'm the heart. I can make legislators cry.""

And they have each other's back.

The two were at the Colorado State Capitol in 2014, waiting outside a committee room to testify, when a man wearing a brown robe emblazoned with gun patches approached Dougherty and started ranting.

""Your sister should've had a gun,"" she remembers him saying. ""If she had a gun she could have shot that guy.""

Alex Sullivan was killed in the Aurora massacre while celebrating his birthday.

Sullivan stepped in and yelled for guards to let Dougherty enter the room and escape the confrontation.

""He was there for me,"" she says. ""He'll always be my Superman.""

Dougherty and Sullivan met at a rally in Denver on the first anniversary of the Aurora shooting. Her sister's death 2,000 miles away inspired Dougherty to work for stricter gun laws in her home state, and Sullivan knew of her activism. They became fast friends, joining Facebook groups for gun violence survivors and getting to know each other's families.

News stories often refer to Sullivan's ""superhero-like"" insistence on creating positive outcomes from shootings. It's part of his ""Irish DNA,"" Sullivan jokes. ""We're kind of built for death and problems in our lives.""

Sullivan and his son bonded over superheroes during regular trips to All C's Collectibles, a comic book store just down the road from where James Holmes killed Alex and 11 others at a midnight screening of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Alex was there with friends to celebrate his 27th birthday.

In the wake of the shooting, Sullivan joined forces with Jason Farnsworth, owner of All C's, to launch Aurora Rise -- a Batman-themed charity that provides financial and moral support to Aurora survivors.

Sullivan also uses his postal service past to reach out to labor unions, a group he says is ""not our friend on gun violence prevention issues.""

The son of Air Force parents, his family moved around before settling in Rochester, New York. He grew up playing sports instead of hunting and fishing. After he joined the Air Force, he picked up a firearm just once -- during basic training.

He married his childhood sweetheart, Terry, and they moved to Colorado in 1980. He got a union job delivering express mail so he could someday retire with a pension. He worked hard to provide for his wife and ""Irish twins,"" Alex and daughter Megan, born 15 months later.

He raised Alex to play by the same rules. Alex wasn't in the wrong place at the wrong time when he was killed, his father says. ""He was right where he was supposed to be, at the movies, celebrating his birthday with his friends.""

Sullivan thought he had done his part to protect his family, and he assumed the gun industry was doing theirs to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.

Then he sat through the trial of his son's killer and was alarmed to learn how easy it was for Holmes to assemble his artillery unnoticed: He had 4,000 rounds drop-shipped to the FedEx near the coffee shop where Megan worked; he periodically showed up at a shooting range with a trunk full of ammo for practice; he spent $11,000 in three months on firearms, tear gas, ammo and body armor.

Dougherty's sister and school psychologist Mary Sherlach was killed at Sandy Hook.

Nobody connected the dots.

""We have a whole section of the government that's supposed to be watching for terrorists coming, and it's pretty clear a terrorist could be sitting right here and order all the ammo he wants,"" Sullivan said.

""You come to learn that it's run by an industry whose only interest is to make money, sell more guns and keep the public scared.""

Before the shooting, Sullivan was a sports fan, another passion he shared with his son. After July 20, 2012, ""that stopped."" Now he's a news junkie, and fighting to change gun laws has become his life.

It's much the same for Dougherty. Like Sullivan, guns were not a part of her life growing up in Binghamton, New York, the fourth of five children. Now, she admits it's an obsession, a promise she made to her sister on the day of her funeral.

A graduate of New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, Dougherty built a successful business designing wedding dresses -- first by word of mouth in Westchester County, then again in Colorado. It's the other half of what she wryly calls her ""sad reality show"" life: ""guns and brides.""

The first time she thought about gun violence was December 8, 1980, when John Lennon was gunned down outside his Central Park West home. She was living in Manhattan at the time, and it felt close to home.

After she moved to Littleton with her first two children in 1992, gun violence continued to swirl around her, getting closer and closer.

First came Columbine, in 1999. She remembers filling up her car at a gas station on the road to Columbine High School when police cars zipped past, sirens screaming. Her children's two schools were locked down.

Then, in 2010, a gunman opened fire outside Deer Creek Middle School, where her youngest daughter, born in Colorado, once attended. Two students were injured before her daughter's former math teacher tackled the gunman.

Dougherty was in her workshop, sewing dresses for clients, when she learned about the shooting at Deer Creek. She was putting the final touches on her daughter's wedding dress in her workshop when she learned about Aurora on TV.

It's also where she was when she got the phone call from her husband saying there'd been a shooting in Connecticut.

She knew that gun violence had finally caught up with her family.

The last time she'd seen Mary alive was that August, at the wedding of Dougherty's daughter. Married for 31 years with two children of her own, Mary had flown in from Connecticut. Though the sisters spoke often by phone, it was a rare reunion, so Dougherty sat Mary at the family table.

""I was selfish and I wanted her at my table because I never get to see her,"" Dougherty says. ""I'll always remember her walking in my house and giving her a hug in my foyer.""

Dougherty has found solace and solidarity with the survivor community. They're like family, which is why she jumped at the chance to help Sullivan's daughter prepare for her own wedding. It would fall during the trial of Alex's killer. Perhaps she could make it easier on them.

After seeing Megan write on Facebook about problems find a wedding dress, Dougherty reached out, reminded her she worked in bridal and invited her to the shop.

Jane Dougherty with her sister on Mary's wedding day in 1981.

Megan came in with her mother, Terry, and chose an A-line strapless dress. Dougherty customized it with a netted neckline and added pearl buttons from Terry's wedding dress up the back.

While working on Megan's dress, she couldn't help but think of the first bridal gown she made. It had been in 1981, when she was still in New York. It was for her sister Mary.

""I was just so happy that Megan was smiling,"" Dougherty says. The dress was her gift -- from one surviving sister to another.

Amazon natives hold on to tradition,"Qumperi' is the shaman of the community, Pandya said, and he plays a very important role in the Huaorani culture. He is the healer of the community who has a trusted and vast knowledge of animals, plants and trees, including those which are used as poisons or medicines.

This is Awa, the founder of Bameno, the largest Huaorani community in the Amazon.

Macaws and parrots are a common sight in the Huaorani home, Pandya said. The Huaorani, which means ""the people,"" or ""human beings,"" are believed to have inhabited the Amazon rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.

It was really fascinating to see how the Huaorani coexisted with animals, Pandya said. Even as hunters, they seemed to have very strict rules of what was deemed ethically acceptable and what was inhumane. Sometimes when they are out hunting, they kill a parent animal and bring its orphan child back to the community. They then nurture the baby until it is an adult.

For his formal portraits, Pandya placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the Huaorani in a very direct and concise manner, eliminating the presence of any distractions. It also highlights the coexistence between the Huaorani and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment.

Story highlights Photographer Trupal Pandya took portraits of the Huaorani people in Ecuador's rainforest The community is beginning to modernize, but it still maintains its traditional ways of living

(CNN) —

Deep within the Amazonian rainforest of Ecuador live the Huaorani.

Photographer Trupal Pandya traveled about 30 hours by air, water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits.

The Huaorani, which means “the people” or “human beings,” are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.

Pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living.

Diverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing. For Pandya, these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the Huaorani.

“The biggest (reason) was to just go out there and photograph the change before everything changes,” Pandya said. “I think if I would have (photographed the Huaorani) 10 years back down the line or a little later than that, I don’t think I would have got what I just got.”

Another aspect of modernization has to do with language. Many Huaorani, who for years have only communicated using a regional dialect, now speak the Ecuadorian native language of Spanish.

Pandya speaks English, so he needed translators to interact effectively. But it is apparent from his experiences with the Huaorani that actions can certainly not only speak louder than words, but be more effectual than words when attempting to convey one’s intentions.

“I never started photographing when I (first) saw (the Huaorani),” he said. “I didn’t even have my camera. I waited to let them get used to me around them. I gave myself time to get a little easier around them. Even if you cannot talk in the same language, I feel that you definitely connect to them as a human being.”

Prior to creating formal portraits using his professional camera equipment and lighting, Pandya took Polaroid photos of the Huaorani that they were then able to keep.

“I think some of them saw the Polaroid for the first time, so they were really happy to see themselves like that,” Pandya said.

For his formal portraits, Pandya placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the Huaorani in a very direct and concise manner, eliminating the presence of any distractions.

“The main reason was to have the focus only on the people and their clothes and nothing else but them as an individual, them as a human being,” he said.

Pandya’s decision to use a white background also proved effective in highlighting the coexistence between the Huaorani and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment.

Creating portraits of the Huaorani has been a “fascinating, challenging” experience for Pandya, who is studying photography in New York at the Fashion Institute of Technology.

After witnessing firsthand the simplicity in which the Huaorani live in harmony with their environment, Pandya said he finds himself thinking about and reflecting upon what it truly means to be satisfied and content with life.

“I think the question I ask myself is: ‘Who’s richer?’ ” he said. “(This has been) a really big learning curve of how to just live a very beautiful, normal life.”

Show animals and their proud handlers,"Daniel with his white Muscovy duck that won Best Waterfowl at a show in Somerset.

Traditional Welsh pigs are judged at a show in Builth Wells, Wales. That's a sausage advertisement behind them.

Harriet, 13, exhibits a guinea pig, Gentleman Jack, that matches her red hair. ""I just thought that was incredibly striking,"" said Woodward, who won an award for the portrait.

Jamie, 15, prepares to exhibit his Jersey cow at a livestock show in Somerset, England. Photographer Jooney Woodward thought his cheerfulness showed that ""sense of enjoyment"" handlers have when competing with their animals.

Story highlights Jooney Woodward took portraits of show animals and their handlers in the UK The livestock shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings

(CNN) —

Every year, animal handlers travel throughout England and Wales to compete at agricultural shows.

Jooney Woodward’s “Best in Show” is a documentation of those competitions, with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals.

“When you go to (the shows), they tend to be all about the animals – people photographing the animals,” Woodward said. “I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they’re so committed to what they do. They’re really devoted and hardworking.”

While those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward’s work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style.

“My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way,” she said. “I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, ‘I’d love a portrait of you and your cow,’ everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they’re so passionate about what they do.”

Jooney Woordward Photographer Jooney Woodward

The “Best in Show” portraits lead viewers down a winding pathway to ponder those inexplicable yet noticeable connections and bonds that exist between the handlers and their animals.

Woodward’s photos also contain subtle details. For example, the symbols and signs on the wall behind Wendy and her Hereford yearling heifer Mandalay Juliette are just as significant as the handler and her animal.

“It’s just the way (Wendy) had gone through the effort of decorating the pen (with Union Jacks) where the cows were being kept,” Woodward said. “There’s also a sign behind (her) … and there’s a picture of a gentleman with a cow, who is actually her husband who had died a few years ago. … I just thought that was nice, something quite sentimental about that.”

There are not only sentimental subtleties within “Best in Show,” but also fun and interesting ones as well. This is especially evident in the photo of the traditional Welsh pigs being judged, as Woodward points out there is an advertisement for sausages behind the pigs.

Regardless of what elements make up Woodward’s photos, the emotions and aesthetics remain particularly important.

I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they’re so committed to what they do. They’re really devoted and hardworking. Photographer Jooney Woodward

Woodward said that when photographing Jamie and his Jersey cow, his happiness and smile made her want to “share that sense of enjoyment” that handlers have when competing with their animals in the shows.

What drew Woodward to Harriet and her guinea pig Gentleman Jack were the similar colors radiating from both of them. Her photo of the pair won the National Portrait Gallery’s Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize in 2011.

“(Harriet) was like a steward, she was sort of judging the guinea pigs. And she also had her own guinea pig with her, which had red as well,” Woodward said. “I just thought that was incredibly striking. I thought, ‘I’ve got to get a shot of that.’ “

The dynamics of the competitions foster a community atmosphere in which everybody becomes acquainted with one another after having traveled to different shows for so many years. Woodward said this was an enjoyable aspect of her work because “you get to see lots of familiar faces.”

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

She has learned about the pride the handlers have toward their animals, and many of her presumptions about the competitions have now changed after having worked on “Best in Show.”

“I think when I first started going, I was sort of thinking the shows would be more novelty, fun things for these people,” she said. “But, actually, it isn’t really; it’s quite a serious thing, because they can make money from breeding.”

In addition to handlers earning significant money from breeding, they are also able to achieve recognition for their livestock. Those competing have a lot at stake when they make the decision to travel and compete, because the shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings.

The competitions are also rather family-oriented, and Woodward said that while adults compete, their sons, daughters and grandchildren are involved as well. The younger generations are likely to one day take over the responsibility of running the family farms, and everyone that participates seems to have a strong sense of pride and passion for agriculture.

“I think it’s something I will always document for the rest of my life, and see how things change,” Woodward said. “It was challenging, insightful and fun.”

Nineteen years under the rainbow,"It's all smiles for these two at the Hungary World Rainbow Gathering in 2014.

Light rays power through colossal trees, illuminating tents and tepees. According to Krivic, the exact locations of some of the Rainbow Gatherings are revealed through hand-drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past.

Members of a ""Rainbow Family"" sit together at a gathering in France in 2003. ""It's like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year,"" says Krivic.

According to Krivic, when a horn blows three times through the valley people start assembling into a giant food circle. Before the meal begins they hold hands, sing a rainbow tune and chant ""ohm.""

Many workshops and activities are available at the gatherings, where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques.

A man splashes in the water at a 1998 gathering in Pakistan. Krivic says that Rainbow Gatherings also tend to take place in regions of the world that ""need to be healed"" after having experienced devastating conflicts.

Two people embrace at a Rainbow Gathering in Hungary in 2014. Photographer Matjaz Krivic captured moments at gatherings over a span of 19 years at Rainbow Gatherings in various countries.

Story highlights Photographer Matjaz Krivic's ""Somewhere Under the Rainbow"" series was shot over 19 years Rainbow Gatherings celebrate the ideals of peace, harmony, freedom and respect

(CNN) —

Seeing a rainbow often fills people with a sense of joy, regardless of whether it is their first or 19th time witnessing the colorful creation.

Rainbow Gatherings – annual events that take place throughout the world – encompass a vibrant mixture of the environment and people to produce a similar feeling of excitement.

Photographer Matjaz Krivic’s “Somewhere Under the Rainbow” series was shot over 19 years at Rainbow Gatherings in various countries. According to Krivic, the meaning behind the name of the events originates from an ancient Hopi Native American prophecy about “Rainbow Warriors.”

Rainbow Gatherings involve a temporary community of people who meet to share their similar ideals – peace, harmony, freedom and respect. Those participating in the gatherings collectively refer to themselves as a “Rainbow Family.”

The community, which welcomes a wide spectrum of ages, comes together to embrace nature and establish an alternative space away from society’s popular culture of consumerism, materialism and mass media.

Those who attend are not required to pay any form of money, not even for food, and the gatherings do not have rigid structures of dominance nor one specific leader. Instead, Rainbow Gatherings are essentially idealistic movements driven by the convergence of its community’s beliefs in a more equitable society and its people’s love and tolerance for one another.

“The magic hat goes around and you put money if you have or if you want,” Krivic said. “(But) nobody needs to pay for the food. Everybody is welcome to go and eat there.”

Krivic says that Rainbow Gatherings also tend to take place in regions of the world that “need to be healed” after having experienced devastating conflicts. Past gatherings include those held in Serbia, Bosnia and Ukraine.

“I really don’t like what’s going on in this world. … There’s just so much stuff happening,” Krivic said. “You can always go to (Rainbow Gatherings) and stay there and have a nice time, and you don’t even have to pay for it. It will be a nice time, nice energy, not aggressive.”

One of the most enjoyable aspects about Rainbow Gatherings is the many workshops and activities that are available, where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques.

Another significant part of Rainbow Gatherings is the all-encompassing sound.

“I like the music, I’m an audiophile. I like all sorts of music, but when I go there it’s live, it’s there,” Krivic said. “It’s like two guys playing and eventually it’s like 50 people playing and the music is just so beautiful.”

The first Rainbow Gathering took place in Colorado in 1972, and it is believed to have been organized by youth counterculture “tribes” from Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Since then, the gatherings have extended to other areas in the United States as well as a number of different countries.

The international gatherings generally take place during the summer, before August’s full moon. According to Krivic, the exact locations of some of the Rainbow Gatherings are revealed through hand-drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

Krivic has had a diverse range of experiences at Rainbow Gatherings, and maintaining a consistent photographic process over the years has enabled him to witness firsthand the growth of his photography. Ever since his first Rainbow Gathering, Krivic has been using the same two film cameras and lenses.

“The gatherings didn’t change,” Krivic said, “but my photography did change – a lot. … I consider photography differently now.”

Krivic says a key consideration when taking photos was the use of film cameras as opposed to digital, which he believes do not fit in with the atmosphere of the gatherings. He also had to carefully decide who to photograph.

“I had some friends and I could take photos of them, and then eventually when I was going on and on, it just became like a family,” he said. “It’s like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year.”

Just as every person sees a rainbow in their own unique way, “Somewhere Under the Rainbow” enables viewers to let their vision roam freely around every corner of the photos, leaving them to cultivate their own perspectives and ripen their imaginations.

In one photo, Krivic takes viewers to Pakistan in 1998, where a man mesmerizes viewers as he stands in pristine blue water holding a mango in his hands.

It’s then 2003 in France. Light rays power through colossal trees, illuminating tents and tepees and dosing the atmosphere with warmth.

Viewers later discover a delicate morning hug between a man and woman at last year’s Rainbow Gathering in Hungary, with a sunflower softly blooming out of a ukulele.

As for Krivic, he feels that “Somewhere Under the Rainbow” is not finished and will never be.

“I will never complete it. I will always go because I like it,” he said. “I will take photos again of friends, and just go on with it.”

The Kurdish women fighting ISIS,"Peshmerga women travel through their base in the back of a pickup truck. The bond between the women is clearly strong, and gestures of affection are frequent.

Women in the Peshmerga, the national military force for the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq, undergo drill instruction on their base in Sulaymaniyah.

Story highlights Jacob Russell's intimate photo essay follows Kurdish female fighters He says the images of these Peshmerga have an important social, political role

(CNN) —

The image of the braided Kurdish female fighter, donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group ISIS, may have done more to promote the Kurdish cause in the West than anything else in recent years.

The Iraqi Kurds have long been pro-Western in orientation, but Western powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support, in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence. Now, with soccer moms in Middle America tweeting photos of Kurdish female fighters, Western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid Kurdish policies to their constituencies.

Jacob Russell’s sensitive photo essay brings much-needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of Kurdish female fighters.

Cyrus Moussavi Photographer Jacob Russell

Since last summer, international media – and Kurdish politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images – often objectified these women. Images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour (“girls with guns,” as Russell calls this type of portrayal) tend to portray more of the photographer’s assumptions about the woman’s emancipation than her actual experiences as a Kurdish woman in combat.

Russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters.

“I was wary of making images that fed into this idea of the heroic strong women fighters,” he said. “I think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by Kurdish leaders (who) know very well how attractive this image is to the Western media.”

Having lived in Kurdistan for nearly two years, Russell understands that many women join the Peshmerga or other Kurdish forces for unglamorous reasons. Many of the women he photographed turned to the Peshmerga to escape abusive marriages or other forms of repression women continue to face there.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

“A lot of the women’s backstories were quite difficult,” he said. “It seemed like this unit provided an alternative network for women who maybe would struggle in normal Kurdish society, because despite being relatively progressive (within the Middle East), it is still quite a conservative society.”

Russell explores the theme of sisterhood, and in one image he captures the women in an intimate moment in the back of a pickup truck, their fingers intertwined. That photo, he says, is his favorite from the shoot.

“I think that image is one of the more expressive ones that (shows) what really seems to be going on there,” he said. “I didn’t want to take pictures that conveyed the idea that this was all about hardcore fighters going into battle and killing lots of (ISIS) fighters. That just didn’t seem to be the case.”

Russell remarks that the image of the female fighter carries an important social role, conveying to the world the (relatively) progressive values that Kurds pride themselves on.

The women now serve a political role, too. As Western governments eye more military engagement with Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria, these women may boost the Kurds’ international standing.

Girls behind bars tell their stories,"Meals from juvenile facilities around the country. Some facilities spend less than $2 a day per youth, Ross said.

""For a long time, I took pride in not prostituting. My last relapse, I started prostituting on my own,"" said B.X., 18. ""My mom and dad were both alcoholics. They owned a bar. I was left alone a lot. My mom was drunk when she found me on the street. I had run away. She attacked me and wouldn't let go. I punched her in the face. It wasn't that hard.""

""I was at the packing plant for about 16 months,"" said R.T., 16. ""(Immigration and Customs Enforcement) had a big raid, lots of trucks and men with guns and helicopters. They deported most of the people but kept some of us to go to court against the owners. They had a lot of minors working. All of us were from the same little village in Guatemala. We live in houses that the company owns. I think they let me stay because of my baby.""

B.E., 17, shows marks on her arms. She told Ross that she and her sister were sexually assaulted by her father. ""I haven't cut in years,"" she said.

""I read the Bible a lot,"" said T.Q., 16. ""My favorite passage is Jeremiah 15:15: 'Lord, you understand how much I am suffering. Show concern for me. Take care of me. Pay back those who are trying to harm me. You're patient. Don't take my life away from me.' ""

Many of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them. ""They took my brother and I away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down,"" said J.S., 16. ""I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do.""

""My dad died six years ago,"" said C.M., who is 16. ""They shot him 18 times. He was in the Mexican mafia. He died when I was 10. I've been messing up since then. Heroin. Meth. E. Inhalants. Crack. I was doing a lot of drugs when I was first pregnant, but now I've been sober for four months.""

K.N., a 15-year-old from Long Beach, California, was charged with battery and assault. ""The first time I went to placement, I was 11 for battery of a kid at school. I was in sixth grade,"" she told Ross. ""The police came to school and arrested me."" She said her release date is in four months. ""God thinks I can do better with my life, and He knows I will do better.""

A 16-year-old girl, identified only by the initials E.B., sits inside a juvenile detention center. ""I've been here 17 times,"" she says in Richard Ross' latest collection of images, ""Girls in Justice."" In addition to showing the ugliness of life behind bars, Ross gives each girl a chance to talk about themselves and how they got where they are.

Story highlights Photographer Richard Ross shows what life is like for girls in a juvenile detention center He wants to ""wake people up"" about the system and bring about ""immediate change""

(CNN) —

When photographer Richard Ross wants to talk to a child at a juvenile detention center, he knocks on their cell door. He asks them if he can come inside.

The 67-year-old Californian is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes, so he does the same in a cell.

“Most of the kids, they’ve never had that kind of respect,” he said. “But I give it to them, I give them the power. I sit on the floor so they’re looking down on me.”

Ross doesn’t begin by hammering them with questions. He wants to have a conversation.

“I say, ‘What’s gone on in your life?’ “

The result of that tenderness and patience is Ross’ latest collection of photos, “Girls in Justice.”

The images are unflinching. They convey the ugliness of a young person’s life behind bars. The pictures are replete with the unique loneliness, anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center. But the girls also tell their stories alongside the images.

Richard Ross Photographer Richard Ross

One photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit, hand on her head, sitting alone in a drab, cavernous room.

“I’ve been here 17 times,” one girl says.

Many of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them.

“Mom’s a stripper. Dad was an alcoholic, drug addict, murdered last year,” said one girl explaining her past. “They took my brother and I away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down. I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do.”

The photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks, staring at the wall. Some struggle with mental illness. The girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera. That works to protect their identities, but it also evokes shame. Ross seems to be saying the shame isn’t the girls’ – it’s ours as a society for jailing children.

His images aren’t always literal. A photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire. A straight-forward photo, of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors, turns the stomach after reading the caption – the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself.

Ross recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him, “I can’t wait to get out of here so I can kill myself.”

“She was just a kid, but she was at that place where you have no hope,” he said. “I feel all these stories, but that one just hit me hard. I was sobbing. You want to say, ‘It will get better,’ but you also know the system and you know that you can’t say that.”

Ross, the son of a New York City police officer, had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means. He got into a decent amount of trouble growing up, and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system.

But times were different then, he said, and there’s been a cultural turn in America toward criminalizing a child’s bad behavior.

He recalls a detention-center director in Reno, Nevada, who asked him to visit and take photos. At intake, he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class.

“This fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle,” Ross recalled. “He was drinking warm milk, like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk. I can still smell that milk. That intake area smelled like elementary school.”

You want to say, ‘It will get better,’ but you also know the system and you know that you can’t say that. Richard Ross

The child’s single mother couldn’t pick him up for hours. She was holding down a job that wouldn’t allow her to leave until after 6 p.m.

The detention-center director sent Ross’ photo to every principal in the area to make a point: Children do not belong in lockup, so find another solution.

Ross is adamant that he’s making photographs to bring about “immediate change.”

He speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates. His work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing.

“I’m trying to wake people up, make them realize there are lives at stake,” he said. “At the same time, I don’t, I can’t, position myself as the great hope. I might not be able to do much but listen. But I think I’m a good listener, and I think these kids deserve to tell their stories.”

Up close in the brutal world of a female fight club,"Red Devil tries on a new outfit. In the background, a fighter named Isi prepares herself for a fight.

Two women fight at a female fight club in Berlin. Photographer Katarzyna Mazur spent months at the club over the last two years.

Story highlights Katarzyna Mazur spent months photographing a female fight club in Berlin ""I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,"" Mazur said

(CNN) —

Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength.

There are no official rules to this female fight club. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014.

Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or “cat fight.” There’s no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they’ve decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it’s a place for women to shed the roles they play outside.

“When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,” said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. “Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.”

Katarzyna Mazur Photographer Katarzyna Mazur

At first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn’t satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action.

“It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,” she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. “I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet.”

For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn’t always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning “How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?”

“I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,” she said.

She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too – they’re mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives.

Even years later, the fight club is still running and is “better than ever,” Mazur said.

“Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,” Mazur said. “It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind).”

Crawling in a ‘polio-free’ country,"Someone gives money to Kumar in November. ""Indian people only give one or two rupees,"" he told del Estal. ""I prefer foreign people; they give 10 rupees or more.""

Dharmender lies on a bed in St. Stephen's Hospital a few days before his surgery. Even though his village was poor, his family took good care of him, del Estal said.

A child is vaccinated at a train station in Kolkata, India, in January 2014. Transit stations have been key points for the Pulse Polio immunization program.

Dharmender has been affected by polio since he was 6 months old. In February 2014, he had surgery on his right knee and hip.

Emtiach lies on a street in New Delhi, begging for money in November. His left leg is thin and powerless because of polio. He came to the city from Bihar, one of the states that used to be most affected by polio. His wife is also affected by the disease.

An empty bed in the polio ward of St. Stephen's Hospital in New Delhi. The ward used to be filled with patients, but it was announced last year that the disease had been eradicated in the country.

Bipin Kumar was infected by polio when he was 5 years old. For the last 10 years, he has earned money by begging in a New Delhi bazaar. Photographer Elena del Estal befriended him last year. ""I want to go to his village to meet his mother and keep taking pictures about his life because he is such a beautiful person,"" she said.

Story highlights In March of last year, it was announced that polio had been eradicated in India Photographer Elena del Estal couldn't help but wonder about those already living with the disease

(CNN) —

Imagine sitting on a dusty, busy street in New Delhi, crowded with vendors and people running quickly about the market. A woman’s lapis-colored sari swishes past you in the golden-colored dusk. You’ve been here since morning.

A tourist extends a hand with a crumpled paper bill. You try to lift your hand to accept, but you can’t. The muscles are paralyzed, and your mind can’t command them to move. You use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee. Then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day.

This is everyday life for Bipin Kumar. Kumar, known as BK, contracted polio as a child, and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives. Kumar has no brothers or father to provide for him, so he moved to New Delhi 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could – begging on the streets.

Photographer Elena del Estal was in India last year when the World Health Organization announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country. It had been exactly three years since the last contracted case. Del Estal was fascinated by this. She couldn’t help but wonder about those already living with the crippling effects of this horrible disease.

She traveled to a small village near Kolkata to meet a little girl who was India’s last case of polio. This gave her the inspiration to begin a long-term project on those suffering in a country that’s now “polio-free.”

First she met a boy named Dharmender who lived in Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India. Even though his village was poor, his family took good care of him. Del Estal spent time with him and accompanied him during a surgical procedure in New Delhi. She said that while Dharmender is very fortunate to have the opportunity for surgery, he will still never have a “normal” life.

“His daily life is hard. … Everybody around him was working and having a family, and he cannot have this,” Del Estal said. “So on one hand, it’s (a) hard situation, and on the other hand, it’s easier than the other boy I met.”

She’s speaking of Kumar, the young man who moved to New Delhi to support himself and his elderly mother back home in a village up north. Del Estal first met Kumar when she was wrapping up the first segment of her project. From the beginning, she said, he was very trusting, allowing her into his daily life.

Del Estal was intent on capturing an authentic portrayal of Kumar’s life – the everyday logistics of moving through a city without one’s limbs at command. She said she was amazed at how adept he was at maneuvering his world. He could carry notebooks with his neck, grasp a pencil in between his clutched fingers, smoke a cigarette using his feet and prop his arms on his knees to move them forward.

Between the two of them – Del Estal speaking a little Hindi and Kumar speaking a little English – they wove a patchwork language of friendship and understanding. Kumar told her of his love interest – a girl who had feelings for him as well – but her parents would never allow their union.

Del Estal said that while Kumar wants a job, employment is next to impossible for someone in his condition. But his spirit is tenacious. He knows how to read and write and he is skilled at taking care of himself. Before heading to the main bazaar in New Delhi every day, he washes and dresses himself. There are no days off for him. As shops open and tourists fumble through a foreign world in flip-flops and Bermuda shorts, Kumar positions himself in a visible location and smiles and greets everyone who passes with, “Namaste.”

Del Estal has been so impacted by his friendship that she said her next plans are to do a project on his life.

“I want to go to his village to meet his mother and keep taking pictures about his life because he is such a beautiful person,” she said. “It’s such a sad (circumstance) yet amazing life. I want to keep documenting his (story).”

Giving a face to Sudan’s refugee crisis,"Hawa Atif, 5, had a blood test taken and is waiting for the results.

Amira Osman, 13, came to the medical clinic with her younger sister, who sought care for a fever that turned out to be malaria.

Sadia Mahmoud, 35, and her child had been sick with fever for several days.

Mohammed Ali, 48, is working in the public relations department for the medical clinic, which was recently built by an Italian humanitarian group called Emergency.

Hawa Haranan, 40, works as a cleaner at a medical clinic. She was born in the war-torn Darfur region, and she came to the Mayo camp as a refugee.

A 10-month-old girl named Buseiwa was one of the many refugees that Pieter ten Hoopen took portraits of in Sudan's capital of Khartoum. Just before she entered the studio, she had taken a blood test for malaria.

Story highlights Pieter ten Hoopen took portraits of refugees at the Mayo camp in Khartoum, Sudan He set up a makeshift studio near a hospital, and it quickly became a sensation

(CNN) —

As a well-traveled photographer, Pieter ten Hoopen is no stranger to refugee camps.

But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.

Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.

His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn’t photograph outside the hospital compound.

“I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. … They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,” ten Hoopen said.

With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.

Pieter ten Hoopen Photographer Pieter ten Hoopen

The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.

One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.

“This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,” ten Hoopen said.

The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.

The photos span several generations – some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered – a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.

Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.

“They got very serious, they sat down upright. … I tried to say as little as possible,” he said. “I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative … and their unique perspective.”

The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.

“I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe … just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,” ten Hoopen said.

He said some patients at the hospital “had being laying there for months in their room. … Then you take them out, it’s a little treat to get them out of their own misery. … That’s why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio.”

Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.

I build classic photo studios … just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten Hoopen

Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.

Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.

“I really can appreciate old portraiture … when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,” he said. “It’s a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you.”

How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?

“It wasn’t hard,” he said. “I just told them to relax and have fun.

“Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don’t blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. … I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. … I have tattoos everywhere. … They thought I was a quite interesting creature.”

Story highlights AbilityOne is under investigation after allegations of fraud Federal investigators are specifically looking at accusations of bid rigging, favoritism Officials at AbilityOne, SourceAmerica deny allegations of wrongdoing

(CNN) —

A federal grand jury is examining the nation’s premier program that provides work for people who are severely disabled, after a series of CNN investigative reports detailing allegations of corruption and cronyism in what sources say could be the biggest fraud case ever in a U.S. government agency.

CNN has learned government investigators have issued grand jury subpoenas as they investigate the huge taxpayer-funded program, known as AbilityOne, and specifically its managing agency, SourceAmerica.

Along with bid rigging and corruption, grand jury investigators are looking into allegations the program is operating numerous contracts illegally, and not hiring enough disabled people to fill contracts as required by law, as CNN detailed in earlier reports.

The AbilityOne and SourceAmerica program dole out hundreds of multimillion-dollar contracts to scores of organizations. To get a contract, 75% of a company’s work must be performed by the severely disabled, people who cannot get work elsewhere.

Yet, numerous sources have told CNN that SourceAmerica awards contracts unfairly, giving lucrative deals to companies with inside connections. Some SourceAmerica board members have also worked at companies that are awarded big contracts.

One such example is outlined in a lawsuit alleging bid-rigging, one of several suits filed against AbilityOne and SourceAmerica in recent years.

The suit was filed by Ruben Lopez, owner of Bona Fide Conglomerates, a company that lost a contract bid to clean the federal courthouse in Las Vegas. Another company owned by Lopez had already been cleaning the courthouse for years and had received glowing reviews. Lopez lost the bid, and the contract was given to another company that had an official sitting on the board of directors at SourceAmerica.

Eventually, Lopez settled the Las Vegas contract dispute with SourceAmerica. As part of the settlement, SourceAmerica agreed to treat Lopez’s company more fairly, even appointing their top lawyer, Jean Robinson, to work with him.

But Lopez said his company was blackballed instead and received no more contracts. Lopez sued SourceAmerica again, claiming it violated the settlement agreement, and that claim is now ongoing in the courts.

Lopez became so disgusted with how corrupt the process was that he began working with federal investigators and secretly recorded conversations between himself and Robinson.

What is AbilityOne? The AbilityOne program was first created with ambitious, altruistic goals by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress in 1938 to help give jobs to the blind.

Those recordings, which CNN obtained independently, are now part of the federal investigation, having been requested under the grand jury subpoena.

The recordings are striking, among other reasons, because Robinson compared her company’s leadership to the leadership of the mafia.

“They’re like – they’re like the mafia, I mean, and they pride themselves in it. They don’t care,” Robinson is heard saying in one part of the recordings.

“You know, we are dealing with the mafia here, the old – the old SourceAmerica mafia,” she said in another recording.

On the recordings, Robinson confides she is nervous about being set up by a board of directors she claims has been fraudulently awarding contracts for decades.

“People have been doing it for so many years, and they’re not going to stop,” she said. “They’re just – it’s like an addiction. They’re just, so much time has passed, they’ve been getting away with it for, you know, for what, 25 years, and they don’t know how to do it different.”

Officials at SourceAmerica and AbilityOne repeatedly declined interviews with CNN, issuing statements denying fraud, corruption, cronyism, bid rigging, or illegal activity.

The recordings of Robinson, SourceAmerica writes, are “factually inaccurate and untrue.” The statement notes that Lopez, head of what it calls a “disgruntled” nonprofit, is suing SourceAmerica. The statement goes on to say “SourceAmerica is continuing to vigorously defend itself against these unfounded allegations.”",2016-01-21 00:00:00

Story highlights More than two dozen students have died because of hazing since 2008 CNN has learned that in five hazing-related deaths, institutions knew there was trouble before the incidents

(CNN) —

Nolan Burch’s parents didn’t know what West Virginia University knew – that the fraternity their son was pledging had a history of bad behavior and was about to lose its charter.

Tucker Hipps’ parents didn’t know what Clemson University knew – that there were an unprecedented number of fraternity violations happening in the weeks their son pledged.

And Marquise Braham’s parents didn’t know what they say Penn State University allegedly knew – that there were concerns about their son’s well-being in the days leading up to his suicide.

All three sets of parents now believe they were kept in the dark by institutions they trusted to care for their sons.

The Burch, Hipps and Braham families share a common sadness – their sons are dead, lost to what they believe was hazing-related behavior. They’re three of the more than two dozen students who have died because of hazing at U.S. colleges and universities since 2008.

And, CNN has learned, through record requests and other sources, that in five hazing-related deaths in as many years, institutions knew there was trouble before the deadly incidents happened.

’Occurrences of concern’

Nowhere on West Virginia University’s website did it say that Kappa Sigma fraternity had a history of, as the school now puts it, “occurrences of concern” – specifically referring to the fraternity “behaving inappropriately and hosting an unsanctioned event.” The fraternity was also warned about overcrowding in its off-campus residence.

Burch, a WVU freshman, died following a fraternity hazing event in November 2014. His blood alcohol content was measured at 0.493, more than six times the legal limit to drive. His death led to the suspension of all Greek activities at WVU and criminal charges against two Kappa Sigma brothers.

Two days before the event, where police say Burch and others were blindfolded and forced to drink liquor, the national office of Kappa Sigma notified WVU that it was pulling the charter of the local fraternity chapter. According to a statement given to CNN, the national office directed the local chapter to stop holding functions. But that directive was ignored, according to the fraternity’s national office.

“They’d been in so much trouble they (the national office) put cameras in the fraternity house,” Burch’s mother, Kim Burch, told CNN. “The frat actually installed cameras.”

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

Kim and T.J. Burch say their 18-year-old son was not aware of the fraternity’s troubles when he decided to pledge. No one told him, and no one told his parents either.

“We had no idea, unfortunately, until Nolan passed, that there had been so many problems,” Kim Burch said. “It’s sad. It’s really sad. If we had known this was going on, we would have never let him join this fraternity.”

’Unprecedented conduct issues’

That same semester, Tucker Hipps’ family had no idea that Clemson University was having a serious problem with fraternities. The university was considering a moratorium on all fraternity events, but decided just three days before Hipps died to hold off.

It would later come out that Sigma Phi Epsilon violated five rules while Hipps was pledging, including violations related to hazing, harm to person, alcohol and organizational conduct. The university did not answer when asked by CNN if officials were aware of those five SigEp violations prior to Hipps’ death.

Hipps, 19, died after he fell, jumped or was pushed off a bridge during a predawn run that was against the fraternity’s hazing policy. There’s an open criminal investigation and the family is suing the university and three fraternity members, who all have denied knowing how he died.

His parents say it was not for lack of trying that they did not know about the fraternity’s problems.

Hipps’ father, in particular, was opposed to his son joining a fraternity at Clemson.

“His dad was totally against it in the beginning,” his mother said earlier this year. Cindy Hipps said she’d done her due diligence, even attending a Greek orientation meeting, which she said put her mind at ease.

“After that class I felt better about it,” she said. “They said kids in frats have better time management skills, set study times, did it as a group activity. Those kids had higher grade point averages. All the things a mother wants to hear, I heard. I convinced his dad to let him do it. Never once did I ever feel like my child would be harmed in any way.”

When she checked out Clemson’s Greek life website, she saw only positive information, such as links to the average GPAs of each fraternity and sorority. There were two references to hazing policy, but nothing that explained which fraternities or sororities had been cited for violating those rules.

But at that time, Clemson officials were concerned about “unprecedented conduct issues over the course of first 3 weeks of school,” at several of the school’s fraternities, according to internal documents obtained by CNN.

After Hipps’ death, Clemson added a list of suspended fraternities to its website.

If Hipps’ already-apprehensive parents had known what was going on at Clemson, they say, they would have pulled their son out of Greek life immediately.

Dangers are not myths

West Virginia University, Clemson and Penn State are not the only universities that brag about philanthropy, brotherhood and connections for life on their Greek life websites. Most schools list only the positives.

Clemson’s says “Greek organizations do hold social events, but most of these do not include alcohol.”

Penn State’s goes as far as to say: “For many parents, the fraternity and sorority community reminds them of images of the movie Animal House. There are many myths about the fraternity and sorority community, but the reality is that men and women in fraternities and sororities are committed to their academics, volunteer their time in the community, develop and strengthen their leadership skills, and form a campus network with other fraternity and sorority members.”

That kind of language outrages Doug Fierberg, an attorney for the Braham family, who recently sued Penn State on the family’s behalf and who has handled dozens of university misconduct cases in his career.

“The dangers of fraternities are not myths. They are reality,” Fierberg said. “The failure by universities to tell the truth about the risks facing students in fraternities specifically related to hazing misuse and abuse of alcohol and other misconduct is the new battleground.”

“It needs to be changed nationally, because parents and students are entitled to timely and accurate information about the risks they face. And universities have no basis, morally or legally, to withhold that information from the university community,” he said.

Some universities don’t post a hazing policy on their Greek sites. For example, at West Virginia University, it’s posted separately on the campus police site. (West Virginia University told CNN it is considering a number of changes, including “better and more timely communication.”)

Others have listed it in online FAQs, several clicks away from the positives.

There are very few universities that list fraternity infractions on their websites, and even when they do, it’s often difficult to determine what the infractions really mean.

For example, after the 2008 alcohol poisoning death of Brett Griffin, 18, at the University of Delaware, Fierberg sued on behalf of the family and forced Delaware to change its Greek life site to list violations. But the list is vague, just listing things like “multiple violations” or “social policy violations” or “hazing/alcohol” without details of the incidents.

“You’re looking at best practices,” Fierberg said, referring to the University of Delaware site. “What’s ‘multiple violations’? Were people hurt? Was a student hospitalized? What does it take to get suspended?”

Northern Illinois University adopted a policy of putting sanctions on its website after the 2012 death of David Bogenberger, a 19-year-old pledge who was forced to drink alcohol and died. (Twenty-two brothers from the Phi Kappa Alpha fraternity were criminally charged and sentenced to two years of court supervision, plus community service.) Three months after his death, NIU made the change, but the list isn’t on the Greek life website – and it’s so hard to find, CNN had to ask the university to point out where it is. (It’s on a separate page, one for the Office of Community Standards & Student Conduct.)

from Twitter David Bogenberger

The relationship between universities and fraternities can be confusing, since many of them reside off-campus and are chartered by national organizations. But Fierberg said universities violate their duties to students and parents when they create websites about Greek life and only include feel-good information, instead of an accurate and complete picture.

And national fraternities are no better.

The only major fraternity that lists its violations is Sigma Alpha Epsilon, according to Fierberg, and that’s because he sued SAE after the 2008 death of a fraternity pledge at California Polytechnic State University and forced it to list prior violations online.

Carson Starkey, 18, died of alcohol poisoning following an event where pledges were forced to drink alcohol, vomit, and drink some more. The SAE chapter at Cal Poly had a prior drug violation before the death, according to Cal Poly.

“(Universities) won’t give you the full information because it will confirm that what you believe is right,” Fierberg said. “Of course you have a zero tolerance policy. (Hazing is) illegal. … But why wouldn’t you tell parents it’s still going on?”

Fierberg said he suspects that the universities don’t even write their own language for these Greek life information sites, since many of them look the same. In fact, a Google search of “myth” and “Greek life” and “hazing” and “.edu” shows nearly identical definitions of hazing on the websites of dozens of schools.

Mental health emergencies

Marquise Braham jumped off the roof of a Marriott in Nassau County, New York, in March of 2014, the same year that Hipps and Burch died. A source close to the case says there was evidence of alcohol-fueled physical and sexual hazing prior to Braham’s suicide.

from Facebook Marquise Braham

Fierberg is representing Braham’s family in its lawsuit against Penn State.

Fierberg claims the university was aware there were “serious concerns” about the “well-being and psychological health” of Braham, 18, in the days leading up to his suicide.

Phi Sigma Kappa told CNN it hasn’t seen the lawsuit and will not comment.

The police chief in Logan Township, Pennsylvania, where the satellite campus he attended is located, told local reporters that Braham had discussed hazing at his fraternity with an aunt and with several friends. The case is under investigation by the state attorney general, but no charges have been filed. The fraternity was suspended. Penn State said it couldn’t comment on Braham’s death, because of his family’s pending lawsuit, but admitted there are times when the university reaches out to parents to notify them of harmful situations.

“Emergency in this context includes mental health emergencies as well,” university spokeswoman Lisa Powers said in an email. “In general, and in accordance with privacy laws and practices, when we have a student emergency we balance the critical nature/seriousness of the situation with the student’s privacy rights as we make the decision to contact parents, or not.”

Many universities say they alert parents of health risks, such as when a student contracts a contagious disease, but there is no such pattern of reporting when it comes to other potential threats, like hazing.

In addition to Hipps and Burch, there is the 2010 death of Samuel Mason, 20, who was allegedly made to drink a bottle of liquor in an hour while pledging Tau Kappa Epsilon at Radford University in Virginia. Radford University says that chapter of TKE had been found in violation of university policy earlier that year for serving alcohol to minors at a fraternity social event. His family sued and settled with the national fraternity and several of the local chapter’s members.

And the death of Armando Villa, a 19-year-old at California State University-Northridge, pledging Pi Kappa Phi, who died during a hazing-related 18-mile August hike where, his family lawsuit alleges, he and other pledges weren’t given enough water. His fraternity had been cited for not completing required education programs and for holding unregistered events, and had just been reinstated after a suspension when the hike took place. A spokesman for the family says his mother, Betty Serrato, didn’t know about the suspension and says that if she had, she would have tried to talk her son out of pledging that fraternity.

Neither Radford or CSUN has sanctions posted on its website, although CSUN told CNN it is considering putting them online.

“It’s sad. It’s really sad,” Kim Burch said. “If we had known this was going on, we would have never let him join this fraternity. I never in my life thought I was sending a 17-year-old kid off to end up two months later gone. It’s repulsive. He would have been better off joining the Marines and going to war.”",2015-11-02 00:00:00

David Daleiden wanted to show exactly what a 19-week-old aborted fetus, being held in the hands of a medical technician, looked like. The problem was he didn’t have that picture. So he went to the Internet, found something close and inserted it into his documentary.

The photo, two cupped hands holding a tiny male fetus, appeared on screen as dramatic music played. Against this backdrop, a medical technician detailed how she was present when an intact 19-week gestated fetus was aborted at a Planned Parenthood clinic and, she says, harvested for tissue samples.

Daleiden’s video failed to mention that the photo and the story do not match.

Abortion photo actually stillborn child

The photo was not an aborted fetus at a Planned Parenthood clinic. It was the stillborn child of Alexis Fretz, whose son was stillborn in 2013. Fretz took the photo and posted it on the Internet to memorialize the son she named Walter.

Without Fretz’s knowledge, Daleiden and his two-man documentary group called the Center for Medical Progress plucked that photo from her web page and dropped it into his anti-Planned Parenthood documentary.

“Was it clear?” Fretz asks herself in a CNN interview, “No it was not clear. Was it deceitful? I don’t know that.”

Daleiden told CNN the fact that the photo is not an actual photo of an aborted fetus makes no difference. He insists the fetus is the same age as the one referred to in his film, and he used it only as an illustration.

Misleading video cited in Republican debate

Daleiden also is being criticized for a second, potentially misleading use of video that has found its way into the Republican presidential campaign. GOP candidate Carly Fiorina cited a portion of the Center for Medical Progress videos in which an intact fetus kicks its left leg and moves an arm shortly after being aborted.

Fiorina described the video during CNN’s Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential library on September 16, using the horrific image in her call for an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

In an interview in Southern California earlier this month, Daleiden now admits he has no information on where the video was actually taken. There is no evidence it was taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

Daleiden says the image came from an outside source, an anti-abortion group called the Center For Bioethical Reform and he doesn’t know its origin beyond that. A spokesman for the group tells CNN it won’t disclose the location either, only that the video in question was paid for. Despite its source, Daleiden again insists the video is only used as an illustration of what an intact aborted fetus would look like, not the actual fetus referred to in his film.

Critics call videos heavily edited, discredited

The two examples of misleading pictures and video have allowed Planned Parenthood and its supporters to label the Center for Medical Progress’s entire production a fraud.

Dawn Laguens, an executive vice president with Planned Parenthood, repeated the defense the women’s health group and its many supporters have been trying to convey since the first of the Center for Medical Progress’s nine videos began to be released online.

“All of the tapes and footage David Daleiden has released out into the world has been heavily edited,” Laguens told CNN. “And I think pretty thoroughly discredited.”

Daleiden insists the two uses of video and photos are not misleading, and says the entire controversy has been manufactured by Planned Parenthood and its “allies in the mainstream media” in order to divert attention from the main point of his documentary: that Planned Parenthood uses aborted fetal tissue as a revenue source.

Planned Parenthood: Fast facts and revealing numbers

Planned Parenthood ends payments

The Center for Medical Progress spent several years taping Planned Parenthood employees, medical directors and some of its affiliate partners discussing the technique, costs and reimbursement payments for the harvesting of fetal tissue samples for scientific research.

The filming was done without knowledge of those speaking. In several instances, CMP argues that Planned Parenthood representatives appear to be bargaining, negotiating and detailing the best ways to collect or “harvest” aborted fetuses for maximum financial gain.

In one episode, Dr. Mary Gatter, a medical director for Planed Parenthood, is filmed during a meal discussing her proposal that each tissue sample harvested should fetch a $75 charge.

Since selling fetal tissue samples is illegal, Planned Parenthood has been quick to label the transactions as reimbursement costs and that they were made only at a tiny fraction of the organization’s 700 clinics and affiliates. Planned Parenthood executives continue to claim the videos are heavily edited, taken out of context and deceptive.

But last week Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept any reimbursement costs at any of its clinics for the transfer of fetal tissue-samples. In a letter to the National Institutes of Health, Planned Parenthood’s president defended her organization and insisted all transactions in the past were legal. But says the new change in policy was being taken “…in order to take away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda.”

Contacted after the announcement, Daleiden says the sudden change in policy is an admission that he and his videos were right.

“If the money Planned Parenthood has been receiving for baby body parts were truly legitimate ‘reimbursement,’ why cancel it?” Daleiden wrote in a statement to CNN. “This proves what the Center for Medical Progress has been saying all along – Planned Parenthood incurs no actual costs, and the payments for harvested fetal parts have always been an extra profit margin.”

Sources: Disabled work program mired in fraud,"Story highlights CNN exclusive: AbilityOne and SourceAmerica are under investigation AbilityOne program funnels about $3 billion per year of taxpayer money to fund contracts for goods and services Sources say the agency is allowing jobs to be taken away from disabled people

(CNN) —

The nation’s premier federal program that provides work for people who are severely disabled is mired in widespread corruption, financial fraud and violations of the law, numerous sources tell CNN. And instead of helping the severely disabled find work, the taxpayer-funded agency is at times allowing jobs to be taken away from the disabled, the sources say.

AbilityOne, along with the nonprofit agency that manages its program for the severely disabled, SourceAmerica, are being investigated by authorities for illegal operations, financial fraud, mismanagement, operating in violation of the law, steering of contracts, and possibly obstruction of justice. Several inside sources tell CNN the program is among the worst cases of its type they’ve ever seen in a federal agency.

CNN has learned the U.S. Department of Justice has begun its own investigation into the various allegations. In addition, at least four separate inspectors general offices have active investigations into AbilityOne and SourceAmerica. The OIG from the General Services Administration, Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration and the State Department are among those investigating; their investigation is being led by the State Department IG.

What is AbilityOne? The AbilityOne program was first created with ambitious, altruistic goals by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress in 1938 to help give jobs to the blind.

The AbilityOne program funnels about $3 billion per year of taxpayer money to fund contracts for goods and services across the country. For a company to get a contract with AbilityOne, 75% of that company’s work must be performed by blind or severely disabled employees, who cannot work in a normal job.

But CNN has learned that as many as half the companies contracting with SourceAmerica under AbilityOne may be operating in violation of the law, without enough severely disabled employees, according to sources with knowledge of the program. There are no such allegations of wrongdoing with AbilityOne’s contracts for blind people.

What this means is the program responsible for making sure severely disabled people are being hired with taxpayer money through federal contracts is not enforcing or following the law, according to numerous inside sources with knowledge of the organization.

AbilityOne is run by a commission made up of presidential appointees. While they must approve all contracts, sources tell CNN they are essentially a “rubber stamp,” for the referrals sent to them by SourceAmerica, which essentially operates independently with contracts for the severely disabled. So, one key allegation is that SourceAmerica, a nonprofit agency with virtually no oversight other than AbilityOne, largely decides how roughly $2.3 billion in U.S. taxpayer money is spent, according to numerous sources.

“The contracts are now being funneled to a very small group of 10 large companies that are getting way more than their fair share,” said former congressional investigator Rich Beutel, who now lobbies for companies in the industry, including one that’s suing SourceAmerica.

Beutel and numerous other sources tell CNN the staffers who are essentially handing out federal contracts at SourceAmerica are heavily influenced by top officials there, and those top SourceAmerica officials are often connected to the very businesses that get the contracts – sometimes even in top leadership.

Several lawsuits have been filed in recent years accusing AbilityOne and SourceAmerica of awarding contracts not on the basis of merit, but rather through unfair influence by decision-makers who have interest in the outcome.

“So that you have actual advisers and board members in these private organizations who are themselves business owners; and so they can award themselves potentially contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Beutel. “It’s a perfect setup for waste and abuse,” he said.

The agency denies those accusations. “No one involved in making award recommendations to the commission is employed by an organization seeking those contracts,” read the statement sent to CNN. “We want to be very clear, SourceAmerica board members are not involved in the evaluation of contract bids or recommendations to the AbilityOne Commission.”

Disabled losing jobs

It took Randall Love years to find work after a tumor on his spine left him nearly paralyzed in 2008. The IT professional struggled through physical therapy to even be able to move in his home, and he can’t travel to hold down a regular job. He finally found work at home through an AbilityOne contract, and it changed everything for him.

“It gives me … a sense of being worthwhile, a sense of being able to contribute to things, a sense of being able to help others,” said Love. “I get up just like everybody else in the morning. And I go to work, too. I’m not disabled. That’s why I say it’s the cure for me,” he said.

But Love and numerous other disabled people were left jobless when the company that hired them, NTI, lost its AbilityOne contract to a company named Peckham Industries. NTI officials appealed the contract award multiple times detailing what they call “overwhelming evidence” that Peckham would “not be in compliance” with the 75% requirement under law.

Mary Joan Willard, the executive director of Boston-based NTI, blames the government for not having a system of checking whether a company is compliant. Willard and NTI have sued the U.S. government, and by extension, AbilityOne and SourceAmerica, in the contract dispute.

Peckham disputes NTI’s allegations, saying in a statement to CNN, “We are now put in a position of being a victim of false allegations by an unsuccessful bidder. … The fact is that Peckham EXCEEDS the 75% requirement with a proven record of employment of severely disabled about 80%. Peckham has consistently maintained the required ratio for persons with severe disabilities served through the AbilityOne program.” When CNN asked for proof of the employment numbers, Peckham declined, citing ongoing litigation.

CNN has been told by multiple sources there is no real verification process in AbilityOne or Source America to determine whether severely disabled workers are being hired in the proper ratio and the contracts are operating legally. “Their definition of ‘verified’ is they look at a piece of paper that Peckham has signed saying, ‘We are in compliance … these people are severely disabled.’ And that, to me, is not verification,” said Willard.

Meanwhile, workers like Love are furious they lost work. “I tell my kids this all the time – that you always must do the right thing,” said Love. “Doing the right thing … doesn’t mean that you put 16 disabled people out of work. Doing the right thing also means … that you don’t replace them with people who don’t have disabilities.”

Numerous sources with direct knowledge of AbilityOne and Source America contracts tell CNN there are many companies contracting through AbilityOne and Source America across the country that do not meet the government’s rule of having a 75% severely disabled workforce, made up of people who cannot perform other jobs.

“The majority of the individuals that were being hired were not severely disabled,” one inside source told CNN. This source worked for years as a hiring manager inside one of the big contractors that gets many AbilityOne contracts, through SourceAmerica. This person knows the program very well, but asked CNN not to reveal their identity because they still have close contacts in that world. The source cited numerous examples of contracts operating illegally and out of compliance.

“I would say in my experience in the AbilityOne contracts that I worked on, maybe 10 to 20 percent were truly severely disabled; they truly did not have the ability to find gainful employment elsewhere. Everybody else – they were capable of finding employment elsewhere,” the source said. What the source witnessed would be illegal, because the contracts would be out of compliance.

Asked if anyone in the program ever actually checked to objectively verify if the contracts were operating legally with the right number of severely disabled people, the anonymous source told CNN: “Not that I’m aware of. I mean, we tracked numbers for our own record-keeping to ensure that we met that 75%. But as far as any type of documentation being turned over to AbilityOne to actually show, ‘Hey, these individuals have a severe disability,’ I’m not aware that that ever took place.”

“As long as you have a report that says 75% of my staff is disabled, there’s no other checking,” the source said, adding the program is both a “ripoff” of taxpayers and also an affront to disabled people who want and need to work in the special contracts.

CNN heard similar allegations from numerous sources across the country. SourceAmerica says they conduct on-site visits, but according to their statement: “SourceAmerica staff does not determine compliance; only the U.S. AbilityOne Commission is authorized to do so.”

Even on the rare occasions when companies are cited by AbilityOne officials for not being in compliance, nothing happens, numerous sources told CNN. In recent years, CNN has learned, at least 80 letters were sent to contractors from AbilityOne officials stating the contracts were in violation of the law and out of compliance, and demanding they submit explanations. But only about half the companies even bothered to respond or explain why they were operating illegally.

Have a tip? The Office of Inspector General has a tip line for anyone with information about AbilityOne or SourceAmerica. It is oighotline@state.gov or 800-409-9926.

What’s more, none of the companies operating illegally were disciplined in any way, according to sources. And these letters were only sent to the violators that self-reported their low numbers out of compliance, or where the small AbilityOne team tasked with overseeing the enormous program managed to discover violations.

CNN has also learned there are many contracts operating across the country that have not been seen by any AbilityOne compliance officials in years and even decades in some cases, despite the fact they are supposed to be seen regularly. And sources tell CNN the legally required documentation on severely disabled workers is rarely completed and turned in to AbilityOne officials by contractors.

The contracts are awarded for all kinds of products that are made through the program and can be seen in the comprehensive online catalog. AbilityOne workers also do many services with the contracts, such as answer phones at call centers, janitorial cleaning and laundry work, often at government buildings or on military bases.

While CNN has learned there are at least four inspectors general now with active investigations, none of them is officially tasked with oversight of the program or agency, and none has complete authority over it. They are pursuing it because of concerns that have been raised about specific contracts under their jurisdiction.",2015-07-27 00:00:00
"Athletes allege abuse, racism at U. of Illinois","Story highlights Athletes at the University of Illinois accuse coaches of harassment CNN spoke to 15 recently departed players on the football and women's basketball team The university's athletic director acknowledges the allegations are serious and call into question the culture of the program

(CNN) —

They called it the “dog pound.”

It was a separate practice for women’s basketball players at the University of Illinois, a majority of them black, where athletes were often allegedly harassed and attacked for things that had nothing to do with basketball.

Like the neighborhoods where they grew up. Or their family life.

It was common, these women told CNN, for an assistant coach to refer to race, and to tell them their “culture” was “poison” or “toxic” to the starting team, which was predominantly white. During road games, the players say they were segregated – black players separated from the white ones in hotel rooms.

It was so bad, the women said, four players from this past season transferred out of the program at the University of Illinois to other schools.

Nearby, at the university’s Memorial Stadium, some members of the football team say they were being harassed too. They recalled two instances where players were physically hit by their coach.

Another player, with Type 1 diabetes, said he was shamed about his weight.

CNN has spoken to 15 recently departed players on the football and women’s basketball teams, and they allege a wide range of misconduct and persistent bullying of athletes by coaches.

In addition, players and their families have complained to CNN that they were pressured to play through injuries that go far beyond the typical tough nature of college sports. In one case, a women’s basketball player says she was forced to play with an injured toe that ended up being diagnosed as a broken foot. Athletes on the football team also complained that injuries were not taken seriously – one recalling a time when coaches threatened from the sidelines that he would lose his scholarship as he limped across the field with a knee injury.

Overall, students and parents on both teams say there was a culture of coaches bullying students, with frequent threats to take away their scholarships even though university policy says an athlete can’t lose his or her scholarship because of injury or performance in sport.

The university’s athletic director, Mike Thomas, acknowledged that the allegations are serious and call into question the culture of the program.

“I was certainly troubled by all the allegations. And those allegations don’t match our core values,” he said. “Certainly our student athletes need to be in an environment that’s safe, that’s healthy, that takes their well-being as primary importance.”

Women’s basketball head coach Matt Bollant and head football coach Tim Beckman declined to comment through a university spokeswoman.

“Look at what the university has to lose,” said Lydia Tuck, the mother of one former women’s basketball player. “I’m sure they’re worried about Title IX funding. I’m sure they hope that we go away.”

Racism alleged on women’s basketball team

The women’s basketball team lost four girls to transfer this year – all for the same reasons: They allege pervasive emotional abuse.

Eight former players – seven of them have since sued the university – talked to CNN, and all said that assistant coach Mike Divilbiss verbally attacked players daily, going after them for personal issues such as learning disabilities, family life or the neighborhood in which they grew up. Divilbiss could not be reached for comment.

“The way he would attack you personally was just horrible,” said Jacqui Grant, a former player.

“He came after my character,” said former player Alexis Smith, claiming that Divilbiss reprimanded her for moving into the same apartment as two of her teammates who were Bollant’s recruits. “He said, ‘I feel like you are trying to poison these girls. Why did you even move in with them? You are trying to poison them.’ “

“When I tried to defend myself,” she added, “he was like, ‘Don’t try to come after me, I’m the wrong person.’ “

Kierra Morris, who left the team after being put on medical disability, said the coaches told her they didn’t want her “culture carrying over” to their new recruits.

Another former player, Amarah Coleman said that race was a constant underlying distinction and that Divilbiss often said things like, “you know how black people play.”

And another former player, Taylor Tuck, said Divilbiss made a comment about three black players sitting together at a restaurant, saying, “All the black girls are sitting together, that’s segregated.”

Divilbiss left the university after coming to what administrators call a “mutual understanding” with Bollant, following complaints from some parents, but Bollant remains in his position.

Several former players or their parents told CNN that separate practices were held for the team – one practice group was majority black, and called “the dog pound,” which the players understood to mean they were not in favor. The other practice group was majority white, made up of the starters on the team. In addition, tension between the groups was encouraged, parents wrote in letters of complaint to the university in April.

The players said those in the “dog pound” were called “crabs,” which, on a conference call, seven of the players explained like this: “Crabs can never get out of a bucket because they always pull each other down. That is how he explained it in practice. … They all just climb on top of each other and pull each other down. Like, bums, we are just dragging everybody down.”

Coleman said she felt uncomfortable when her team was preparing to play one that was majority African-American, “because coach Divilbiss would single out the blacks on the team to talk about what the other black team was thinking. … The division of the team during that time made it feel like coach was thinking all blacks think alike.”

She continued with more examples: “In practice when a black player would do a certain move, he (Divilbiss) would make a comment stating ‘that’s the West Side coming out’ (referring to Chicago’s predominantly black West Side). People should be proud of where they are from, but coach was saying it to make fun of where they are from.”

Recruitment by a previous coach

Six of the former players who spoke to CNN said that Divilbiss made several comments that singled out the black players who were primarily recruited by the previous coach, also an African-American, from the white players who were primarily recruited by Bollant.

The players say race wasn’t the only factor that led to their mistreatment; they say they believe it also had to do with the fact that they were recruited by a previous coach.

“It was a combination. Like you were African-American, and you weren’t recruited by them,” former player Nia Oden said.

In their lawsuit, and in interviews with CNN, the women said they were divided by race when sharing hotel rooms during road games.

After the women’s parents complained in April, the school did an internal investigation through its diversity council, and “preliminary findings” found no wrongdoing when it came to the allegations of racism and bullying.

That led to an outcry from former players and their parents. And in response to them and to questions from CNN, the university announced five days later that it had hired a Chicago law firm to “finalize the preliminary review” that found no wrongdoing.

“There’s no rush to judgment. You know we will go through an investigative process, and when that process is complete we will look at the next steps,” said Thomas, the university’s athletic director. “… I think you and I could be watching practice, and you could hear a coach say something to two different kids, those two different kids might take it a different way and you and I might take it a different way. So I think for coaches, not just at the University of Illinois but across the country, these are the kind of things that we’re going to be paying attention to moving forward.”

The university has also hired a separate law firm to look at the claims of medical mistreatment on different teams. Allegations now include a lawsuit filed on June 8 by a former Illinois soccer player who says her concussion was mishandled.

The suit says the university failed to follow its own protocol for handling concussions when defender Casey Conine was injured, returning her to play before doctors cleared her.

’A culture of mental and emotional abuse’

Divilbiss’ departure comes after three sets of parents wrote letters to the administration in late April.

In one of the letters, Tuck, the former player, and her husband wrote that bullying and racial tension on the team are systematic and “epidemic,” and they accused Bollant, the women’s basketball head coach, of creating “a culture of mental and emotional abuse.”

The family of another player, Taylor Gleason, wrote that she was “bullied and demoralized daily” and was forced to play with an injured toe, which later was diagnosed as a broken foot.

“She’s just happy to be at a new school and starting over,” her father told CNN later. “Just happy to be out of there.”

Many of the players who left are now playing at other schools, and they said they are having much different and much better experiences.

Tom Grusecki, the stepfather of one former player, wrote in a letter to the school that Divilbiss belittled his daughter in front of the team because of her estranged relationship with her father and because of her dyslexia.

More than one player said they became so depressed, “it hurt to get out of bed.”

“The things they said were so personal, attacking, that they would single you out and you felt you were alone,” Gleason said.

Sarah Livingston, who transferred after the 2014 season, said the final straw, for her, was when another coach just turned away after one of Divilbiss’ rants.

“That kind of embodied the whole attitude of everyone that wasn’t Divilbiss,” she said.

“He wouldn’t stand up for us. He wouldn’t tell coach D to stop. Coach Bollant would be quiet and continue with practice,” Smith said.

Thomas, the university’s athletic director, said the university is reevaluating its practice of allowing head coaches to do most of the vetting of assistants they bring in.

The university responded by saying that it’s disappointed the lawsuit came before the findings of its internal review and that Thomas has asked staff to closely monitor team activities in the meantime.

“I cannot stress enough that anytime we learn that a student feels the experience at Illinois isn’t excellent, we take those concerns seriously. We intended that through the external review process the student-athletes and their families would help us better understand their concerns and perceptions,” Chancellor Phyllis Wise said in a statement.

Many players and parents told CNN they won’t be happy as long as Bollant remains. One said, “When you are the head coach, you should stop that when you see it. If you can’t stop bullying amongst your own staff, that is a problem.”

Tuck, whose daughter graduated from the program, said the behavior of the coaching staff changed drastically when Bollant was hired after her daughter’s freshman year. And, she said, the attitude of the coaches is drastically different from those of her other daughter, who plays under much better circumstances at Connecticut.

Football allegations

The alleged bullying at the University of Illinois wasn’t isolated to one program or one coach. There are also allegations of wrongdoing in the football program.

Recently graduated football player Kenny Knight and three other former players who spoke to CNN say they witnessed two incidents in the past two years in which head coach Tim Beckman was physically rough with players. One player is still on the team and declined through his teammates to talk about what happened. But witnesses said that at the start of one practice, the player ran onto the field with his helmet unbuckled, and Beckman ran over to him, grabbed his face mask and jerked his head back and forth, yelling at him.

In 2013, Knight says, a similar thing happened to him. He says Beckman grabbed and tackled him from behind, throwing him to the ground during a practice. Two former teammates who witnessed the incident backed him up.

They say it happened after Knight was hit “dirty” by another player with his head down – something that’s prohibited in college football.

“I immediately got in his face about it,” Knight said of the player who hit him. “Before I had the chance to lift a finger, in a matter of seconds, I was grabbed by my shoulder and thrown on the ground. I was livid, I thought I was going to look up and see one of my teammates had thrown me down, but I looked up and saw Tim Beckman staring in my face. I was shocked. I don’t think I uttered a word.”

The university says Beckman thought he was breaking up a fight; Knight and several other players who witnessed the incident said there was no physical fight happening when Beckman hit Knight. Knight’s father said the night of the incident, Beckman told him, “Kenny accidentally fell backwards over him.”

Knight and his father tried to look at the practice tape to review what happened.

“There was 35 seconds of blank screen. I could see the dial was moving to let me know that it was still playing, but there was no film to be seen. It wouldn’t play for me or for anybody else,” he said. Two other players said they, separately, also looked for the incident on the practice tape, but it was not there.

The university says the “dead time” between plays is not normally recorded during practice. Knight says Beckman called him the day after speaking to his father to apologize, but Knight never reported the incident to anyone at the university out of fear that he’d lose his scholarship. “He should never be allowed to coach again,” Knight said.

The National College Players Association is also involved, offering guidance to the players who are coming out publicly and demanding that Illinois fire all coaches involved in physical and verbal abuse.

“You can be tough as hell without abusing players,” said NCPA president Ramogi Huma. “Everywhere, coaches yell and cuss. That happens everywhere. What doesn’t happen everywhere is racism,” Huma said, referring to the women’s basketball team. “What doesn’t happen everywhere is forcing players to play through serious injuries. It’s not regular for coaches to put their hands on players – that’s not breaking up a fight, that’s starting a fight,” he said, referring to the alleged incident with the football team.

“At the end of the day, it’s about the student-athlete experience, and part of that is their safety, well-being and health,” said Thomas, the university’s athletic director. “And abuse is not acceptable. We hold our staff to a high standard. That line of what’s acceptable and not acceptable is really under the microscope right now.”

Brothers allege bullying on football team

Knight and others are speaking up after fellow former teammate Simon Cvijanovic went on Twitter in May to say that he’d been pressured by Beckman to go back on the field too soon after knee surgery and to play through a shoulder injury.

Instead, he quit the team, started the hashtag #BanBeckman and inspired several more teammates to speak up, including Knight, and former player Nick North, who told CNN that he, too, was pushed back into practice after hurting a knee ligament.

“They kept saying, ‘You need to go back out there,’ even though they knew I wasn’t 100 percent,” North said. “I’d literally be limping while running, and you could see it. … They were like, if you can’t do this, you’re going to have to leave. You can’t play here. We’re going to take your scholarship.” North graduated in December.

All the players CNN spoke to said that many more stories like these exist, but players are afraid to speak up because they’re still on the team.

“WHEN @coachbeckman is fired you’ll hear plenty more stories but right now he’s dangling scholarships like a carrot,” Cvijanovic tweeted.

WHEN @coachbeckman is fired you'll hear plenty more stories but right now he's dangling scholarships like a carrot — Simon Cvijanović (@SimonCvijanovic) May 10, 2015

He later said, “They act like our bodies are just disposable and we should feel that way also or else we’re not team players. … There’s nowhere to turn to so Twitter is where I went.”

He says Beckman threatened to say bad things about his character to National Football League scouts unless he returned to the field after injuries. Once, he says, he was pressured to return two weeks after an ankle injury that his doctor told him needed a six- to eight-week recovery.

His younger brother, who also played football but quit the team, struggled as well. A Type 1 diabetic, Peter Cvijanovic had trouble gaining weight and says he was bullied daily by coaches for it.

“They made him step on the scale three to five times a day,” Simon Cvijanovic said. “Every time he walked by, coach would make him step up on the scale, and Peter would hang his head and get up on the scale. We were both throwing up in the morning from anxiety – me from my knee and him because of the weight issue.”

The university says it cannot discuss the Cvijanovic brothers’ or Nick North’s allegations in detail because of privacy laws.

Thomas said he had not been aware of many of the allegations until being asked for comment by CNN, adding that he would ask the firm investigating to expand its scope.

“Anytime you receive these types of allegations, it brings you great concern,” he said, later adding, “Here at the University of Illinois, the health and well-being of our student athletes is our number one priority. … Anytime anything rises to a level of a student athlete being mistreated, I would address it immediately.”",2015-07-07 00:00:00
Government says four cancer charities are shams,"Visitors try out Windows enabled smartphones at the Microsoft stand at the 2013 CeBIT technology trade fair on March 5, 2013 in Hanover, Germany. CeBIT will be open March 5-9.

Story highlights Government says donors gave $187 million over four years to support luxury lifestyles, private fundraisers Donated funds used for luxury cruises, trips to Las Vegas, shopping FTC and 50 state regulators say charities committed nationwide fraud

(CNN) —

In a rare joint action with attorneys general for each of the 50 states, the Federal Trade Commission says four cancer charities run by extended members of the same family conned donors out of $187 million from 2008 through 2012 and spent almost nothing to help actual cancer patients.

Each of the charities charged were the subject of extensive reporting by CNN in 2013. And in each instance, none of the four charities would comment. We were ordered out of the building at the Cancer Fund of America in Knoxville, Tennessee, and were the object of an obscene gesture by the CEO of The Breast Cancer Society in Mesa, Arizona.

The Cancer Fund of America is run by James Reynolds Sr. His son James Reynolds Jr. is the CEO of the Breast Cancer Society. Another charity, the Children’s Cancer Fund of America, is run by Rose Perkins, the ex-wife of the elder James Reynolds. He’s also the CEO of the fourth charity, Cancer Support Services.

The government says the charities claimed to provide direct support for cancer patients, breast cancer patients and children with cancer.

“These were lies,” the government’s complaint says.

Jessica Rich, chief of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, says that in all, the charities spent about 97% of donations they received either on private fundraisers or on themselves. Only 3%, she says, went to help actual cancer patients.

According to the complaint, funds donated to help cancer patients instead went for personal use, in often lavish ways.

“[D]onated funds were used to pay for vehicles, personal consumer goods, college tuition, gym memberships, Jet Ski outings, dating website subscriptions, luxury cruises, and tickets to concerts and professional sporting events,” the complaint says.

“Most of what we are doing is bringing actions against fraud,” says Rich. “And this is as about as bad as it can get: taking money away from cancer victims.”

CNN Investigations: Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing

There was also what the FTC calls “rampant nepotism” at play in all of the charities. For instance, at the Breast Cancer Society, James Reynolds Jr. hired his wife, Kristina Hixson, to be his public relations manager. The complaint states that he also hired Hixson’s two sisters, her son by a previous marriage, her mother and her step-nephew. According to the complaint, Hixson’s mother had been a caterer. At the Breast Cancer Society, she was hired to write grant applications.

Moreover,on their tax returns, each charity claimed millions of dollars in donated goods shipped to overseas locations on behalf of cancer patients. The complaint says the charities never owned any of the goods in question and simply paid a fee to a private firm in South Carolina to ship the goods, called gifts-in-kind. CNN went to Guatemala in early 2014 to investigate anyone who may have received those gifts and could find no evidence that they even existed.

As a result of the complaint, two of the charities say they will close their doors. Both the Breast Cancer Society and the Children’s Cancer Fund of America are being dissolved, according to the complaint. James Reynolds Jr. faces a judgment of more than $60 million in fines and Rose Perkins, who runs the Children’s Cancer Fund of America, faces a judgment of around $30 million.

Under a proposed final order, the judgment against Reynolds Jr. will be suspended when he pays $75,000. The judgments against Children’s Cancer Fund of America will be partly met upon liquidation of its assets, and the judgment against Perkins will be suspended due to her inability to pay.

CNN Investigations: Many airport workers not screened

The FTC’s Jessica Rich, however, said there are few assets left. Government regulators will be lucky to recover $1 million, she told CNN.

As for James Reynolds Sr., he will contest the charges in the complaint, the government says. CNN hasn’t yet been able to reach attorneys for Reynolds Sr., his son or Perkins for comment, but in a message posted on the Breast Cancer Society website, Reynolds Jr. said:

“While the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.”",2015-05-19 00:00:00

Story highlights TSA received more than 30,000 claims of missing valuables between 2010-2014 Most of the missing valuables were packed in checked luggage Miami-Dade police set up hidden cameras as part of sting

(CNN) —

Inside a plane at Miami International Airport, baggage handlers are going on a shopping spree with passengers’ bags.

What they don’t know is that they are being recorded on a hidden camera. The Miami-Dade Police Department set up the camera as part of an ongoing police investigation into luggage thefts by the very airport workers who are supposed to get bags safely onto planes.

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

“It’s a problem we all face,” said police Lt. Pete Estis. “We will continue to be proactive until we can see that the claims of pilfering through luggage will actually decrease.”

Miami Aviation Director Emilio T. González said the insider theft cases “are indeed the exception among the thousands of decent, hardworking employees at MIA, and they have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for their crimes.”

And these insider thefts just don’t happen in Miami. A CNN analysis of passenger property loss claims filed with the TSA from 2010 to 2014 shows 30,621 claims of missing valuables, mostly packed in checked luggage. The rest occurred at security checkpoints. Total property loss claimed: $2.5 million.

John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York topped the list of airports with the most claims of thefts from luggage, followed by Los Angeles International, Orlando International and Miami International, according to the data.

The problem has been so serious at JFK that in 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera in a baggage hold. The camera showed baggage handlers stealing items on flights bound for Israel, including a $5,000 Seiko watch, iPhones, an iPad, cameras, gold rings and cash. Six of those arrested pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property or petty larceny and the seventh suspect’s case was sealed, according to the Queens District Attorney’s Office.

The high-profile case, though, didn’t stop the thefts. Two more baggage handlers at JFK were arrested in 2014 after authorities said they stole two designer handbags from a suitcase, and then tried to sell them on eBay.

Then, in December, seven more JFK baggage handlers were charged with stealing valuables from checked luggage. The items were stolen from suitcases of passengers traveling to or from Hawaii, Japan, Johannesburg, London, Bangkok, Dubai, Milan and various U.S. cities.

In Miami, which aggressively goes after luggage thieves, police have arrested 31 baggage handlers and ramp workers since 2012, including six so far this year.

Police set up a hidden camera inside the belly of a plane last year and caught baggage handlers rifling through luggage and stealing various items.

Another hidden camera caught a baggage handler rummaging through bags in a secure luggage room inside the airport while a security guard looked the other way.

“Insider threat is very scary for us in law enforcement, and certainly someone taking somebody’s cell phone, iPad, computer – what’s next?” Estis said.

A CNN investigation earlier this year found that Miami and Orlando are the only two major airports in the country that require employees to be screened through metal detectors. Miami even checks employees when they leave work to go into the main terminal. But that apparently hasn’t stopped the luggage thieves.

“As far as being able to get the property off the airfield, that’s a great question,” Estis said. “We have theories.”

In Los Angeles, police last year executed search warrants on 25 locations after getting complaints about thefts in two terminals. Among the valuables found were computers, watches, jewelry and cameras and designer bags. Sixteen airport workers were fired.

“We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,” said Patrick Gannon, police chief of Los Angeles International Airport.

Luggage theft could definitely lead to more serious problems, he said.

“I absolutely think that if we don’t pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism,” Gannon said.

Even the TSA has had problem employees. Since 2002, the agency has fired 513 officers for theft. It employs about 50,000 officers today, and last year screened more than 443 million checked bags and nearly 1.7 billion carry-ons.

Luggage theft isn’t confined to airport workers. Outsiders have been caught on surveillance cameras stealing luggage from carousels. CNN contacted airports around the country and found while the total thefts from carousels are relatively low, it continues to be a problem.

For example, Seattle reported 214 luggage thefts from carousels and other airport locations last year, 200 in Las Vegas, 36 in Atlanta, 35 in Phoenix, 15 at Ronald Reagan Washington National, 14 at Dulles International and 10 at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport.

"Poisoned teens struggle to eat, walk","Story highlights Family poisoned by pesticide during March vacation in U.S. Virgin Islands Methyl bromide, a restricted-use pesticide, was used at their resort

(CNN) —

As two Delaware teens recovering from pesticide poisoning struggle to eat, walk and sit up on their own, an investigation into what went wrong highlights failures on several levels, including lax oversight and a history of corruption at the U.S. Virgin Islands government agency in charge of exterminators.

The teens and their parents fell gravely ill and suffered seizures during a March vacation to St. John. The family was exposed to methyl bromide, a restricted-use pesticide. Recovery from their nerve damage has been slow and agonizing for the whole family, but it’s been the worst for the boys. The brothers were in medically induced comas for weeks. They are now conscious, family attorney James Maron said, but they are barely able to move.

Six months after the horrifying incident, their father, Steve Esmond, is slowly getting better as well, but suffers from severe tremors, struggles to speak and can’t turn the pages of a book, Maron said.

“Neurologically, it’s like being in a torture chamber,” Maron said.

Esmond and his boys are mentally “strong as an ox” and “100% cognizant,” but they are trapped in bodies badly damaged by the nerve agent, Maron said.

Prior to the incident, the boys were athletic stars at their schools. The older brother had big prospects playing lacrosse and was already touring colleges.

Their mother, Teresa Devine, had less exposure to the toxic gas than the rest of the family and has made the strongest recovery, but she spends her days and nights keeping vigil over her boys.

What is methyl bromide? Methyl bromide is a restricted-use pesticide that the U.S. EPA has considered ""highly toxic"" for more than two decades. Inhalation of methyl bromide, even short-term, can cause severe lung damage, while long-term inhalation can lead to ""neurological effects."" Studies on lab animals caused degenerative lesions in the nasal cavity and had effects on the testicles of male animals.

Source: EPA

“They’re extreme fighters, and that’s why they’re hanging on,” Maron said.

The family was on vacation at the Sirenusa resort on St. John when two employees of the local Terminix fumigated the villa below theirs March 18 with methyl bromide, even though it is not approved for residential use. After the family became ill, the Environmental Protection Agency found traces of the lethal gas in their villa.

The exposure was so significant inside the treated unit that 6 weeks after the family fell ill, dangerous amounts of methyl bromide were still being detected inside the rental villa, according to EPA documents.

Methyl bromide is incredibly toxic to humans, said Dr. Reynold Panettieri Jr., the deputy director for the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology.

“I would say the prognosis, at best, is guarded,” said Panettieri, who has not personally treated the family. “As we know the victims have been off ventilators and they’ve been improved. But if that dose, even though it appeared to be acute, was over (a period of) hours, the damage to the nerves and to the brain itself may render it irreversibly damaged.”

Maron said Terminix has agreed to enter mediation, done by Ken Feinberg, who negotiated the settlements for the victims of the September 11 attacks. Mediation begins September 28.

What went wrong

New details are emerging about the incident that so drastically sickened the Esmonds. Six others on the islands had mild symptoms of methyl bromide exposure – headache, fatigue, cough and shortness of breath – after the botched March fumigation of the Sirenusa resort. Four of those were emergency workers who helped the Esmond family, according to the EPA.

CNN has also learned that the day the pesticide was applied, an exterminator tented and taped off the treated area of the resort villa with 6-millimeter plastic that the gas should not have been able to penetrate.

A source familiar with the investigation speculated that the plastic could have come loose, and the chemical perhaps traveled through the air-conditioning system. According to documents received from the EPA in a FOIA request, the EPA also speculated about a gap in the ceiling of the lower unit’s air conditioning unit, speculating that the gas may have traveled to the upper unit. Even so, methyl bromide should not have been used on a residential building in the first place.

The pesticide manufacturer, Chemtura, told CNN that an odor is supposed to be added to methyl bromide before any use, much like the artificial odor added to natural gas so that people can detect it. But family attorney Maron said no odor was added in this instance. Terminix will not comment on that part of the investigation.

CNN previously reported that methyl bromide was used across the islands on different occasions by Terminix. Other pest control companies on the Virgin Islands were found in possession of methyl bromide and officials said they are checking records to see whether it was used improperly. Ken Mapp, the governor of the Virgin Islands, said it was.

“What these companies did or appear to have been doing is clearly a violation of the law, and they’ll be held accountable for it,” Mapp said. He said he learned his own complex was fumigated with methyl bromide in 2013.

Methyl bromide is highly restricted because it’s dangerous to the environment. It’s only legal to use for agriculture. But pesticide experts tell CNN it’s very effective on the powderpost beetle, which bores into wood and is prevalent throughout the islands. So even though it’s not legal to use it in residences, some pesticide companies apparently fumigated with it anyway, according to Mapp.

Sources tell CNN that there were two Terminix employees on the job at Sirenusa the day the Esmond family was poisoned. One, who was a Terminix salesman, has left the company. His job that day, sources say, was simply to help carry supplies.

Pesticide probed in resort illness of Delaware family

EPA

Jose Rivera, the applicator who used methyl bromide, was the branch manager of the corporate-owned location, and had been in the pest control business for at least a decade. He is on administrative leave. Neither employee has been charged with any crime, and neither would comment to CNN on the case.

Workers who fumigate with methyl bromide are supposed to have special training, and they’re supposed to file paperwork with the EPA, detailing how they plan to apply it, every time methyl bromide is purchased.

But the key section of those EPA documents was left blank in this case, according to the family’s attorney. The EPA says the forms stay with the distributor, who reports back to the EPA on how much methyl bromide has been sold on a quarterly basis. The EPA says this particular distributor “was not to our knowledge collecting applicator certifications and certainly was not reporting to EPA as a distributor.” The distributor has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment.

The EPA, Terminix, and the local Department of Planning and Natural Resources all declined to specifically respond to that allegation, citing an ongoing investigation.

A pattern of problems

In the U.S. Virgin Islands, allegations of lax oversight by the Department of Planning and Natural Resources surfaced long before the Esmond family fell ill. The DPNR is the local environmental agency, which receives funding from and is regulated by the EPA.

The DPNR has been riddled with corruption for years, and the EPA inspector general recently found deficiencies with the department related to management and oversight in several areas.

In May of 2014, the EPA designated it “high risk,” saying the agency “does not meet management standards.”

In addition, nearly $100,000 in federal funding that the DPNR received to train local pest control workers did not go toward training. That meant there were no classes whatsoever on the island of St. Thomas, where Terminix is based, according to the former director of the USVI Pesticide Safety Education Program, Joe Williamson.

Pesticide's dangerous history The EPA has long known of the toxic effects of methyl bromide, and in 2005 banned it except for certain agricultural applications; before the ban took effect, there were several serious incidents involving Terminix.

A Pennsylvania woman sued, alleging her 57-year-old son was killed after Terminix fumigated his Lancaster, Pennsylvania, apartment in April 2004. Court papers from the case show that Terminix said it lost the paperwork recording which chemicals were used. Terminix fought the case, saying his death was unrelated, that he had a pre-existing condition, and that no methyl bromide was used. The case settled in 2008. Also in 2006, Terminix pleaded guilty to a criminal assault charge after nine employees in New Jersey were overcome by methyl bromide fumes. The attorney general said Terminix was negligent for not giving the workers proper protective gear or training for removing tarps from stacks of cocoa bean pallets that had been fumigated. Terminix had to pay a $300,000 criminal fine, on top of a $80,000 civil fine.

Pesticide applicators are supposed to be retrained every year in order to keep their certification. But because there were no available classes on the island, pest control workers were being recertified without being retrained, Williamson said.

That was the case with Rivera, who applied the pesticide at Sirenusa. He was recertified in 2014 without taking additional training – though Williamson says that even if the classes had been available, Rivera would not have been trained to use methyl bromide, because it’s not supposed to be used indoors.

The EPA said it was assured by the DPNR that the funds are in the process of being allocated correctly. The EPA also said that Rivera’s certification history is under review by the DPNR.

But this is just the latest problem with the DPNR. According to the Department of Justice, three DPNR officials – a former commissioner and two directors – have been sentenced to jail terms since 2008. That year, former Commissioner Dean C. Plaskett was sentenced to nine years for receiving kickbacks in awarding local government contracts.

And in 2014, a director pleaded guilty to using his position to engage in illegal drug trafficking while he was head of environmental enforcement at DPNR. He was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison.

But Mapp, who took office as governor of the territory in January, told CNN the misuse of methyl bromide had nothing to do with governmental failures but was the result of bad decisions on the part of the pest control companies.

“It occurred because someone was cutting corners, thought they could enhance their profit margin and thought they could get away with it. And apparently in my own residence, someone had been getting away with it for quite some time,” Mapp said.

Williamson said the EPA bears responsibility as well. “EPA really needs to take the leadership on this, look at the mistakes that have happened here. And the very most important thing for them to do is to quit allowing methyl bromide and these other fumigants to be available to just about anybody with the certification card,” Williamson said. EPA officials tell CNN that they are working on proposals to strengthen training requirements and certifications for people who use methyl bromide.

What’s changed

Since this incident, the EPA and Terminix have done national inventories, checking for improper methyl bromide use, sources said.

The EPA also had a meeting with every region in the nation about the case and sent out a safety alert to all states and territories, asking for “increased vigilance of distribution and use of methyl bromide to ensure the product is not being applied in residential settings.”

In a statement, Terminix said: “All of us continue have this family in our thoughts and prayers. We are cooperating with the authorities and conducting our own thorough investigation.”

The company also said it has taken steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again, including halting fumigation in the U.S. Virgin Islands, reinforcing policies with employees and speaking to technicians about the specific products they use and how they’re applied.",2015-09-10 00:00:00
It’s not over: Veterans waiting months for appointments,"Story highlights Document shows veterans at VA's largest hospital facing months-long waits for appointments Last month, VA official said average wait time was four days Sources say not much has changed despite reaction after last year's VA scandal

(CNN) —

Thousands of veterans who are patients at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System have been waiting months just for an appointment, CNN has learned.

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

What’s more, administrators in charge of the massive VA facility in greater Los Angeles may have been hiding wait times, and may have misled Congress on the delays and exactly how long veterans are being forced to wait for care, according to new information obtained by CNN.

This revelation means that the scandal over delays in care and wait times for veterans, which embroiled the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs last year and even led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, is apparently not over. And the changes promised by the VA and the Obama administration may not be working.

The detailed new evidence comes from the Los Angeles VA’s own internal documents obtained by CNN, and numerous medical and administrative sources confirmed the information.

It is particularly significant as the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Medical Center is the nation’s largest VA health care system, caring for hundreds of thousands of U.S. veterans.

The VA documents show more than 12,700 appointments, which the VA calls consults, had been waiting more than 90 days to be addressed, as of mid-January.

Even new patients seeking care at the Los Angeles VA for the first time can wait months to see a doctor there.

Records show on January 15, more than 1,600 veterans who were new patients were waiting 60 to 90 days for appointments. Another 400 veterans have waited up to six months, and 64 veterans had been waiting six months to a year for their appointments.

The documents provided to CNN show the lengthy wait times are still happening, within the last several months, and sources say the backlog is happening even now.

And yet last month, the VA’s acting director for the Western region overseeing the Los Angeles VA told Congress that veterans who are new patients there only have to wait a few days for appointments.

“The average wait time for a new patient right now is about four days,” Dr. Skye McDougall, the acting director of the Desert Pacific Healthcare Network, Veterans Health Administration, testified before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.

But McDougall’s statement is simply not true.

According to the Los Angeles VA’s documents dated January 15, the actual average wait time for new patients at the VA was 48 days. A half-dozen medical and administrative sources inside the LA VA system corroborate these waits.

The wait times since then have not changed significantly – coming down slightly to a wait time of 44 days for new patients as of March 1, according to another VA document – and are still roughly 10 times what McDougall testified they were.

The delays in appointments are even taking place at Los Angeles clinics for mental health, where documents show more than 300 veterans have been waiting more than 30, 60, even 90 days for treatment.

At the congressional hearing, McDougall was specifically asked about mental health wait times for new patients, a growing national concern as hundreds of veterans are committing suicide every year.

The uncounted: War’s true toll

Asked how long the wait time is for mental health at the Los Angeles VA, McDougall testified that the same number – a four days’ wait for new patients – applies for mental health.

But that is also not true, according to the documents and sources inside the VA who spoke with CNN.

A new LA VA chart shows as of March 1, new mental health patients in Los Angeles are waiting an average 36 days just to get an appointment.

Los Angeles VA officials would not talk to CNN about the discrepancies but instead sent a statement saying that the “Greater Los Angeles and VA nationwide continues to work very hard to get Veterans off waiting lists and into clinics to get the care they have earned and deserve.”

The VA sent CNN new “retrospective data” showing primary care average wait times of four days, specialty care wait times of 7.5 days, and mental health wait times of 2.5 days, as of January. The VA explained that the chart for new patients obtained by CNN “does not include same day appointments or in some cases same week appointments for those Veterans who need care quickly….”

New patients, the VA told CNN, “typically account for less than 10% of all Veteran appointments and are not representative of the whole patient population.”

Despite the “retrospective data,” the real truth, say the sources CNN has interviewed, is reflected in the internal LA VA documents obtained by CNN – that wait times for many patients at the Los Angeles VA Medical Centers extends into weeks and months and are a serious problem.

This news of continuing delays in Los Angeles comes a year after reports of cover-ups and turmoil at the VA, which became a national scandal, where wait times, veterans’ deaths and even secret waiting lists were revealed at VA hospitals across the country.

Congress even passed a new law last fall to help veterans get care more quickly, as a direct result of the scandal. And since the scandal, Congress has approved $16 billion extra for the VA in an attempt to hire more doctors and nurses and to build more facilities. The VA removed its 14-day scheduling goal to discourage engaging in “inappropriate scheduling practices,” and President Barack Obama also appointed a new VA secretary, Robert McDonald, last summer.

Story highlights IRS scam has swindled victims out of more than $15 million since 2013 Scammers warn of seizing property, prison time FTC and Treasury department have open investigations

(CNN) —

They are very convincing when they call. They have a Washington phone number and can cite your financial history down to the cent.

They say you’re under investigation, in danger of losing your home, or worse, your freedom – unless you pay thousands of dollars on the spot.

But they’re not real. And you’re not in trouble. Not unless you take it seriously. This is a scam.

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

A big one. Federal authorities say it’s the largest IRS impersonation scam they’ve ever seen – swindling victims out of more than $15 million since it began in 2013.

“They have information that only the Internal Revenue Service would know about you,” said Timothy Camus, deputy inspector general for investigations with the Treasury Department. “It’s a byproduct of today’s society. There’s so much information available on individuals.”

Using identity theft technology, the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3,000 people in the past two years, although the Treasury Department cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher. Camus said they’ve recorded more than 366,000 reports of contact with the scammers, and it’s increasing at a rate of 10,000 to 12,000 a week.

Authorities believe the thieves are operating out of India, using phishing technology to make it appear they’re IRS agents in Washington.

The Federal Trade Commission, which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint, and the Treasury Department, which leads the criminal probe, both have open investigations.

The largest loss reported was a staggering $500,000, Camus said. Most have lost about $5,000.

One of those victims was former NFL player Frank Garcia, who is now a sports radio host in Charlotte, North Carolina. When he got the call, it sounded so authentic, he left the radio station in a panic, scramming to get the money they wanted.

12 scams to avoid

“The only thing running through my head is, I’m going to jail. I’m gonna be on television, in handcuffs, for tax evasion,” he recalled. “I had to follow specific steps not to be arrested. That the authorities had been contacted and in fact, they are on the way and will be there in 30 minutes.”

Garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around Charlotte, depositing $500 each time into a PayPal account set up by the woman on the phone. He ended up losing about $4,000.

He, and other victims, told CNN the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone.

“I have never been arrested in my life and was very scared,” said Kin Ko, a New Jersey resident who lost about $5,000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison, and the IRS was about to confiscate his assets: His car, his house and all the money in his bank account. The person had a badge number, read him an arrest warrant from a nearby police jurisdiction.

The thieves are incredibly smart and convincing. They harness stolen identities and use programs such as Google Earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money.

“It sounded as legitimate as could be,” said Al Cadenhead, a pastor in North Carolina who also fell victim. “They knew where I was. He told me where to go – to the Rite Aid, up two streets turn left to the Rite Aid. The names of the streets, it was really just incredible.”

Cadenhead told CNN he didn’t come to his senses until he’d signed over $16,000.

Identity theft tops list of consumer complaints

“It was like I came out of a coma and realized this was not normal and this is not how you do business,” he said. “I know other people who’ve heard the story say ‘How did a guy with a Ph.D. fall victim?’ I was the perfect victim. I’ve never been audited, never paid a traffic ticket. I don’t know how to pay fines. How do I know they aren’t stern and serious about everything?”

Camus said many people are afraid when they hear from the IRS, so they do whatever the caller says.

In December, federal authorities found and arrested two U.S.-based “runners” who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from pre-paid cards to foreign bank accounts.

In many cases, victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations. Ko said that it was a bank teller who told him this was a scam when the impersonator asked him to go through a second round of depositing money.

For Frank Garcia, the light came on when the woman on the phone asked him for another $8,000 after he thought his debt had been paid.

He says he decided to hang up and await what the woman promised would be an arrest – which, of course, never came.

“I felt taken advantage of. I felt small. And I was naive,” he said. “I wasn’t aware. I didn’t understand the system. And didn’t blame anybody but myself for not taking more time to understand those things.”

Often, Camus says, immigrants are targeted and threatened with deportation. The elderly are also a popular target, although the scam has grown so large, people of all ages, income levels and status are getting these calls.

Treasury Department officials say if you get one of these calls, the best and simplest way to handle it is to hang up.

Camus himself, a Treasury Department investigator, even got one. He told them, “Your time is coming.”",2015-03-13 00:00:00
School fundraising letters signed by fictitious boy,"Story highlights St. Joseph's Indian School raises over $50 million annually from donations It sends waves of mailings across the country asking for help A Native American leader denounces the tactics, calling them ""poverty porn"" The school admits that the author of a begging letter does not exist

(CNN) —

The boy’s stories are heartbreaking: “My dad drinks and hits me … my mom chose drugs over me … my home on the reservation isn’t a safe place for me to be,” wrote Josh Little Bear. His request seems reasonable – send a few dollars to help St. Joseph’s Indian School to keep “kids like me safe … so we don’t have to live this way anymore.”

The story, begging for help, is part of massive national marketing campaign involving 30 million pieces of a mail a year. And it’s a successful one, raising more than $50 million last year.

But Josh Little Bear doesn’t exist. It’s not just a pseudonym to protect a child. The story is a fabrication, a compiling of events that may or may not have happened to paint a broad picture that Native American leaders say does not exist.

David Ruff/CNN Flags fly at the entrance to St. Joseph's Indian School.

Officials at St. Joseph’s Indian School – a 200-person boarding school in Chamberlain, South Dakota, that’s affiliated with a Roman Catholic charity based in Wisconsin – say they send out waves of mailings three or four times a year.

The latest, a Christmas-oriented mailer, was sent in early November, according to the school’s director of communications.

The packets include calendars, personalized return address stickers, notepads, elaborate stickers and a so-called “Dreamcatcher,” a Native American handicraft that by tradition gives its owners good dreams.

The Christmas appeal introduced “Emily High Elk.” A year ago when her family brought her to the school, the letter says, “(y)ou could see the hopelessness she felt in her dark brown eyes.”

Now, the letter goes on, “her big bright smile reveals how her life has changed.”

David Ruff/CNN Children walk through the school after classes.

But again, “Emily High Elk,” is more than a pseudonym. The girl whose life is described in the letter does not exist.

According to its financial statements, St. Joseph’s Indian School raised more than $51 million last year from millions of Americans who donated because of those mailings.

CNN began receiving complaints about mailings like this more than two years ago. When asked about Josh Little Bear’s letter, Kory Christianson, the director of development, wrote us that there was no such student.

“The name ‘Josh Little Bear’ is fictitious,” he wrote, “but unfortunately, his story is not.”

The letter, he added, “is a true story of the very real and challenging situations that far too many children face not only in the Native American community, but in families found in every sphere of society.” He said it wasn’t the “intention to disparage in any way the Native American community.”

But some Native Americans say there is deliberate disparagement and that it’s a marketing technique. A half-hour drive away from St. Joseph’s is the Crow Creek Lakota Sioux reservation in central South Dakota, where its vice chairman, Leonard Pease, scoffed at the fundraising letter.

“That’s how they get their money,” he told CNN. “To me, they make the Indians look bad.”

Michael Roberts, president of the First Nations Development Institute that aims to strengthen and support Native communities, went further. He termed the fundraising letter and the admission that the child is nonexistent as “poverty porn.”

“They are raising money in the name of Indians, using the worst of poverty porn of all Indian country to raise money on all our social ills,” said Roberts, whose Colorado-based group represents six Native American nonprofit organizations.

It seems that the money being raised is being used for the right reasons, as far as CNN could see. We were given a tour of the school but were not allowed to film. The complex, on the banks of the Missouri River, looks like a nice place and the children seemed happy, well-fed and well-housed.

We tried unsuccessfully to interview the leadership of St. Joseph’s. The communications director, Jona Ohm, first invited us to meet the school president at the small museum operated by the school.

The president, Mike Tyrell, acknowledged that the mailings “push the edge” of marketing and asking about them “is a legitimate question.” But Ohm told us to stop.

“You don’t have permission to record in any way, shape or form,” she said.

According to its own financial statement for 2013, St. Joseph’s has abundant assets. Cash on hand was listed at more than $122 million in June 2013, an increase of more than $18.5 million over the previous year.",2014-11-17 00:00:00
Politicians live it up and have the lobbyists pay,"Story highlights The lush side of lobbying is on display at luxury resorts Congressmen and senators host weekend retreats to taste wine, fish, play golf Lobbyists accept the exclusive invitations -- and then make political donations They say there's no better access to politicians and their staffs

(CNN) —

On any given weekend, lobbyists in Washington head for the airport to jet off to luxurious locations across the country.

Destinations include Napa Valley in California for wine tasting, Wyoming for fly fishing and any number of spas, golf courses, even exclusive hunting trips.

They are invited to these weekend retreats by members of Congress and their political action committees.

The cost of accepting the invite is a political donation of anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000. And that doesn’t include the cost of travel and lodging at some of the most posh resorts in the United States.

Drew Griffin/CNN Rep. Duncan Hunter hosted a cocktail party as the sun set over the Pacific.

Why go? Lobbyists tell CNN there is no better access to a member of Congress and his or her top staff than spending a relaxing weekend with them, away from Capitol Hill.

It used to be that lobbyists would take politicians on trips, but when rules were changed and that was outlawed, politicians and their fund-raisers came up with this variation – organize the trips and invite the lobbyists along to pay for them.

This past August, CNN followed U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, to a lush weekend retreat at the Montage Laguna Beach resort. The weekend was capped off by a seaside cocktail party hosted by the congressman as the sun set over the Pacific.

In early September, U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, hosted a golf weekend at the Inn at Perry Cabin, a posh resort on the banks of Chesapeake Bay. A Friday night terrace cocktail party included a special appearance by fellow Maryland lawmaker U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, who was one of the first on the links the next morning.

Both Cardin and Hunter declined interview requests.

Hunter’s aide told us: “The congressman holds events of all types in many different venues and either people choose to support him or they don’t, simple as that.”

Drew Griffin/CNN Sen. Ben Cardin welcomed paying guests to the Inn at Perry Cabin, overlooking Chesapeake Bay.

Cardin’s communications director, Sue Walitsky, sent an email explaining that the fund-raiser at the Inn at Perry Cabin was for the senator’s leadership PAC, “so none of the funds raised went to support his personal campaign.”

She went on to say the weekend also provided the senator “an opportunity to show off one of the many beautiful locations in his home state.”

Sandra Langlois says an influx of illegal immigrants has made it harder to find work in Albertville, Alabama. ""It's unfair,"" she says. More than a quarter of this town's residents are Hispanic, and they have different views about the impact immigration has on the community.

Sandra Langlois says an influx of illegal immigrants has made it harder to find work in Albertville, Alabama. ""It's unfair,"" she says. More than a quarter of this town's residents are Hispanic, and they have different views about the impact immigration has on the community.

Albertville, Alabama (CNN) -- There's one question Sandra Langlois is sick of hearing in job interviews.

""Do you speak Spanish?""

Langlois doesn't -- and doesn't think she should have to.

At 42, she already speaks two languages. Born in Germany, she moved to Pennsylvania as a child and learned to speak English fluently. She thought that would be enough to get a job in the United States.

Now, as she waits for an interview at the Albertville unemployment office, she's not sure it will be.

Hispanic immigrants, she says, have transformed the state she's called home for decades. And the ones who came to the United States illegally, she says, make a tough job market even tougher.

Langlois needs to find work, and fast: Her family is living in a motel after the power company turned out the lights in their trailer. She's sharing a car and cell phone with her father-in-law.

The Spanish question, she says, has abruptly ended more than one interview. She hopes it won't throw her out of the running this time, too.

""It's kind of, really, discrimination,"" she says. ""If you're not here legally, then you need to go ahead and go back home. ... They need to come over here the right way. Don't sneak over. Don't stay here.""

It's a sentiment that runs deep through some circles of this largely white, working-class town, which made headlines as the epicenter of Alabama's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. Five years later, people in Albertville are still split over the changes they've seen -- and what they think should happen next.

So is the country.

Working-class whites -- a group some analysts say could play a decisive role in the presidential election -- are far more likely than others to say immigrants who arrived illegally should be deported. More than half (55%) say that's something the government should attempt, compared with 27% of white college grads.

Those statistics don't surprise Glenda Barnes. The 70-year-old Albertville resident says she moved out of her neighborhood when immigrants started moving in. Her street started to go downhill, she says, as people crammed cars onto lawns and stopped taking care of homes.

""If you lived here, you'd understand,"" she says. ""Our town was so neat, a nice little town. Now it's like we don't care, and everything's falling in.""

Rachel Zavaleta isn't surprised by the numbers either. The 29-year-old still remembers what people shouted at her on the playground when she came to Albertville with her family nearly 20 years ago: Go back to Mexico.

Albertville bills itself as ""the Fire Hydrant Capital of the World,"" but it's better known for its poultry processing plants.

A changing landscape

Debates about deporting immigrants who came here illegally aren't just political talking points in Albertville; they're personal.

This is a city where officials tried hard to force them out, in a state where lawmakers passed the toughest law in the country aimed at doing the same thing.

Five years later, even people who don't see eye to eye on immigration can agree on one thing: It didn't work.

Albertville proudly bills itself as ""the Fire Hydrant Capital of the World,"" for the Mueller factory that's manufactured millions there. But across the state, it's better known for another industry: poultry processing plants, which employ thousands of workers -- many of them immigrants.

More than a quarter of the town's roughly 22,000 residents are Hispanic. And Alabama's 2011 immigration law scared many people who'd found jobs in the area.

Terrified they'd be rounded up and deported, they abandoned homes, pulled their kids out of school and moved to other states. Neighborhoods were left nearly empty. Shopping districts became ghost towns.

But in 2012, a federal appeals court gutted much of the law , ruling that parts of it were unconstitutional, including a requirement that public schools determine the immigration status of students and parents.

Now, Albertville's Latino immigrant population is thriving once again. A growing number of Haitian refugees, recruited by chicken plants in recent years, have moved to the city, too.

The large Catholic church where thousands pray in Spanish every Sunday just paid off its new $1.2 million building, thanks to donations from the congregation.

Eateries serving tacos and tamales are easier to find in some parts of the city than restaurants offering grits or fried catfish.

The relationships between residents -- and the approaches local leaders take -- have changed.

But it doesn't take long to see that tensions are still simmering.

Stop by the basketball court where Mexican workers are shooting hoops, and you'll hear how afraid they are that Donald Trump might be president , and what it was like a few years back when people couldn't get water or electricity in their homes unless they could prove they were here legally.

Sit for a moment in the Little League stands nearby, and a woman flipping through a coupon book as she leans back in a lawn chair will tell you how immigrants should stop speaking Spanish and sucking benefits from the system.

Step into a shopping mall off the busy four-lane highway through town, and you'll see immigrants searching for the right words in an English class as they talk with their teacher about what foods to eat on American holidays and how fast the cashiers speak at Walmart.

Cross the parking lot to visit the unemployment office, and you'll hear some people say the influx of immigrants gave the region's economy a boost, while others grumble it cost them their jobs.

""I think they should have to learn to speak like we do,"" says a woman who didn't want to be identified.

'There's plenty of jobs'

Langlois runs her fingers through her hair as she scans the bulletin board at the unemployment office, looking for a lead.

Could she be a dishwasher or a welder? Will she go back to working at a chicken plant? Is there any other choice?

As an immigrant herself, Langlois says she's had to follow strict rules and make sure her documents are in order when she applies for jobs. And she resents immigrants who came to the United States illegally for finding ways to skirt the system.

""It's just not fair,"" she says. ""It's like they're getting special treatment.""

The CNN/KFF poll found that working-class whites were significantly more likely than other groups to say illegal immigration had directly affected them.

More than a quarter (27%) say their family has been negatively affected by undocumented immigrants taking jobs in their community, and among this group, 8 in 10 want the government to deport all undocumented immigrants.

The trend is even stronger in the South.

Working-class whites in this part of the United States are about twice as likely as those in other regions to say they've been affected (40% vs. 18% to 22% in other regions).

One possible explanation: The South is where demographers say they've seen the greatest growth in foreign-born and Hispanic populations in recent years.

But not everyone thinks immigration in the area hurts a shot at getting a job.

""There's plenty of jobs. You've just got to want to do it,"" Ronnie Wise says as he waits for an interview after filling out an application at the unemployment office. ""A lot of people don't want to, and they (immigrants) will. If it weren't for them, we wouldn't have any chicken plants here.""

If he meets immigrants who need work, Wise says he knows just what he'll do.

Help them.

Belt buckles inside a display case at an Albertville gift shop show the city's changing demographics.

'There are so many of us'

Two belt buckles sit side by side in a glass display case at a gift shop on Main Street. One is a Confederate battle flag. The other says ""Hecho en Mexico"" -- Made in Mexico.

A Mexican family searches for shoes in the back of the store. An American woman circles the store and ends up at the cash register with an ashtray and a bottle of perfume called Love.

As she works the front counter at the Gift on Main/El Regalo, Rachel Zavaleta says it's great to see customers from different backgrounds shopping at the store.

Times have changed, she says, since the city and state tried to push out immigrants.

""Sometimes, you still get a dirty look when you go somewhere. But they don't do it as much, probably because they'd have to be giving dirty looks all day, since there are so many of us,"" she says.

But Trump's campaign is already rekindling friction, she says, in an area where he is heavily favored to win.

""You hear people talk, even your friends or people you know, about getting rid of immigrants. They're telling that to us, not realizing that we're Hispanic,"" she says. ""It doesn't click in their heads how it would be affecting us.""

A Hispanic mayor?

Fox News anchors rattle off headlines on TV as Joe Lusk gets ready to dig into his breakfast. After a waitress places his plate on the table, he bows his head in prayer.

The 59-year-old fence company owner is a lifelong Albertville resident. And he often stops to eat at this family-run restaurant, where a sign hanging by the front door pays tribute to ""Southern living, where the tea is sweet, our words are long, the days are warm and our faith is strong.""

Lately, he says, the topic of immigration has been coming up more often at the breakfast table.

Lusk sees the growing presence of immigrants in Albertville as a clash of cultures that's gradually gotten worse.

""There's no place,"" he says, ""to really be away from them anymore.""

There's no doubt that most immigrants work hard and mean well, he says.

But Lusk sees immigrants as a burden. So do nearly half (47%) of the white, working-class people polled, compared with 20% of white college grads.

He says immigrants are draining the school and health care systems, and that some of them have brought crime to the city.

Those who came illegally should be sent back, he says, but they probably never will be -- given how much of a financial interest many companies have in keeping them around.

""If they legalize,"" he says, ""we'll probably have a Hispanic mayor in 10 years.""

The Albertville Museum displays major moments in the city's history, but so far the exhibits haven't mentioned immigration.

'Let's move forward'

Just a few blocks from the center of Albertville, a historical marker in front of the city's museum talks about migration. But it's referring to people who moved to this mountain town from Georgia and Tennessee in the 1800s.

It wasn't until about 30 years ago, museum board member Danny Maltbie says, that immigrants from other countries started trickling in.

Maltbie spends a lot of time digging up information about Albertville's history. Visit the retired automotive plant electrician while he's volunteering at the museum and he'll tell you about devastating tornadoes that ripped off roofs and forced the city to rebuild -- twice.

He'll tell you that the railroad rumbling through town changed everything, bringing fertilizer for the first time and giving farmers the chance to grow crops in the tough mountain soil. He'll tell you that the arrival of the chicken plants decades ago boosted the economy and eventually brought thousands of immigrants here.

And he'll tell you how happy he was to give a recent tour of the town cemetery to a class of high school students learning to speak English.

""I thought that was a very good thing that those kids came to see our museum and learn about our history,"" he says.

Now, he says, it's their history, too.

""They're here,"" he says. ""Let's accept them. Let's move forward.""

Local legend has it that signs near the US-Mexico border once informed immigrants that jobs were waiting for them in Albertville. Whether that's how they ended up here, there's no doubt they left their mark on the city once they arrived.

The museum's volunteer board has debated how to deal with the influx. Inside the one-room museum, there are displays about the town's founder, its Main Street and its small African-American population. But immigration is a topic that hasn't yet been touched on the museum's walls.

It's a sensitive issue, museum board member Glenda Wooten says, and they're still trying to sort out the right wording.

This month, volunteers added a new entry to the official timeline they hand out to visitors:

""1992: First Hispanics moved to Albertville from Mexico to work in the chicken plants. The children were enrolled in the school system, speaking no English and local administrators and teachers did not speak Spanish. Soon, Albertville City Schools' enrollment for Mexicans/Hispanic students was one of the largest in the state.""

About 40% of students at Albertville High School are Hispanic. The principal says diversity prepares kids for the real world.

'Diversity is a strength'

About 40% of Albertville High School's more than 1,300 students are Hispanic, Principal Deidra Robinson says.

Students from different backgrounds didn't used to mingle much, she says, but now they stand shoulder to shoulder on the football field and sit together in the cafeteria.

""They just grew up together,"" she says.

And even when tension in the community has boiled over, she says, officials worked hard to keep it out of the schools.

""We don't let immigration or the diversity of our school be a barrier to our success,"" she says. ""We see it as part of our success. ... It's helping prepare our students for the real world.""

A majority (60%) of working-class whites in the CNN/KFF poll say increasing diversity is enriching American culture. But 33% view diversity as a threat, and 38% say increasing diversity is harmful because ""some people feel like they no longer belong.""

Robinson says teachers in Albertville make sure everyone has a place.

The school system has programs dedicated to helping newcomers who are still learning English, she says, and most immigrants who need the classes are quick learners.

There's one figure Robinson says she frequently mentions to skeptical parents and community members as she fights the misconception that large amounts of school resources are being spent on immigrants.

Only about 10% of her students are still learning English, she says.

""When somebody asks a question, they try to make it about color. I just go to turning it around. ... Most of them are actually proficient in both languages,"" she says. ""That's a comfort to some people.""

'I believe in the rule of law'

Chuck Ellis thinks of the way his 11-year-old daughter, Marli, wakes up in the morning.

She's full of joy when she gets out of bed, he says, knowing things will turn out OK no matter what happens during her school day. But Ellis knows dangers could be lurking.

That fear takes hold every time he thinks of the man Marli is named for: his brother-in-law, Marlin Strange, who was shot dead 17 years ago. A Mexican immigrant charged in the slaying is on the FBI's list of most wanted fugitives.

Illegal immigration, Ellis says, brought more drugs, crime and prostitution to Albertville. Houses were overrun, with people cramming into buildings and sleeping in shifts.

""It became crazy how many problems we ran into,"" says Ellis, a state trooper who was on the Albertville City Council from 2008 to 2012.

""I'm not racist,"" Ellis says. ""I believe in the rule of law.""

While in office, Ellis made fighting illegal immigration a priority. Public safety, he says, was his aim.

It's a concern for many Americans when they talk about immigration. About half (49%) of white working-class Americans think Latin American immigrants increase crime in communities, according to the CNN/KFF poll. That's higher than other groups polled; among white college grads the number is 32%.

Along with the city's then-mayor, Ellis supported ordinances that made English the official language, booted taco trucks from operating on Main Street, limited the number of people who could live inside a home and ordered store signs to include English translations.

And he invited someone to Albertville to help the city take more substantive measures: Kris Kobach, a prominent conservative attorney who made a name for himself helping governments across the country craft laws to crack down on illegal immigration.

In the end, the city decided not to hire Kobach. But Alabama legislators did; he was one of the primary architects of the state's immigration law. And Ellis is proud of inviting him to Albertville. He still has a copy of a newspaper front page that shows him shaking Kobach's hand.

Ellis isn't on the City Council anymore; he lost his bid for re-election in 2012. But he's considering another run for county sheriff (he lost his bid to unseat the incumbent in 2014). Rounding up millions of immigrants who entered the United States illegally and deporting them isn't feasible, he says. But more needs to be known about who's already here.

""The big thing is the vetting process, making sure that people have done the right things, that people don't have illnesses, that people aren't bad people,"" he says, ""because we've got enough bad people in the country without letting in more.""

Freddy and Nancy Salazar relax at home with son Aydan, 2. ""There is no racism between children,"" Freddy Salazar says.

'I'm not stealing anyone's job'

Nancy Salazar says she'll never shake how it felt to live in Albertville when city and state leaders took aim at illegal immigration. Even though she was born in the United States, Salazar says she felt the glaring heat of racism then. And sometimes, she still does.

Hard-working immigrants are the bedrock of Albertville's economy, she says, and it's unfair to blame them for crime in the city or anywhere else.

""We are not what they think,"" she says. ""They are just outraged Hispanics have something.""

In English, Salazar speaks with the smooth lilt of a Southern belle. And in Spanish, her words slice through the air with the sharp precision of a native speaker.

The 30-year-old preschool teacher, who was born in Florida to parents who immigrated to the United States from Mexico, sees the importance of keeping traditions alive.

On the wall of her living room, her high school senior picture shows her wearing the silver dangly earrings she'd put on for cheerleading practice; she's still embarrassed she forgot to wear pearls that day.

Nearby, she keeps a large Virgin of Guadalupe figure standing next to a big-screen TV.

Her husband, Freddy, who was born in Mexico, says he's worked hard in difficult conditions to become a supervisor at a nearby poultry plant. His fingers are so swollen from his years on the job that he struggled to get a ring on his finger when the couple recently renewed their marriage vows.

""The racists are the ones who don't know the work that we do. They judge without knowing. ... There's never going to be an American doing the work I do. I'm not stealing anyone's job,"" he says. ""There simply is work.""

Fruits and veggies are plentiful at the Albertville Farmers Market. One vendor says immigrants work hard harvesting crops.

'An invaluable resource'

Monte Weldon walks over to a giant Scrabble board on the ground just a few steps from her stall at the Albertville Farmers Market and spells out T-O-M-A-T-O.

It's one of many crops Americans wouldn't have a chance to enjoy, she says, without immigrant labor.

""They get a bad rap, but you know what, a lot of people would go hungry if they weren't there,"" she says. ""They're an invaluable resource.""

As she sells tomatoes, okra and black-eyed peas, Weldon says she usually tries to steer clear of arguments over immigration. It's one of those issues where people never seem willing to listen or change their minds.

Instead, she focuses on her children.

""I taught my kids to understand about different people, different ways to believe. I raised my children in church,"" she said. ""We're not God. It's not our place to judge.""

The color of your skin doesn't matter, she says, and everyone's blood is red.

'We're a community'

""How are we all going to live together here?""

That's the question the exasperated publisher of a local newspaper asked back in 2009 at a town meeting as residents and local leaders sparred over immigration.

Back then, it seemed like the fury might never die down.

Now, while national debate over immigration rages, many in this city have settled for a reluctant truce. Some hope they'll have another shot at getting their way. And others wonder if they're experiencing the uneasy calm that comes before a storm they won't be able to stop.

Lindsey Lyons led Albertville's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and trumpeted the state's law on national media. As mayor, he kept a US Border Patrol baseball cap on display in his City Hall office.

Lyons, who lost his post in 2012, declined to comment for this story. When he spoke with CNN in 2011 , he said he had run for office because he was tired of the DUIs, drug trafficking and gang activity that he saw immigrants bringing to Albertville.

""We have a right and moral responsibility,"" he said, ""to protect our citizens and our quality of life.""

Tracy Honea, who ousted Lyons and just won re-election, says when it comes to immigration, he's doing his best to play the hand he was dealt.

""I truly believe folks need to be legal,"" he says, ""but it's out of our control on a national level.""

Honea says he tries to take a positive approach as mayor.

""We've worked really hard at trying to create an atmosphere that we're a community, and it's a growing community,"" he says.

On his office wall, Honea keeps a framed photo of Ronald Reagan riding a white horse that he was thrilled to win at a silent auction. Beneath the photo is a quote from the former US President's 1985 State of the Union address:

""Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right of all God's children.""

Earlier this year, a class of high school students learning English visited City Hall.

Honea fielded questions from them inside the City Council's chambers. And in a class photo outside, he stood behind them, smiling.",2016-09-22 00:00:00

(CNN) —

On the surface, Ann Bryant and Jennifer Gibson could not be more alike.

Both are white women without college degrees. Both live in North Carolina. Both think America’s best days are ahead of it.

But their shared optimism stems from sharply different assessments of the country’s current state of affairs. Bryant, a retired nurse who says she lives comfortably in New Bern, North Carolina, sees an improving economy, neighbors whose children are purchasing their first homes and general prosperity. She also says she will probably vote for Hillary Clinton.

“I see improvement in people’s wages,” said Bryant, who declined to give her age except to say that she is a senior citizen.

“The way they dress. When I go to the grocery store, I see people with big baskets of food. People look like they’re doing well. I just think that things are better all the way around.”

For her part, Gibson, 63, sees a country overrun by immigrants and refugees with alien values, living on the dole, taking jobs and benefits away from native-born Americans.

She says political leaders in Washington are out of touch with the concerns of people like her and that her optimism for the future is based on her belief that Donald Trump will win the presidency.

“Right now everything is in one hell of a mess, and I believe that Trump is going to come in and clean things up,” she said.

Far from a monolith

The white working class, which forms the core of Trump’s support, is often treated as a monolithic entity, both in its beliefs and its images. But an extensive survey of whites with less than a four-year college degree conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation paints a picture of an often-ignored demographic that belies the stereotypic images of Midwestern steel workers toting lunch pails to work, or golden-hearted cashiers working at Walmart or laid-off coal miners in Appalachia sitting around, chugging beer and seething in resentment.

What the poll discovered is that, as much as the white working class differs in attitudes and experience from college-educated whites and from working-class blacks and Hispanics, it presents an intriguing mosaic within its demographic group.

Far from being monolithic, the white working class has sharp divisions based on age, geography, income, gender and religion. These differences show up in their views towards immigration and racial and ethnic diversity; optimism about the direction of their lives and their children’s future; their opinion about government or their support for Donald Trump.

“We went into this poll trying to keep an open mind and not look at the white working class as a monolithic group,” said Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

For example, urban-dwelling members of the white working class are more optimistic about America’s future than their counterparts in rural areas. Almost three-quarters of working-class whites younger than 30 who were surveyed believe increasing racial and ethnic diversity is enriching the country’s culture, while about half of those older than 65 who were surveyed do.

Southern whites who have not attended college are twice as likely as those in other regions to say they have been negatively impacted by undocumented immigrants taking jobs in their community.

Southern working-class whites are the most pessimistic about the country’s future. Only 37% of working-class whites in the South who were surveyed believe the country’s “best days are ahead of us,” compared to nearly half those in the West and 52% in the Northeast. Evangelical Christians and those living in rural areas tend to be the most downcast about the future.

About 60% of working-class whites surveyed who say they are evangelical Christians say the country’s best days are behind us, compared to 42% of Catholics, 53% of mainline Protestants and 42% who say they have no religion.

Similarly, 41% of those surveyed living in urban areas say America’s best days are behind us, while nearly 60% of those in rural areas feel that way.

Wanting more from the government

Differences also show up strongly with regard to the anger that the white working class feels toward government. The survey found 69% of those earning less than $30,000 say the federal government is not doing enough to help them and people like them. That’s more than twice the 31% of those earning $75,000 or more who feel that way.

“You can go back the last 50 years and it’s always the same,” says Tim Bequette, 56, a retired truck driver who lives on disability in Farmington, Missouri. “Politicians make all kinds of promises. But when they get elected they only pay attention to people who have money. If you’ve got money, you can get what you want. If you don’t have money, nothing happens.”

Ironically, or perhaps due to the fact that their incomes are lower, a larger percentage of people, 63%, who receive at least one government benefit, excluding Social Security and Medicare, say the government isn’t doing enough for them. That’s compared to the 47% who feel that way even though they receive no government aid.

Fully 71% of rural working-class whites blame the government for economic problems facing the working class, compared to 51% of working-class whites who live in cities. Rage at the government is felt most acutely by older white working-class men. Nearly 80% of the men over than age of 50 who were surveyed say the government bares all or most of the blame for the problems facing the white working class. About 53% of women in that age group who were polled agree.

But despite the anger expressed toward the government and the pessimism about the country’s future, majorities of working-class whites surveyed – regardless of age, income, region, religion and gender – say they are satisfied with their personal financial situation.

“I’m pretty happy overall with the place that I am,” said Amanda, 28, who lives in Overton, Texas, and only wants to be identified by her first name. “I have a low mortgage. My kids are going to good schools. My job is relatively stable.”

Chad Fritz, 42, says he is not concerned about immigrants. “Trade deals concern me more,” he says. “I’m more concerned about losing jobs than people taking jobs, which is what many people say immigrants do. But I feel the jobs they’re taking are jobs Americans don’t really want to do. I don’t want to go pick apples and oranges, and those are the type of jobs immigrants are doing.”

Fritz lives in Delaware, Ohio. He is a stay-at-home dad, taking care of his one-year-old son during the week while his wife works as a CPA in nearby Columbus. On many weekends he works as a glass blower.

The Columbus metro area is an economic powerhouse with low unemployment, rising home prices and high median incomes. Fritz acknowledges that the strength of the local economy influences his attitude.

“Columbus is a growing city,” he said. “It’s booming. It’s doing very well. There are lots of jobs. I might have a different view if I lived somewhere else.”

The politics of the white working class

While support for Trump is relatively strong across the board among working-class whites, there are significant differences among different groups.

Men over the age of 50 are among the Republican nominee’s strongest backers with 68% of voters in this group saying they would consider voting for him, compared to 51% of women who are 50 years or older.

Rural (68%), suburban (66%) and Southern (70%) working-class white voters voice support for Trump in larger numbers than urban dwellers (49%) and those living in the West (54%) and Midwest (53%). And 78% of working-class white voters surveyed who say immigrants are a burden on the country say they would consider voting for him, compared to 38% who of those who believe immigrants strengthen the country.

Amanda, of Overton, Texas, and Ann Bryant say they are supporting Clinton. Bequette and Jennifer Gibson back Trump. Chad Fritz is undecided, but doesn’t like either Trump or Clinton. He is trying to decide between Green Party nominee Jill Stein and the Libertarian candidate (Gary Johnson), whose name he couldn’t remember.

Working-class whites are clearly more hostile to immigration and the nation’s increasing racial and ethnic diversity.

Respondents were asked which comes closer to their view: that immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents, or immigrants are a burden on the country because they take our jobs, housing and health care. Nearly half (47%) of those surveyed say it’s the latter.

More than half (55%) say they think the government should try to deport all people living in the country illegally.

Also, compared to college-educated whites or black or Hispanic working-class people, working-class whites are more likely to say immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks or that recent immigrants from Latin America take jobs away from Americans or add to the crime problem.

“Obama agreed to let all them refugees come in and give them a place to live,” said Bequette, the retired truck driver. “Yet you see hundreds of thousands of Vietnam vets living on the streets. The politicians are more worried about being politically correct and about what other countries think about us than they do Americans.”

But that hostility is not shared equally across the board.

Sixty-one percent of rural white working-class surveyed say the government should try to deport all those in the country illegally, compared to 49% of urban dwellers.

Moreover, compared to other religions, evangelical Christians are more likely to say that increasing diversity is threatening, rather than enriching American culture; believe that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorism, add to the crime problem, and take jobs away from Americans; and are less likely to say that these immigrants are “basically good, honest people.”

“Half the people coming in are young men,” Gibson, who describes herself as Pentecostal, says of Muslim refugees. “I feel sorry for the women and children. We need to make a place for them over there. The guys? I don’t feel sorry for them at all. They need to turn their asses around and pick up a gun and fight for their country. Our guys are fighting for their country. They should too, instead of running over here.”

Fritz, who says he has no problems with immigrants, says he was raised Catholic but hasn’t been to church in 20 years. “I’m not a church-type person,” he says. “But, from a sense of morals, I like to think I have Christian values.”",2016-09-25 00:00:00

Story highlights About 6 in 10 white working class people say it's gotten harder for people like them to get ahead For nearly all of American history, whites without college degrees made up a majority of voters

(CNN) —

The biggest story of the 2016 election is undoubtedly the rise of Donald Trump, and behind the Republican nominee is a group in its last throes as the biggest force in politics: The white working class.

A new survey from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation delves deeply into this pivotal group, to understand their experience in an America whose changing demographics and economy have arguably impacted this group more than almost any other.

Contrary to many assumptions about this group, the poll finds working class whites generally happy with their lives, and mostly satisfied with their personal financial situation. Just 18% say they are angry about the way things are going in their own lives, and 44% think America’s best days lie ahead. They are just as likely as their black and Hispanic working class counterparts to feel optimistic about their lives, 7 in 10 or more say so in each group.

But the white working class harbors deep concerns about the country’s economy, the amount the government is doing to help the working class and their own ability to influence politics.

A majority, 53%, say they are very dissatisfied with the country’s economic situation and 84% say their views are not well represented by the government in Washington, well above the share of white college graduates or black or Hispanic working class to say the same.

About 6 in 10 white working class people say it’s gotten harder for people like them to get ahead financially and two-thirds say it’s harder to find good jobs. Many are concerned about what the next generation will face: 50% say they expect their children to have a lower standard of living than they currently have, compared with 35% among whites who have college degrees, 43% among the black working class and 31% among the Hispanic working class.

More than other groups, whites without college degrees blame the government for the economic problems that beset the working class, with 62% saying the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for those problems compared with less than half among whites with degrees and the black and Hispanic working class, and 66% saying it doesn’t do enough to help the working class.

Amid these concerns, Trump holds broad appeal among white working class voters. Sixty percent say they would consider Trump this fall, about double the 29% who say they’d consider Hillary Clinton. Among other groups, far fewer even say they would consider Trump. Among whites with college degrees, 39% say they’d consider him – that’s cut in half among Hispanic working class voters, 18% of whom say they’d consider Trump, and just 3% of black working class voters say they’ll give Trump a look.

White working class voters are more Republican than Democratic, 56% in the CNN/KFF poll are Republicans or independents who lean that way, compared with 33% who consider themselves Democrats or are independents who lean that way, but the poll reveals that their views on what the government does to help people like them and the changing demographics of the country – two issues that have been a central focus of Trump’s campaign – are driven by both education and partisanship.

The undeniable trend

For nearly all of American history, whites without college degrees – the group identified as white working class for the purposes of this survey and in many assessments of the American electorate – made up a majority of the public and a majority of voters.

That has changed, and rapidly, at the same time the nation’s economy has shifted to favor those who hold college degrees. Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 by an electorate in which 63% of voters were whites who had not completed a four-year college education, according to exit polls. That had dropped 10 points by 1992, when Bill Clinton won the presidency. That election marked the last time exit polls would find whites without college degrees to be a majority of voters. By the time Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008, just 39% of those who cast ballots were whites without degrees.

Census figures for voting and registration suggest that the white working class make up a larger share of the electorate than do the exit polls, roughly 44% in 2012 in that estimate. Both data sources have different and unquantifiable sources of error, and there has been some dispute over their true share of the electorate. Regardless of the data source, however, the trend is the same and undeniable – the white working class is shrinking, and at the same time, their ability to influence American politics has declined.

Enter Trump.

Working class white voters have been critical to Trump’s success. Throughout the Republican primaries, Trump’s victories were bolstered by support from whites without degrees. Across 28 states with exit or entrance polls this spring, Trump averaged 50% support among white non-college GOP primary voters or caucus participants, compared with 37% among whites with college degrees.

And across five CNN/ORC polls conducted since the primaries ended in June, Trump’s lead among white non-college voters averages 29 points, while white college voters have broken in Clinton’s direction by an average of 8 points.

Restated in terms similar to the oft-cited gender gap, that adds up to a 37-point education gap among whites. According to exit polls back to 1980, it has never been larger than 14 points.

The white working class shifts Republican

Democrats used to be the party of the white working class, and Republicans, the party of the college educated. Those roles have flipped.

Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director for strategic partnerships at Atlantic Media who has reported extensively on this group, calls it class inversion.

“In the 50s, 60s, and 70s, Democrats ran better among non-college than college whites,” he said. “Starting in the 80s, the two lines converged, and in 2000, (Al) Gore ran better among college than non-college whites, (John) Kerry ran 6 points better, Obama 7 points.”

Some of that is due to the shifting economy. Working class whites were largely synonymous with union members, who are traditionally staunchly Democratic. As the service economy has grown and manufacturing declined, the profile of union members has changed. In 1980, 70% of all voters who came from union households were whites without college degrees; in 2012, the white working class made up just were 39% of voters from union households. Non-whites and white college graduates were each about 30% of the union vote in 2012, almost double their share of the 1980 vote, and those two groups are increasingly Democratic.

But some of it is their differing views on government and change in American society. Within the white working class, those who consider themselves Democrats and those who say they are Republican tend to agree in their assessment of how the working class is doing. About 7 in 10 working class white voters in each party say it’s gotten harder for people like them to find good jobs, and narrow majorities of both say the government isn’t doing enough to help “people like you.”

And while they don’t see exactly eye-to-eye on immigration or the increasing diversity of the United States, both sets of partisans are more apt than their college-educated counterparts to see a negative side to the country’s shifting demographics. Both working class white Democrats and Republicans are more likely than white college educated partisans to feel that the country’s increasing racial and ethnic diversity is harmful because it leaves some people feeling left behind. The same pattern emerges in perceptions of immigrants, with white non-college partisans more apt than white partisans with degrees to say immigrants today are a burden on the United States and that the government should attempt to deport all immigrants currently living in the US illegally.

And in a party whose second-place finisher for this year’s presidential nomination considers himself a socialist, working-class white Democrats are less apt than their college-educated counterparts to consider themselves liberal or to be non-religious, two factors that could be driving them away from the Obama-era Democratic Party.

Among white working class Democrats who are registered to vote, 22% say they would consider voting for Trump, vs. just 2% among white Democrats with college degrees, and nearly a quarter, 23%, say they will definitely not vote for Clinton, a figure that stands at 3% among white Democrats with college degrees.

The effects of this shift are showing in recent swing-state polling. Trump’s best chance to win the presidency comes by flipping rust-belt states where Democrats have had natural advantages in recent presidential elections and which have larger than average blocs of white non-college voters – Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin among them. In each, Trump has cut into Clinton’s advantage with broad support from the white working class.

In the pure battlegrounds, Ohio and Iowa also appear to be shifting Trump’s way on the strength of his support among white non-college voters.

“Democrats have run slightly better among blue-collar whites in Midwestern swing states, and that has been a key to them holding those states,” said Brownstein.

Will they vote?

Majorities of voters across partisan, education, and racial lines say they are dissatisfied with the influence that people like them have on the political process. But there are broader differences when asked about the likelihood of actually turning out to impact that process.

In the CNN/KFF Poll, 71% of white non-college voters said they always vote in presidential elections, and 79% rated the chances that they would vote a 10 out of 10. But both figures were smaller than among whites who do have college degrees, about 9 in 10 in that group said they always vote and would be very likely to this time around.

But a CNN/ORC poll in early September found almost no difference between whites with degrees and those without in terms of enthusiasm about voting this year. Forty-two percent of white college graduates were extremely or very enthusiastic, as were 43% of white non-college registered voters.

Should turnout levels among whites without degrees, whites with degrees and non-whites continue along their current trajectory, the white working class would likely emerge from 2016 still the largest voting bloc in the country in terms of race and educational attainment, for what may be the last time.

The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9 through September 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites – white non-Hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school.

Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 5 points for results among members of the white working class, 6 points for whites with degrees, 10 points for black working class respondents and 9 points for the Hispanic working class.

Story highlights 76% of white working-class evangelicals say they'd consider voting for Trump Half of white working-class evangelical Christians identify as Republicans

(CNN) —

Most white working-class voters who are evangelical Christians – like most white evangelicals – would consider voting for Donald Trump.

But it’s not because they believe he shares their conservative Christian values. Rather, they agree with him that America is not as great as it once was, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll.

While black evangelicals are solidly against the GOP nominee, among white working-class evangelicals, about three in four – 76% – say they’d consider voting for Trump.

Partisanship likely plays a big part in this, as half of white working-class evangelical Christians identify as Republicans.

The majority – 6 in 10 – of voters in this group believe the US’ better days are in the past and most are concerned that the country is becoming less Christian. Nearly 90% of working class whites who are evangelical Christians believe Christian values are under attack in America today.

While most Christian groups – 73% of mainline Protestants and 61% of Catholics – share this view, only 41% of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack.

Trump often says he wants to “make America great again,” and working-class whites are a core of his support, but that doesn’t mean they don’t question the faith of a man who once said he never asks God for forgiveness.

“When listening to him, he’s not a Christian. He does not have any of the values that we have,” said Buddy Mitchell, a 47-year-old from Arvada, Colorado, and owner of a flooring company.

“I don’t know of any redeeming quality of Donald Trump other than both Democrats and Republicans hate him,” said Mitchell, who did not participate in the survey. “That’s the only reason I like him: that the establishment doesn’t like him.”

Christian values seen as under attack

That dislike for the establishment is a strong point for Trump with this demographic. For many white working-class evangelicals, it’s clear who is at fault for many of the country’s issues: the federal government. White working-class evangelicals are also more likely than others to blame the federal government for the economic problems facing the working class.

“I don’t think that either candidate is taking Christian values into consideration,” said Sandra Long, an 80-year-old lifelong Democrat. “Neither one of them is acting very Christian-like. Just a lot of things are said and done. It scares me.”

Long, a Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, resident, is scared that society is becoming more secular and will be a less accepting place for people with more conservative Christian values.

“I feel the country was founded on Christian principles. They came here to get away form being persecuted for their beliefs,” she said. “And now, if our ministers don’t marry a gay couple or refuse to marry a gay couple, they can be arrested and taken to jail.”

While same-sex marriage is legal, religious leaders are not required to marry gay couples.

Darrell Pool, a 60-year-old from Lamar, Colorado, said he doesn’t see his traditional Christian values honored by the leading candidates.

“I don’t see my values shaping the election. There’s just a lot of mayhem,” he said. “I think the values that were in the country’s founding are leaving. The moral values are leaving daily.”

Many white working-class evangelicals have no confidence that either of the presidential candidates has the ability to return the country to their perception of its former glory.

“I don’t know where I am,” said Long. “I’m so confused at this point and time. I don’t believe either one of them should be in office. I don’t believe either one should be running.”

Some have entertained third-party candidates.

“I’m sick to my stomach. I cannot stand Hillary (Clinton) and I can’t stand Trump, so for the first time in my life, I’m thinking of voting Libertarian or not voting,” Mitchell said.

For these voters, the lack of confidence in government is exemplified in the candidacy of Clinton, who has been in government for more than 20 years.

“If you or I would have done what she did with those emails, we’d be in jail,” Mitchell said. “But because she’s the Democratic nominee, they don’t hold politicians to the same standards that they hold the people.”

Many of the standards these voters want to see candidates follow are rooted in the Christian faith.

Security also a concern

But values aren’t the only concerns of these voters. National security is also a major issue to many of these voters, many of whom have personal connections to the military.

“All these refugees they want to bring in, that’s really got me going,” said Pool, who participated in the survey. “They have no idea who they’re bringing in and we just keep having more attacks here.”

“I just think it’s ludicrous and all it’s for is so one party can have more voters,” he said.

The relationship between evangelicals and the refugee issue is a complicated one. Some of the biggest critics of Trump’s proposed Muslim ban have been evangelicals. Christian organizations have been among the most active in helping resettle refugees, but that doesn’t mean some among their flock aren’t anxious.

The majority – 75% – of white working-class evangelicals believe that recent immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US, a higher percentage than other working-class whites.

“I say let’s quit bringing these people in, period,” Pool said. “I realize America is a melting pot and that’s how America started in the first place, but we have a process here. Nobody says you can’t come to this country. Come on in. Let’s do it the right way.”",2016-09-24 00:00:00

Story highlights Problems bothering white Americans without a college degree have less to do with immediate economic insecurity than with the collapse of a whole way of life, writes Stephanie Coontz It's been 40 years in the making, she writes

(CNN) —

The problems bothering white Americans without a college degree have less to do with immediate economic insecurity or material hardship, although those are widespread, than with the collapse of a whole way of life.

Following World War II, production workers experienced three decades of unprecedented economic and social gains. But since the end of the 1970s, they have seen a nearly unremitting decline in their real wages, working conditions and social status, along with a loss of the interpersonal and work networks that were once the basis of their upward progress and their entire community’s stability.

I think it’s fair to say that large segments of the white working-class are feeling shell-shocked.

One pastor who has ministered to a congregation of whites in post-industrial central Philadelphia and to a rural congregation in Wisconsin said this of his parishioners: “Every time something changed in their lives, it changed for the worse. And I mean just about every stinking time.”

The rise and fall of stability in working-class life explains much that otherwise seems puzzling in the responses to this week’s CNN-Kaiser Family Foundation poll. We’ve heard much about working-class anger. Yet the poll reveals a rather uncomplaining acceptance of what is, in many cases, a far from an easy life.

Sixty-three percent of white working-class respondents say they are “very” or “somewhat” satisfied with their personal financial situation, even though in the past year 46% of them say they postponed medical or dental care and half took an extra job or added work hours to make ends meet. About 30% of those who are employed face the stress of work shifts that change every week. But 76% say they are optimistic about what’s going on in their personal life, and 77% of those who are working believe their jobs are secure.

However, this willingness to see the upside of difficult living conditions coexists with a deep pessimism about the future, and especially their children’s future. Fully half of working-class whites expect their children’s lives will be worse than their own. Fewer than one-quarter expect their children to do better.

Working-class blacks and Hispanics are far more optimistic than their white counterparts, even though the unemployment rate of blacks without a college degree is twice as high as that of whites, as is the percentage of black workers who are working part time although they want full-time jobs.

On average, blacks and Hispanics have lower incomes and are less likely to own their homes. They lost more ground than whites during the recession and have regained less ground since. Yet 36% of working-class blacks and 48% of working-class Hispanics believe their children will do better than they.

Another striking difference is that only 45% of whites without a college education, compared to almost 75% of blacks and Hispanics, say their life would be better if they had a four-year college degree. Fifty-one percent of the whites think it would make no difference, and 3% feel it would have made things worse.

These attitudes stem from the tremendous leap forward that white working-class Americans made in the 1950s and 1960s. People who study race relations in America often talk about white privilege, but this is a relative concept when it comes to the working class. For 200 years, elites had encouraged a sense of white superiority to defuse class resentments and head off interracial class alliances. But as in so many conflicts, the foot soldiers of white dominance seldom got a very large share of the spoils.

Low-income whites were given preference over minorities in hiring, wages, and promotions (except during strikes, when employers were quick to replace strikers with minorities whom they fired afterward, reinforcing hostility on both sides).

Yet their relative advantages over workers of other races did not produce a life of privilege for white production workers, who earned low wages with few benefits, faced frequent layoffs and suffered high rates of on-the-job injuries.

Life got better

In the decades after World War II, though, life got much better for white male workers and their families. The tremendous growth of unions, along with new government regulations, put a stop to some of the exploitative practices of employers. Meanwhile, from 1950 to 1979, government invested in infrastructure and new technologies at almost twice the rate since 1980, creating rapid blue-collar job growth.

For the first time, the American Dream came within reach for white blue-collar workers– a dream not of immense wealth but of the ability to sustain a comfortable family life by working hard and well at your job. Between 1947 and 1973, the real wages of the average young male worker without a college education doubled as he moved from age 25 to 35. In 1959, the average 30-year-old man could pay the mortgage on a median-priced home using only 18% of his gross monthly pay.

And his wages continued to rise through his working life as new seniority laws prevented aging workers from being displaced or demoted. A man passing from age 40 to 50 saw his earnings increase by another 30 percent.

Perhaps more important psychologically was that young people in that era could see that they were doing much better than their parents. In 1961, men aged 25 to 29 were, on average, earning four times more in real wages than their fathers at about the same age.

A different kind of success

The basis of success in working-class communities was very different from how success is gained by today’s mobile professionals. Working-class neighborhoods clustered around sources of employment, within walking distance from the small businesses that depended on them for customers, and often within sight of the homes of the managers who supervised them.

There was suspicion of strangers, and racial segregation was the norm, but there was less separation by class and income than today. Their bosses often frequented the same churches. Educated professionals had enough close contact with workers to respect the skill and stamina involved in what economists now call “routine” or “semi-skilled” labor.

At churches, work, and schools, people were enmeshed in stable personal networks that were far from egalitarian but were often the main way young men found a job and small businesses built their base. If you worked hard, respected your place in the social hierarchy, and conformed to community standards, you could expect to get a decent job, have the satisfaction of doing better than your own parents, and see your own kids do better than you.

Coming out of this tradition, it’s no wonder that half of these individuals don’t think having a four-year degree would have helped them. Their frame of reference is a world where you didn’t need to go to college to do better than your father. It often made more sense to simply follow in his footsteps.

The erosion of such communities and workplaces has been going on for almost 40 years. Many manufacturing jobs have been lost or outsourced. Most that are still around or have come back now pay lower wages and provide fewer benefits. Between 1947 and 1979, for example, real wages of meatpacking workers increased by an average of 80 percent (to just under $40,000 per year in constant dollars). But from 1979 to 2012, those wages declined by 30%, to about $27,000 a year.

The old social contract – and the old social contacts – have, for good and for ill, ceased to organize work and community life.

For the past three decades, the average young man without a college degree has consistently done worse than his father. Between 1979 and 2007, young men with a high school degree suffered, on average, a 29% decline in real earnings.

Humans see things in relative terms. When we assess our present position and prospects, we do so in relation to our past experiences and expectations. Most white working-class Americans are still better off than most black and Hispanic non-college-educated workers, but they have been on a long, demoralizing downward slope. By contrast, although blacks and Hispanics started from a much lower base, they have seen remarkable progress since the early 1960s, despite suffering more than whites during recessions.

It is not surprising that so many white workers are pessimistic about their future. Even if their changes for the worse leave them better off than many of their black and Hispanic counterparts, people usually focus more on what they’ve lost rather than on the narrowing edge they may retain over others.

Why not go to college?

But why, many ask, aren’t lower-income white men flocking to college? It’s more complicated than lack of initiative. Ironically, one thing that now holds white working-class men back is the residue of their traditional race and gender bonus: Men who drop out of college initially earn, on average, as much as men who have recently completed their degree.

The college advantage multiplies over time, but it’s tempting – although self-defeating in the long run – to start earning as much as Joe the new college grad without foregoing earnings for several years or taking on debt.

Furthermore, going to college can be risky for people whose parents can’t offer substantial support. Older Americans who brag of working their way through college may not realize that between 1975 and 2015, tuition and fees grew by more than 200% at community colleges and at private, nonprofit, four-year colleges and universities – after accounting for inflation. At public four-year colleges and universities, they grew by nearly 300%.

In 1979, the average student at a four-year university could pay for tuition by working just 182 hours per year. By 2013, the average student had to work 991 hours. And unlike the early 1970s, most available aid takes the form of loans rather than outright grants.

A recent study of 3,000 young adults who entered public four-year institutions in Wisconsin found that even with the help of Pell grants, college was still unaffordable. Only half the students received any credential within six years, a long time to put earnings on hold. Almost 40% dropped out, many saddled with debt that put them further behind than when they started.

Even getting a degree does not guarantee getting a job that allows you to pay off debts. Since 2000, employment of college grads has grown more rapidly in low-earning than high-earning jobs.

Many liberal politicians have failed to acknowledge those realities, and many conservatives have manipulated them to fan racial resentments. It’s not just Trump who’s been stirring the pot. Racial fears have been whipped up for years by the same politicians who now piously denounce them. Think Reagan’s Welfare Queen, George H. Bush’s Willie Horton, Jeb Bush’s “free stuff” remarks, and the Clintons’ “Super-predators.”

Racism is not the only reason for Trump’s popularity. A significant number of Trump supporters say they voted for Obama in 2012, and so far Obama seems to have done better with white working-class voters in Florida, Ohio, and Iowa than Clinton is currently doing.

Blaming it on race

But the legacy of racism runs deep, especially in the old Confederacy. And in the absence of a clear acknowledgement of how and why white working-class men and communities have suffered and without any firm commitment to turn that around, many whites have been persuaded to blame their declining fortunes on blacks and immigrants.

In the 1950s, race outweighed education in determining wage rates. On average, white men with only a high school degree out-earned blacks with a college degree. Today, education outweighs race. But many working-class whites don’t yet realize that this is not a result of reversed racial preferences but of new market preferences:

Studies confirm that employers still favor white men over blacks in most labor markets where applicants have equal education. When nearly identical résumés are sent out, for example, the candidate with a white-sounding name receives more callbacks than the applicant with a black-sounding name.

Some whites look at the gains of black professionals, formerly held back by legally enforced discrimination, and say that “those people” are taking a job that could be theirs. Yet if educated minorities weren’t in the picture, it would be OTHER white people, from more privileged families, taking those jobs. And when liberals respond by framing equal rights as a matter of “compassion” or “tolerance,” without mentioning the growing class divide, it’s not entirely surprising that sections of the white working class mishear calls for diversity as endorsement of their accelerating marginalization.

As one young man complained while we were both waiting for relatives receiving treatment in a New Orleans hospital, “everybody talks about the problems of the blacks, the illegals, the gays, the transgenders. But I see a lot more of them getting ahead than white guys like me.” And an older woman told me “I actually voted for hope and change, but we haven’t gotten it down here, so when Clinton says, ‘oh we already ARE great,’ she loses me.

None of this excuses racist reactions. The tragedy is that in the “good old days” for white Americans without a college degree, their prosperity was less dependent on their unfair advantages over minorities than on a social consensus reaching across both parties that government could and should invest in infrastructure projects that create jobs for working people and enforce policies that protect workers’ bargaining power. In the 1960s, when civil-rights activism extended those opportunities and protections to minorities as well as whites, this resulted in increased progress for workers in general and for racial equality.

The political challenge today is how to acknowledge the legitimate sense of loss and exclusion experienced by white workers while persuading them that reestablishing racial and masculine privileges is a poor substitute for ensuring secure rights for all workers and getting rid of a political decision-making process that is rigged against them by business lobbyists and financial interest groups.

So far, most of Trump’s establishment critics have failed to persuasively explain how they would create well-paying jobs and improve working people’s bargaining power. So we see growing numbers of people who think that in a stacked deck, a “wild card” might not be such a bad thing. As a retired deputy sheriff from Montana put it, Trump is “risky” but at least he’s looking at things “through a different scope.”

Attacking Trump’s unpredictability might even help his cause. The last 40 years have been depressingly predictable for working-class communities and small towns, and Trump’s critics need to establish that they too can be “change agents” – but in a much more substantive way.",2016-09-23 00:00:00
West Virginia's 'forgotten tribe'; why the white working class feels left behind,"White, Working-Class and Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white, working-class Americans and voters, who form a backbone of the support for Donald Trump. Watch Anderson Cooper 360 and CNN.com for reports throughout the week.

Welch, West Virginia (CNN) Each morning for the last 65 years, 93-year-old Ed Shepard has walked to work to open up the Union 76 service station, here in rolling hills of West Virginia coal country.

When he looks out his window, he can see a sweeping mural that shows what life in Welch used to be like. A United Cigars shop on one side of the street, a Western Union sign on the other. Lines of cars stretch into the distance. Even Shepard himself -- who is as much a fixture of Welch as any of its buildings -- is in the mural, a blue cap perched on his head.

""There wasn't ten square feet in this town that didn't have a successful business in it, a business of every kind,"" Shepard said in an interview. ""No matter what you wanted or needed, you could buy it in Welch.""

Those were better days.

Now it's a place, people who live here say, that politicians use as a convenient photo op and that the federal government has left behind, a sentiment common among white working class voters. 56% of non-college educated whites say the government in Washington does not represent them, according to a new poll conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation. And two-thirds say they are dissatisfied with the influence people like them have on politics.

Locals referred to the once-bustling Welch as ""Little New York,"" but now the town and the county around it are slowly slipping away. The storefronts are empty. The buildings and houses here are now crumbling with decay. Shepard used to take checks to the bank each Monday -- sometimes $1,000, sometimes $1,500. He hasn't had to do that in four or five years he said, because he hasn't had one customer in that long.

""It's depressing to watch the population disappear, the businesses disappear and the activity stop. Back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, it was hard to walk up the sidewalk because there was so many people. Now you walk up the sidewalk and there's nobody."" -- Ed Shepard, 93.

""It's depressing to watch the population disappear, the business disappear and the activity to stop,"" he said. ""Back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, it'd be hard to walk up the sidewalk because there was so many people. Now you walk up the sidewalk and there's nobody.""

McDowell County's population is just 19,835 down from 100,000 in the 1950s. That decline is expected to continue. West Virginia University economists estimate that McDowell will continue to lose residents at a rate of 1% each year.

Some, particularly in rural areas like McDowell County, say the government's at fault. Rural working class whites are more likely to blame the federal government for their economic problems than their urban counterparts. Seven in ten say the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for the economic problems facing the working class, in the CNN Kaiser survey, compared with half of urban working class whites. That could explain the appeal of a candidate who is not only intent on upsetting the political system, but has at times seemed bent on breaking it down to start over again.

On this winding drive through the hilly roads of Appalachia, there are few signs signaling support for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but Trump is expected to do well here. West Virginia hasn't voted for a Democrat since Bill Clinton's second term. Much has changed in the last 20 years and now Clinton is seen as squarely at odds with the coal industry, which is the bedrock of Welch and the surrounding county.

No matter who wins in November, some residents of West Virginia coal country don't believe anything will change their lives. They have come to accept, as Gary Hall, a 55-year-old Trump supporter put it, ""that next year is going to be worse than the last year"" no matter who is president.

""When we have a natural disaster in the country, everybody shows up. We're the same as a natural disaster without the effects, without the storm, or without the flood. ... Hopefully we can get it turned around and hopefully we'll get some attention from Washington."" -- Cecil Patterson, 51 (left in photo)

Hall said he felt alienated from the political process, but rejected the idea that he and other whites without college degrees were angry and flocking to Trump as a result. The CNN/Kaiser foundation survey suggests that's the case, too. Just 19% of working class white voters described themselves as angry about how things are going in their own lives.

""We're conditioned that there's really nothing you can do about it. The only thing outrage and protesting and stuff does is cause bad feelings,"" he said. ""People are just resigned to have what they have. The ones that want to leave, the ones that can leave and want to leave leave. Everybody else just stays here.""

Rural working class white voters like Hall are more likely to say America's best days are behind us and that their children will be worse off than they are today. In the CNN/Kaiser survey, 58% of rural working class whites say America's best days have come and gone and 57% say their children will be worse off compared with less than half of urban working class whites who say the same.

West Virginia is one of the nation's largest coal-producing states and McDowell County used to produce more coal than any county here. But there's been a steep downturn in coal jobs across the state due to competition with cheaper natural gas, tougher environmental rules and mechanization, and this county has seen the worst of it.

""We don't have another option,"" said Cecil Patterson, 51, who spent his life working in the coal industry and serves on McDowell County's county commission. ""Once we shut down the coal industry here there's nowhere to go, there's nothing else to do, there's no other jobs available.""

The unemployment rate here was 12.5% in July, compared with 4.9% nationwide.

When work dries up, people leave, Patterson said, doing anything they can to make ends meet.

""She [Hillary Clinton] wants to shut down the coal industry -- that's gonna put me out of a job. Wouldn't be real smart to vote for somebody who's gonna put you out of a job."" -- Ryan Barnette, 34

""You can't just go to the next county here, you have to leave the state. A man tries to go out of the state, maintain an apartment, try to keep his home back up here, it just puts such a struggle on the family.""

Trump won McDowell handily in West Virginia's May primary, taking 91.5% of the Republican vote -- his largest margin of victory in the country. But even before becoming his party's presumptive nominee the week prior, he was the favorite to win in the state.

During a campaign rally in West Virginia in May, Trump promised to bring back lost-coal mining jobs but hasn't said how he'd pull it off. Many people here were skeptical that he could -- but credit him with giving them hope.

And animosity toward Clinton runs high. Even months later, people still repeat -- verbatim -- the comment Clinton made that her climate change policies would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""

Many people here with ties to the coal industry -- virtually everyone here is linked to it -- see Clinton's comments about coal disqualifying and Trump as their only answer.

""It ain't gonna be Hillary,"" said 34-year-old Ryan Barnette, his face black with soot, minutes after leaving the mine. ""She wants to shut down the coal industry -- that's gonna put me out of a job.""

""Our main industry has been coal. When you don't diversify and have other means, then the coal miners are laid off, either they stay and have no money to spend, which trickles down everywhere... Or they eventually have to pack up and move so that they can find work."" -- Elaine LaCaria, 54

Elaine Lacaria -- known here as Laney -- was a lifelong Democrat and voted for Clinton eight years ago. But now things have changed.

""I won't vote for her again. No, never,"" she said in an interview in the dress shop she opened in 2008, the same year then-Senator Barack Obama was elected president.

In the eight years since then, she said things have gotten worse. Jobs have dried up, people are leaving and not coming back and addiction has ravaged this community and others near it.

""When we drive anywhere you see small town USA is no more,"" Lacaria said. ""This has affected all of us, not just the coal fields.""

Lacaria said she'll never vote for a Democrat again and this year, she'll support Trump.

""When I see Trump as a businessman, I think he will help our county definitely, but I think he will help our country as a whole. He knows what he's doing.""

Patterson, who also said he plans to vote for Trump due to his support of the coal industry, said the same.

""When we wake up the morning after an election, our roads are going to be getting worse, our sewer, our water, our schools are failing, Patterson said. ""They want us to keep paying more and we keep getting less, so there's my take on where we're at the day after the election.""

""We look different, we talk different, and people seem to think we don't exist. But if you're hungry, we'll split our last meal with you. If you're cold, we'll get you some kind of--to stay warm. We give everything that we got. And we get nothing back."" -- Vira Rose, 69

Others, like 69-year-old Vira Rose, say no politician or government got them in this position. And they don't expect to be saved.

Rose, who was one of the first women to work as a mine foreman in the area, owns her own auto repair shop. She once sold new tires, now a stack of used tires for sale sits outside of the shop. People can't afford new ones anymore, she said.

""Sometimes I come here at 8 a.m., I get out of here at 8 or 9 at night. Any job comes, you don't turn it down and say tomorrow. If you say tomorrow, tomorrow won't be here. You grab it, you do it -- then you help others,"" she said. ""We're the forgotten tribe.""

She has no faith in Clinton or Trump.

""What am I gonna do? I'm not gonna vote for neither damn one of them,"" Rose said. ""Because there's not much difference, there's really not.""",2016-09-20 00:00:00

Story highlights White working-class Americans form the backbone of Donald Trump's political support New data suggests they have complicated viewson immigrants from Muslim countries

Editor’s Note: White, Working-Class and Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white, working-class Americans and voters, who form a backbone of the support for Donald Trump. Watch Anderson Cooper 360 and CNN.com for reports throughout the week.

(CNN) —

The white, working-class Americans who form a backbone of Donald Trump’s political support have a split view of Muslim immigrants – strong majorities believe both that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the threat of terrorism in the United States, but also that most immigrants from those countries are good people.

The data is from a new survey from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation and is aimed at unveiling the political motivations of the voting bloc that has propelled the GOP nominee.

Threats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the White House and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif., and most recently after the attacks in New York and New Jersey. Polls generally show that voters trust Trump more than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism.

Trump’s tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the US-Mexico border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise.

While a majority (63%) of white, working-class Americans say immigrants from Muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks.

Members of this group, which exit polls had at around 44% of the US electorate in 2012 though the exact figure is difficult to quantify, also have a more negative view of immigration: nearly half (47%) of whites without a college degree view immigrants as a burden on the country.

Even among those white, working-class voters who view immigrants as a burden, 50% say immigrants from Muslim countries are good people compared with 35% who say they are not.

There is also a partisan divide: White, working-class Democrats are more likely to hold positive views about immigrants from Muslim countries than their white, working-class Republican counterparts. 47% of white Democrats without college degrees say Muslim immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US compared with 83% of white Republicans with no college degree.

Trump has made his hard line against Muslims a key component of his campaign, and his white, working-class supporters have strong views about the impact of immigrants from Muslim countries. Fifty-three percent of white voters without college degrees who are considering supporting Trump say immigrants from Muslim countries are basically good, but 82% say they increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US.

’Under attack’

More than 6-in-10 white, working-class Americans also say that Christian values are under attack in the United States. That viewpoint is more widespread among older working-class whites than among younger ones. Seventy-three % of white, working class adults 65 and older said Christian values are under attack, while just 41% of working-class adults under the age of 30 said the same.

Trump backers were more likely to say that Christian values were under attack than those who support Clinton. Eighty-one percent of white, working-class voters who would consider supporting him in November said Christian values were under attack, compared to 31% who support Clinton.

Candidate positioning

In the hours following the bombings in New York and New Jersey, Clinton and Trump tussled over who was better qualified to combat terrorism as well as its cause.

Clinton cast herself as the candidate best prepared to combat terrorism and said that her opponent’s positions are “not grounded in fact” and “meant to make some kind of demagogic point.”

“I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges,” the former secretary of state told reporters on Monday, “not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric.”

Trump blamed Clinton and President Barack Obama for failing to keep the country safe and called for profiling to beef up what he sees as currently lackluster anti-terrorism efforts. Instead of treading lightly, Trump said on Fox News Monday morning, the better approach would be to “knock the hell out of ‘em.”

“Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are,” Trump told Fox. “They are afraid to do anything about it, because they don’t want to be accused of profiling. And they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things.”

The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9 through September 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites – white non-Hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 5 points for results among members of the white working class, 6 points for whites with degrees, 10 points for black working class respondents and 9 points for the Hispanic working class.

"Working class whites blame Washington, but still want more government help","All his life, Chris Olah was told you can't trust the government.

His grandfather and his father drilled it into his head that you have to rely on yourself and can't expect the government to bail you out.

Olah, 43, still believes the federal government is to blame for many of the problems affecting working class Americans like himself. Yet, the Frenchville, Pennsylvania, resident would like Washington D.C. to do more to help people like him who have fallen on hard times. He's struggling to find work despite having just earned an associate's degree in criminal justice.

""The government is not putting enough emphasis on keeping jobs in America for American people,"" said Olah, who assembled Ford trucks in Virginia for 13 years before the company consolidated truck production closer to Detroit. ""We should get more help for educated people to go to work.""

Many in the white working class share Olah's sentiments, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Some 62% of white working class Americans said the federal government bears all or most of the blame for the economic troubles facing the working class. Yet, two-thirds also feel that the federal government doesn't do enough to help working class folks.

Working class whites with lower incomes are more than twice as likely as their higher-earning peers to want more government assistance.

While there's no set definition of the working class, CNN/KFF considers this group to include those without four-year college degrees for this poll.

Among college-educated whites and working class blacks and Hispanics, the share that blame the government is less than half. And when it comes to whether the feds could do more to help the working class, 54% of educated whites agreed, while more than two-thirds of working class blacks and Hispanics stand with their white peers that the government could provide more assistance.

However, some in the white working class want the federal government to do more for them specifically. Just over a third think Washington already does too much for racial and ethnic minorities, and 63% think it does too much for the wealthy.

Where Olah lives, in rural Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, only 11.1% of white, non-Hispanic residents age 25 and older hold bachelor's degrees -- the lowest share among larger counties in the U.S. And, 93% of the county's roughly 80,000 residents are white, non-Hispanics, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics.

Olah moved to Clearfield in 2007 to be closer to his now ex-wife's family and worked as a mechanic for several years. After being laid off, he enrolled in York Career Institute. He just graduated last month. He has applied to the jails in the area, as well as at a Walmart distribution center, but he has yet to land anything.

He went back to school because he thought it was the only way to find a decent-paying job to support his two teen children. Now, he's saddled with $22,000 in student loans. To get by, Olah and his kids receive $311 in food stamps and $264 in cash assistance each month, as well as public health coverage and a home energy subsidy.

Still, Olah believes politicians and government workers at all levels are ineffective at best and corrupt at worst. They still get paid, he stresses, although nothing gets done to help struggling Americans like him. He'd like to see the federal government make college more affordable, revamp safety net programs to assist more people with low-wage jobs and provide more incentives for companies to create jobs.

Some 34% of working class whites polled by CNN/KFF said someone in their household received government benefits in the past year (excluding Social Security and Medicare). That compares to 21% of college-educated whites, 61% of working class blacks and 48% of working class Hispanics. The most common benefits included Medicaid (19%), disability (12%) and food stamps (11%).

Those already receiving public assistance are more likely than those who don't get aid to say the government doesn't do enough to help people like them, by a 63% to 47% split.

Getting more aid to pay for higher education was a popular request among the Clearfield residents CNNMoney interviewed. Good paying positions that require only a high school diploma -- in the coal mines, brickyards and sewing factories -- have long since disappeared, and minimum-wage jobs in fast food or retail don't cover the bills, locals said. It wouldn't be hard for them to enroll as there are five colleges and technical schools in the county, including a branch of Pennsylvania State University.

""You can't get by without a degree,"" said Shyanne Lowe, 22, a married mother of two who just started studying for an associate's degree in nursing at the Clearfield branch of Lock Haven University. ""We tried the working class lifestyle and you can't get ahead.""

Lowe, who also works part-time at the front desk of a local hotel, said the federal government is going deeper into debt giving pay raises to politicians and aid to other countries. Meanwhile, Americans pay high taxes but don't get free college, health care and other benefits that citizens in other nations receive.

Instead, the government should provide more assistance to those trying to move up the economic ladder, said Lowe, whose husband is studying for his bachelor's degree in economics at Penn State and works part-time at a furniture and appliances store. She would like to see the feds lower tuition, offer paid maternity and paternity leave and make subsidized day care more widely available.

Right now, the Lowes are paying most of their bills by taking out student loans, which they expect to climb into the six figures by the time they are done with school. They also receive food stamps, public health coverage and WIC assistance for women, infants and children. They are on a waiting list for subsidized day care, which currently costs them $900 a month for their two-year-old son and infant daughter.

""There's no way we'd advance if we didn't do it this way,"" said Lowe, who lives in Clearfield borough.

It didn't used to be like this in Clearfield County, which lies within the tree-covered rolling hills just off Interstate-80. Like in other parts of the U.S., high school graduates used to be able to make a comfortable living. The disappearance of those opportunities has fueled resentment among the working class.

Robin Holt, 57, sees the struggles firsthand as a staffer at Central PA Community Action, a non-profit social services agency in Clearfield. Its clientele includes unemployed middle-aged men living in shelters with few job prospects. The federal government has good programs to help the needy, she said, but it must fund them better and make them more effective.

Related: These Americans are fighting to bring manufacturing jobs back

Holt, who also owns two rental properties and a laundromat, wonders why the feds bailed out the banks during the Great Recession instead of doing more to directly help Americans. The banks only made it harder for people to take out loans, said the West Decatur, Pennsylvania, resident.

""If they gave everyone $100,000, that would have kick-started a lot of people,"" she said.

Holt is saddled with $15,000 in student loans that got her halfway through a bachelor's degree in business management from Lock Haven University several years ago. She doesn't know whether it's worth the money to finish since well-paying jobs are hard to find in Clearfield these days. She makes $10.45 an hour now, compared to $12 an hour in the 1980s when she worked at a local sewing factory.

Over and over again, those interviewed in Clearfield voiced disdain for government at all levels: Elected officials make promises they don't keep and don't get anything done. Bureaucrats just collect a paycheck and don't try to help those in need.

That's why Heather Grimm, 33, doesn't bother voting. The single mother lives with her two young boys and fiancee, Jesse Harnish, in subsidized housing, which eats up about 40% of his monthly income from driving school and charter buses. She thinks politicians are greedy and the system is broken.

Related: The anatomy of a white working class Trump voter

Grimm, who worked from the age of 16 until nearly four years ago, said jobs in the area don't pay enough for her to buy a car and to put her kids in after-school programs. And if she were employed, she'd also lose her food stamps and other public assistance.

The Clearfield borough, Pennsylvania, resident thinks the deck is stacked against working class folks like her.

""The government makes the rules for us to follow,"" said Grimm. ""But people get fed up. We are doing what we are supposed to be doing, but we're not getting anywhere.""

"The economy stinks, but I'm doing OK, say working class whites","Social Security is running out of money. America gives too much aid to other countries. Nothing is made in the U.S.A. anymore.

Those are some of the reasons why working class whites feel the economy is headed in the wrong direction. Some 53% of these folks said they are very dissatisfied with the country's economic situation, well above the share among whites with college degrees or working class blacks and Hispanics. Another 25% said they are somewhat dissatisfied, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation survey.

What's more, they think their children will suffer as a result. Half feel their kids' standard of living will be worse when they hit the same age.

This gloomy view, however, doesn't extend to their own financial circumstances.

Nearly two-thirds of working class whites say they are satisfied with their own personal financial situation. More than three-quarters are optimistic about how things are going in their own lives. A similar share of those who are working feel their jobs are secure.

Take Pete McGuire of Mansfield Center, Connecticut. McGuire, who runs a landscaping company with his wife, was frustrated recently when he couldn't find work boots made in the United States at Cabela's, an outdoor recreation retailer.

""We're not making anything,"" McGuire said, noting that the few American products he does find are often more expensive. ""I'd be willing to pay a little more to buy something made in the U.S.A. to keep somebody working here.""

The 61-year-old ticked off why he thinks the nation is in trouble: The national debt is growing. The federal government is doing more to help other countries than struggling Americans. Veterans are being ignored.

His four daughters will have to deal with all of this. And most of them ""are making ends meet by the skin of their teeth."" Two are stay-at-home moms and one is a teacher's assistant in an elementary school. The one who is doing the best financially became an accountant after graduating from the University of Connecticut.

As for his own financial security? ""We're comfortable. We are paying our bills,"" said McGuire, who recently applied for disability because of back problems that have forced him to cut back at the landscaping firm.

McGuire feels he was able to build a more secure life because the economy was better during most of his working years. After he graduated high school, he was always employed -- in textile factories, for the state, in a construction company and finally at his own small business, often holding second jobs on the side pumping gas or mowing lawns. His wife, who has a bachelor's degree, works for the city of Norwich, providing job coaching for mentally handicapped kids. He has a small pension and retiree health care, thanks to his tenure with the state Department of Transportation.

Nowadays, he feels, it's harder for blue-collar workers to make a decent living.

""When was the last time a factory worker got a pay raise of more than a dime or a quarter?"" he said.

Working class whites were less likely to get a boost in pay than their college educated peers. The poll found some 42% of working age people in this group said they or someone in their household had received a raise in the last year, compared to 54% of whites with college diplomas.

It's not surprising that many working class whites have a negative view of the nation's economic direction, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. Americans are often more dour if their political party is not in power. And since many working class whites lean Republican, they feel the Obama administration has made things worse. (Some 53% of working class white Americans CNN/KFF surveyed said they were Republicans or leaned that way, while 33% said they were Democrats or Democratic-leaners and 11% independents.)

Related: The anatomy of a white working class Trump voter

Plus, Republican nominee Donald Trump and his onetime rivals spent the past year decrying how troubled the nation is, he said.

""People are more likely to the take the party line about the state of the economy than their own private economic circumstances,"" Burtless said. ""If we had a President McCain or a President Romney, they'd say the economy isn't so bad.""

Los Angeles resident David Gibson typifies this view.

""Everything Obama and his administration does is wrong,"" said Gibson, 82, who just retired as the owner of a real estate escrow business. ""I'm not sure Obama knows what he's doing and he doesn't listen to people.""

The president's actions haven't directly hurt Gibson's finances, however. He worked well beyond the typical retirement age because he liked it and now plans to live off savings and investments. His daughter and grown grandson are also employed and doing fine.

But among his circle of friends, there's a lot of concern over the economy, national security and America's standing in the world.

Related: The economy needs a Cheerleader-in-Chief

""It's a feeling that everyone is on pins and needles,"" he said, noting that the economy is only growing at a 1% rate and many people have dropped out of the labor market because they can't find jobs. ""You don't know what's going to happen. We're a ship without a captain right now.""

Others, like Nicole King, feel the nation's problems have been building for a while and blames both parties for not coming together to address the issues.

King, who watches both CNN and Fox and listens to NPR to get a variety of views, said she is concerned about the shaky state of Social Security and the mounting national debt. She also fears the next generation is not as hard working, which will further damage the economy.

""All those things together don't paint a very positive picture,"" said King, 40, who feels her job in a bank's IT department is secure. ""The U.S. as a brand is not as strong as it once was.""

The Charlotte, N.C., resident and her husband are on a very strict budget so they can save money for retirement and their children's college education. They buy used cars and gave their older daughter, who is 3, a piggy bank so she will learn the value of money at an early age. And they worry that their daughters will not be as comfortable as they are because the economy is so troubled.

Part of working class whites' frustration with the nation's direction stems from their feeling marginalized in society, said Arlie Hochschild, a professor emerita in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the new book, Strangers In Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right.

They think the nation views them as uneducated and racist, Hochschild said. Their pro-life views are demonized, while they feel under attack from the rise of secularism. And the tipping point is that their path upwards on the economic ladder is blocked by the decline of the middle class.

Yet, at the same time, they draw happiness from living in their own isolated enclaves with family, neighbors and fellow churchgoers nearby.

(CNN) —

Mudslides and floods have killed more than 450 people in Sierra Leone including more than 150 children. That number is expected to rise as hundreds are missing.

SEYLLOU/AFP/Getty Images Sierra Leone buried at least 300 victims of devastating floods.

Torrents of mud wiped away entire communities. Nearly 20,000 people have been displaced.

“Many of our compatriots have lost their lives, many more have been gravely injured, and billions of leones’ worth of property [has been] destroyed in the flooding and landslides that swept across some parts of our city,” President Ernest Koroma said.

Manika Kamara/AP Volunteers search for bodies from the scene of heavy flooding and mudslides in Regent, just outside of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown.

Safe drinking water and shelter are now the immediate priorities for thousands of people, according to the United Nations. One of the main concerns is an outbreak of cholera and malaria.

“Some residents have gotten skin infections from the water they have been washing in, and officials are putting in place plans for cholera preparedness and prevention,” Deputy Health Minister Madina Rahman said. “We are equipped to a point. We can’t do it alone.”

Drug addiction: There is help,"(CNN) —

In 2017, nearly 70,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States. That’s a 6.6 percent increase over the previous year’s death toll according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For anyone battling drug addiction, facing that “I need help” moment and knowing where to turn are crucial initial steps. The recovery process can be ridden with pain, denial and shame.

Trying to find the best treatment for you or a loved one can be overwhelming.

How can I get help?

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration offers a website where you can type in your ZIP code and get directions to nearby treatment centers.

The agency also offers a 24-hour free hotline for treatment referrals and support: 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Calls are confidential and offered in English and Spanish.

For treatment options tailored to the needs of veterans, the Veterans Crisis Line directs those who have served and their loved ones to “qualified, caring Department of Veterans Affairs responders through a confidential toll-free hotline”: 1-800-273-8255, option 1.

The department’s website says veterans of all “ages and circumstances” can also chat online and text 838255 for support options. The organization says since its inception it has answered more than 2 million calls and dispatched emergency responders more than 70,000 times to callers in distress.

According to the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, about 10 million Americans, aged 12 to 29, need treatment for substance abuse and addiction. The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids offers a toll-free hotline: 1-855-DRUGFREE (378-4373) to assist parents who are seeking help for their children.

Above the Influence is a website for young adults who want to get help for themselves or a friend with an addiction. The site describes warning signs and offers resources for treatment.

Treatment options

Treatment options are not created equal nor one-size-fits-all. When considering a program, the National Institute on Drug Abuse recommends choosing a treatment method that is backed by solid scientific evidence. The organization also recommends asking whether a program customizes treatment to the individual needs of each patient, taking into account a patient’s background and particular history with drug abuse.

“Without attending to the social issues [of an individual] we will not see as great of an effect as potentially possible,” says Jack Stein, the institute’s Director of the Office of Science Policy and Communications. “We need to approach substance abuse disorder from a ‘whole person’ perspective.”

Stein also recommends selecting a treatment program that uses a combination therapy approach: one that addresses both detoxifying and the long-term needs of the individual.

Both Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous are great resources for continued support during and after a treatment program.

“We try to encourage families to understand that relapse can occur, but the individual can recover,” Stein said.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse encourages families to view addiction as a chronic disorder like heart disease or asthma, which requires “support and vigilance on the part of the individual.” Staying connected to a community like a local support group is key.

The impact of a little boy named Youssif,"Story highlights Masked men doused Youssif with gas and set him on fire in 2007 After his story aired, CNN viewers donated to his cause Youssif had extensive facial reconstruction and counseling in the United States

Editor’s Note: Arwa Damon is a senior international correspondent based in CNN’s Istanbul bureau. In April, she received the World of Children’s 2017 Crisis Award for her work starting INARA, a charity which aids children affected by war. While at the ceremony, Damon had the chance to spend time with a young man who holds a special place in her heart. The opinions in this article are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

“Superman is one of my favorite superheroes because he also struggled to fit in and was different, but in the end he was accepted and made his mark and I can somehow relate to that,” said Youssif to those gathered at the World of Children gala in Los Angeles in April.

Now in his early teens, he looked so handsome, confident and unwavering. This was the same young man we had met a decade ago who was sullen, angry and mad at a world he was too young to even understand.

“All children should have a chance to make their dreams come true,” Youssif said at the conclusion of his speech.

The beautifully dressed crowd burst into a standing ovation, and I was there on the stage next to him.

I couldn’t help the tears that stung my eyes. Tears of pride and awe. Tears at the injustice he had suffered and the thought that no one, no child should ever go through anything like he did. Tears of hope stemming from the knowledge that we can still make a difference if we unite.

And to echo what I said then, my voice cracking, “I think what is so amazing about this moment is that Youssif doesn’t realize how much he has given all of us.”

We first met and reported Youssif’s story in August 2007.

I remember him sitting in our kitchen at the CNN Baghdad bureau, his face a hardened mask of scar tissue. He was pushing one grain of rice at a time through lips he could barely open.

Masked men had doused 4-year-old Youssif with gas and set him on fire as he played outside his Baghdad home. His parents were at a loss. All they wanted was their little boy back — and to hear him laugh again.

I remember how anxious we all were before the story aired, not knowing what reaction it would generate. And most of all, I remember calling his parents, the best phone call I have had the honor and pleasure of making, to say, “Your little boy is going to get help.”

Family photos Donations from CNN viewers worldwide paid for Youssif and his family to fly to the United States for medical treatment.

For the outpouring of support came from all over the world; it transcended boundaries, cultures and religions. The Children’s Burn Foundation in Los Angeles took on Youssif’s case and CNN viewers donated hundreds of thousands of dollars.

For our Iraqi staff at the time, living in Baghdad under constant bombardment and threat, the tremendous response to Youssif’s story gave them hope. It gave them hope that the world had not entirely turned away. That there were people out there whose voices we may not always have the opportunity to hear, but who cared.

CNN Youssif walks along the California beach with CNN's Arwa Damon, who first told the boy's story in 2007.

For CNN, reporting Youssif’s story led to the launch of the Impact Your World initiative. For the last 10 years, Impact has identified vetted organizations helping those in need across the globe so viewers can donate and make a difference.

And for me, the public’s reaction after Youssif’s report aired served to remind me of the kindness of strangers and planted the first thoughts of how I could potentially engage that generosity. Those thoughts led to starting my nonprofit, the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance (INARA).

INARA is turning two years old and has helped dozens of children impacted by war who have fallen though the gaps, who need life-altering or lifesaving medical care not provided by others. Children like Youssif.

Today, he no longer remembers the attack, but he remembers the people who helped him and his family. Over the years, Youssif has undergone multiple surgeries and there is still the potential for many more to come. He wants to be a doctor so he, too, can one day help others.

That is the ripple effect of one little boy’s story, a story whose impact is not yet over – a true testament to the power we have when we remember our humanity and compassion.",2017-08-07 00:00:00
Preschool girl lifts widower's spirit,"Dan Peterson and Norah Wood had a memorable encounter at a store.

Story highlights A 4-year-old girl strikes up conversation with lonely senior citizen 82-year-old Dan Peterson's wife died six months earlier

(CNN) —

Four-year-old Norah Wood of Augusta, Georgia, went with her mother to the grocery store to buy some birthday cupcakes. She ended up changing a life.

It started late last month with some simple kind words she shouted to a lonely older man in the aisle. He was taciturn and “stone-faced” Norah’s mother, Tara Wood, told CNN on Thursday.

“Hi, old person!” Norah yelled from her cart. “It’s my birfday today!”

The man’s face lit up.

“How old are you today?” he asked.

They chatted briefly and even exchanged hugs.

“It was only a 10-minute encounter at the grocery store, but it felt magical and divine,” the mom said.

Mother and daughter left with a happy memory, and a photo Norah insisted her mother snap.

Tara Wood The new friendship will get a boost around Thanksgiving.

That could have been the end of the story. But it is actually the beginning of a special relationship.

When Tara Wood posted that photo on Facebook, someone recognized the gentleman, passed along his contact information and wrote, “That’s the first time I’ve seen that man smile since his wife died.”

Dan Peterson, 82, lost his beloved wife in March and fell into deep depression. Six months later, he had his chance encounter with Norah at the store.

“That day, I was going through a day of self-pity. I was just feeling sorry for myself,” he told CNN. “But she changed it.”

With a fresh shave and haircut, Peterson invited the mother and daughter to his home.

In the weeks since, the Wood family has built a loving relationship with the man they call “Mr. Dan.”

He plans to spend a day around Thanksgiving with Norah, her parents and six siblings.

“She has shown me a depth of love, a depth I didn’t know existed,” Peterson told CNN.

(CNN) —

In 2011, the peaceful uprising in Syria spiraled into civil war, quickly becoming one of the bloodiest conflicts in the world today.

You can aid the civilians struggling to survive in Syria – with food, shelter, medical aid and other basic needs.

The United Nations estimates that 6 million civilians are internally displaced, desperate to find safety in the destroyed cities, facing the constant threat of gunfire in the streets and bombs from the skies.

More than 5 million Syrians who have fled the country face uncertainty as well.

Syrian refugees also attempt the dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea, seeking refuge in Europe. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that in 2017, 172,301 refugees and migrants from Syria and other countries made this perilous journey. They also report that 3,119 refugees did not survive.

Sex trafficking survivor who wants to end 'The Game',"Story highlights Elle Snow was trafficked for sex in California She founded 'Game Over' to protect other girls from the misery she went through

(CNN) —

Elle Snow laces up her combat boots, prepared once again, to go to war with “The Game.”

“The [purchasers] really want new products all the time,” says Snow. “The [sex] traffickers like to move their victims frequently so they can’t get to know anyone and it’s harder for law enforcement to track them.”

For Snow, a native of Eureka, a town in rural northern California, this fight against sex trafficking is personal. She says she was 19 when she was first approached by an older man, who expressed an interest in dating her.

“I met my trafficker the same way a lot of us do,” says Snow. “You always hear, ‘I met a guy.’ And he was here in rural Humboldt County and we kept bumping into each other. I took this as fate and he portrayed it that way. He met my mom, he met my family. I didn’t realize that I had been marked.”

’This is how prostitutes are made’

For Snow, it seemed to be a whirlwind, intoxicating romance.

But that quickly changed, once her boyfriend invited her to Sacramento and got her away from her family and friends.

“The next morning, I woke up and this man was standing in front of me. He had these 6 inch heels which I’ve never worn heels in my life being 6 feet tall and this little pink skirt. I’ve never worn pink in my life. And he wanted me to put these on and told me I had to get to work.”

Elle Snow

At first Snow thought he was joking.

“I told him ‘I’m on vacation, like, what are you talking about?’ And he’s telling me you’re not you anymore. This is not your name. Your name is now ‘Angel.’” Snow recalls.

“There was no way to get out of this situation. He took my clothes, my shoes, my keys, my phone, and eventually he started saying he is not who he said he was, that he’s actually a pimp, and this is how prostitutes are made.”

Snow wanted to run, but the trafficker threatened to harm her 14-year-old sister.

“The next thing I know was being taken to a brothel,” Snow says. “I was trafficked throughout the [San Francisco] Bay Area for eight months of my life.”

Snow says she tried to escape several times. Usually her trafficker would laugh at her, but one time in particular stands out, when an attempt to leave became physical and she feared her life was at risk.

He was dragging my body to a car when I woke up. Elle Snow, trafficking survivor, founder ""Game Over""

“I punched him and knocked his tooth out and he got up; I ran into the bathroom. And then for the next few hours I was beat bloody,” she recalls. “I was strangled. He was dragging my body to a car when I woke up. My throat was so swollen and black and blue. I still have busted capillaries in it from all that.”

Surviving ‘The Game’

Snow eventually managed to escape with the help of a friend. In 2014, she testified against her trafficker, David Bernard Anderson, who was on trial, accused of trafficking a 16-year-old girl.

Anderson, who went by the moniker “King David,” was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison.

During that time, Snow realized Anderson was one of many men and women following a set of carefully laid-out rules and guidelines for how to force women into prostitution.

“What happened to me was called ‘The Game,’ this monstrous beast that is this world of sex trafficking,” she explains. “These guys have a complete structure, they have books, they have documentaries, they have podcasts.”

Kyla Baxley was the lead investigator on the case, for Humboldt County’s District Attorney’s Office.

“It’s important to remember victims of sexual assault and exploitation didn’t choose this,” says Baxley. “Realizing that it was happening here in Humboldt, and having an interaction with Elle Snow, being one of the victims, really helped raised awareness of this issue in the community.”

Humboldt County District Attorney Investigator Kyla Baxley was named ""Investigator of the Year"" by the California Sexual Assault Investigators Association.

And through the course of the trial, Snow came to two important conclusions. None of this was her fault and it hadn’t happened by accident.

In 2016, she founded the anti-trafficking non-profit Game Over, dead-set on protecting other girls from the trauma and misery she went through herself.

“I called Kyla and I told her, I’m going to do something about this,” says Snow. “I’m going to make the world know about ‘The Game.’ They need to know or else they are susceptible to it.”

Fighting back

Now Snow spends many of her days monitoring sex ads on online classified sites, looking for trends.

“I am looking to see who they’re coming in with, this someone showing up and then the same day another person showing up with the same area code.

“And I’m looking for tattoos because traffickers like to brand their victims. The brandings tend to consist nowadays mainly of names. Especially names with a crown on the chest or neck. Also, anything to do with currency, diamonds, money bags as well as anything to do with ‘loyalty to the family,’ ‘loyalty to the game,’ ‘made by,’ or ‘property of.’”

In addition to investigating real-time cases of human trafficking herself, Snow is also training law enforcement and speaking to local schools.

Recently, she co-wrote and produced a play with three students from the Dell’Arte International School of Physical Theatre. Called “Jane Doe in Wonderland,” it’s a modern re-interpretation of the Lewis Carroll classic, based on Snow’s own experiences. CNN attended a recent evening performance in front of a packed house at Eureka High School.

“If you’re putting posters everywhere and everybody’s talking about it and they’re saying, ‘Hey, I know what a pimp is. I know those books.’ Then all of a sudden the traffickers don’t feel comfortable anymore,” says Snow.

Rex Bohn, Humboldt County’s 1st District Supervisor, was in attendance that night. He says he’s been impressed on how quickly Snow’s made a difference in this community.

And traffickers in Northern California should be on guard, listening for Snow’s hard-soled footsteps, and the legion of newly informed supporters, charging up behind them.",2017-06-28 00:00:00

Story highlights Immokalee once known as 'ground zero' for modern slavery Florida town epicenter of US tomato production CIW nonprofit helped improve conditions of vulnerable workers

(CNN) —

Alejandrina Carrera is covered from head to toe.

Long pants tucked into her shoes. Long sleeves tucked into her gloves. And layers of material covering her entire head and face, a protective shield against the brutal south-Florida sun.

Today, the oppressive heat is her only worry.

Yet that wasn’t the case when Carrera first came to the United States from Mexico 20 years ago, a migrant farmworker in search of a better life. She was just 14 years old, scared, vulnerable, and alone.

“I was very young, I didn’t have my father or mother, no one,” she says.

Alejandrina Carrera working on a tomato farm in Immakolee, Florida.

Carrera says she found work on a farm, and it wasn’t long before her supervisor tried to take advantage of her. He promised her an easier job inside a warehouse. But as soon as she got in his truck, she says, he drove to a remote part of the farm and tried to force her to have sex with him.

“He told me if we don’t do this the easy way, we’ll do it the hard way. I was afraid and trembling,” she says.

Now 35, Carrera recalls with gratitude the farmworker who heard her screams and rescued her before she could be raped. She also remembers how they both were fired the next day.

Protections against that type of labor abuse against migrant workers in the United States were virtually non-existent in the 1990’s.

“No one knew anything about rights,” Carrera says. “We didn’t seek out what our worker rights were. We just accepted everything they told us and just did our jobs.”

Coalition of Immokalee Workers

In 1993, a group of American activists and migrant farmworkers decided to change that. They founded the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to improving wages and working conditions of migrant farmworkers.

The organization is named after the migrant town of Immokalee, Florida, the epicenter of tomato production in the United States. Ninety-percent of all winter tomatoes consumed in the US come from Florida. Immokalee also used to be known as ground zero for modern day slavery.

CIW co-founder Laura Germino explains how the group evolved into an anti-slavery organization.

“We began to come across situations where workers were being held against their will, where they weren’t free to leave,” Germino says.

Courtesy Lisa Cohen, CNN A truck on a tomato farm in Immokalee.

The first case they discovered was eventually prosecuted in a federal case called U.S. vs Flores.

“In that one, we found out that workers were being held by armed guards, prevented from leaving, pistol whipped, some sexually assaulted, and it was a crew of 500 workers,” says Germino.

Germino says she and her colleagues initially thought it was just a single case. An anomaly, she says.

“But then we came across another case and another case and that’s how I became introduced to labor trafficking.”

Since that first case, the CIW has uncovered and helped the US government successfully prosecute eight cases of slave labor on Florida farms.

The cases are highlighted in a mobile museum that Germino uses to educate people about the issue.

Fair Food Program

Today, the CIW’s focus is no longer uncovering cases of slavery. Instead, it’s aim is preventing them from happening in the first place through an initiative it calls the Fair Food Program.

Participants in the program, which include 90% of tomato growers in Florida, allow CIW staff to come onto their properties and hold mandatory education sessions for all employees. The workers receive booklets that outline their rights and a hotline to call if they experience violations.

The growers also agree to regular third-party inspections of their farms. When they visit, a team of auditors speaks confidentially with at least 50% of workers to ensure their rights are being respected.

The Fair Food Program operates in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey.

Laura Safer Espinoza is a former Supreme Court Justice for the State of New York. She now spends her retirement in Florida, running the Fair Food Standards Council, which oversees the audits.

“Places that were called ground zero for modern day slavery by federal prosecutors a few years ago are now cited by national and international human rights experts as the best work environment in U.S. agriculture,” she says.

Judge Laura, as she is affectionately called by everyone who works with her, says the code works because it was created by the very people it is designed to protect.

“The code that we get to monitor and enforce is unique because it was written by workers who are the ultimate experts on human rights in the agricultural settings in which they work.”

The program also includes real market consequences for farms if violations are found.

Courtesy Lisa Cohen/CNN Workers pick tomatoes on a farm in Immokalee, Florida.

As Judge Laura explains, “if a participating grower is not complying with the code of conduct after multiple chances and opportunities with the Fair Food Standards Council to work toward compliance, ultimately they are suspended. That means they cannot sell their produce to now 14 major retail buyers.”

Those buyers include many of the biggest fast food restaurants and grocery stores, including McDonalds, Taco Bell, Whole Foods Market and Walmart. As part of the agreement, they all pledge to purchase tomatoes only from Fair Food Program farms.

They also agree to pay a penny more per pound of tomatoes, money that goes directly to the farmworkers as a line-item bonus. In some cases, it doubles their paychecks.

Alejandrina Carrera appreciates the extra money, but is most grateful for the change in how she is treated on the job.

“You’re not going to be harassed, you’re not going to be insulted, you’re not going to be forced to work. There’s more respect now,” she says.

Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure,"Story highlights Tony's Chocolonely chocolate claims to be made with no slave labor Cocoa sector has battled with poor labor practices and exploitation

(CNN) —

From its base in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam, a confectionery company is doing its bit to fight modern-day slavery.

Its unconventional weapon of choice? A rich range of chocolate products.

“We are a funny company,” says Henk Jan Beltman, chief chocolate officer at Tony’s Chocolonely.

“The reason that we are a company is not that we want to sell chocolate and not that we want to make money.” Instead, Beltman adds: “We want to make the world a nicer place.”

Tony’s Chocolonely is one of many companies dedicated to producing what’s known as Fair Trade chocolate by providing better prices to farmers and slave free working conditions.

Each bar is marketed with a promise to the consumer that no slave labor was used in the making of its chocolate.

It maintains that traceability is the key to achieving completely slave-free chocolate.

The cocoa sector, worth more than $100 billion per year, has long battled with poor labor practices and forms of exploitation.

A 2015 report from Tulane University and the U.S. Department of Labor found that more than two million children were working in what it defined as “hazardous” conditions in the cocoa industry in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.

According to the World Fair Trade Organization, one of the 10 guiding principles of the Fair Trade movement is to ensure good working conditions and ensure no forced labor has been used in the manufacture of any product.

Yet Tony’s Chocolonely believes the industry can further address this issue and that chocolate no longer needs to be a guilty pleasure.

Beltman says, “If you look at certification like the Rainforest Alliance or Fair Trade or UTZ, those are all good but they don’t manufacture a product … and as a product owner you feel responsibility and it’s your responsibility to sell something you can be proud of.

“Whether it’s fish or phones or chocolate bars, it’s always the owner who is responsible for the stuff that they sell … and a certification body is never going to take that responsibility away.”

Art of the chocolatier

Its recipe for slave free chocolate starts on its cocoa farms.

By focusing on the fine details of its supply chain, Tony’s Chocolonely says it traces the origin of the cocoa it buys – all the way from the beans purchased directly from its farm cooperatives in West Africa to the finished product.

Yet it hasn’t been working alone. Industry giant Barry Callebaut has become a strategic partner.

Learn more about modern slavery

At its factory in the town of Wieze, Belgium, Barry Callebaut has built a system that isolates Tony’s Chocolonely product.

Plant director, Xavier De Buysscher, says Tony’s Chocolonely beans are treated, roasted and segregated. Its liquid chocolate is stored into a separate tank.

Once this process is complete, the product is molded by Belgian chocolate masters, Althea, which stamps an ethical message into each bar.

The unequal shape of the end product reflects inequality in the world and outlines the West African countries that supply the beans.

This detail is in keeping with the Tony’s Chocolonely marketing strategy, to remind the consumer how and why the company began.

Life on the plantation

In 2003, Dutch journalists behind popular show “The Consumer Investigation Agency” exposed the trafficking of boys from Burkina Faso to the Ivory Coast, interviewing former slaves about life on the cocoa plantations.

The production team proposed to their audience that by eating chocolate all were complicit in slavery. After gathering testimonies from those who had been enslaved, reporter Teun Van De Keuken, unsuccessfully attempted to get himself arrested by the Dutch authorities to emphasize the point.

Three years later, determined to prove chocolate could be made slave-free, the journalists founded Tony’s Chocolonely.

Now run by an executive team, the original founders have left the company. But cocoa labor abuses remain in the headlines.

The 2015 Tulane University report said the number of child laborers in cocoa production in Ghana and the Ivory Coast had increased by 13% from the time the last study had been conducted five years before.

It also cited endemic poverty as a major reason trafficking and unethical labor practices flourish in the region.

Taste of success

According to Beltman, Tony’s Chocolonely operation has been hugely successful so far.

“We launched as a journalist initiative … but all of a sudden by sending out the message people were buying the product and talking about [it],” Beltman says.

Thousands forced to work on Brazil's cattle ranches,"Arapoema, Brazil (CNN) -- In this small town on the edge of Brazil's somewhat lawless agricultural frontier, streets turn to mud under tropical rains and laundry hangs limp in front of cement-box houses.

There's one bank and two churches. But for most folks here, if you want a job, you have to head to one of the nearby cattle ranches - only recently carved out of the steamy Amazon jungle.

Luiz Cardoso da Silva, a 69-year-old ranch hand, has worked on half a dozen. But he hopes to never go back.

""I want to spend more time here at home, maybe line up a little something close to my family. There would be nothing better than that,"" says Seu Luiz, as he is known.

On a recent Saturday, Seu Luiz and several of his children crowded into their kitchen for plates of rice, beans and fried liver. The women perched on rustic wooden chairs in the one-room house and the men squatted out back.

""Anybody who's been in the leopard's mouth is real happy right here,"" Seu Luiz said.

'Treated like animals'

Just three days earlier, Seu Luiz was sleeping on the floor of a cattle corral, surrounded by fetid mud.

He and six relatives had been living and working on the ranch for two years, building fences and weeding pastures. There was no bathroom, just a single outdoor spigot to shower and wash clothes and dishes. Nearby bushes served as a toilet.

JUST WATCHED Family forced to live with cattle on Brazilian ranch Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Family forced to live with cattle on Brazilian ranch 04:59

That's how they were found when an eight-car convoy, lights flashing, pulled into the ranch. One of the Brazilian mobile units tasked with cracking down on worker exploitation across the country was following up on a tip.

Marcelo Goncalves Campos, a veteran inspector for the Labor Ministry, shook his head as he took notes.

""I've been an inspector for almost 20 years and this is really one of the worst cases I've seen,"" he said. ""They are being treated, without any exaggeration, like animals. Sleeping in the same corral as the cattle.""

Seu Luiz tells inspectors that they haven't received any money for the last two years. He says the ranch owner provides them with food, deducts it from their wages and claims that they ended up owing him money.

""You can't leave because you owe money for the food he's given you, you have a debt."" He says he was afraid for the safety of his family if he left.

Debt bondage is common in Brazil's lawless cattle country, according to the coordinator of this latest operation, Andre Wagner, also from the Labor Ministry.

""You'll see someone working in degrading conditions, with an exhausting work schedule, eating one meal a day, while they don't receive any form of salary or a very small one, because their food and tools are discounted,"" he says.

An uphill fight

In fact, more than 50,000 workers have been rescued from what Brazil defines as slave-like conditions since the mobile units were created in 1995. A third of them came from ranches.

But it's an uphill fight with roughly 25,000 Brazilians lured into slavery every year, according to the Catholic Pastoral Land Commission, or CPT. They also end up working in coalmines, sugar cane fields, urban construction sites and garment factories.

Brazil's resources for fighting exploitation are limited. The number of mobile units - comprised of inspectors, prosecutors and federal police - has fallen to four from eight just a decade ago.

""Our method for fighting slavery is good, but we have very few inspectors,"" says Wagner. ""When the complaints are received at our headquarters in Brasilia, we can't go immediately. The delays mean the conditions might have changed.""

The delays are often five or six months, he says.

'Nobody deserves to live like this'

In the case of Seu Luiz, it's a recent tip - just two weeks old.

On the day the mobile unit shows up, the ranch owner is nowhere to be found and doesn't answer his phone. That makes it hard for them to secure an immediate payout for workers.

But the inspectors gather evidence that can be used in negotiations or an eventual trial, setting up an impromptu office on a patio at the ranch. They log hours of interviews and investigate the owner's assets.

Wagner says financial compensation averages about $2,000 for exploited workers but when the conditions are extreme, it can be 10 times that.

The first priority, however, is removing the family from the ranch.

Maria Dalva Sousa, 18, had been living with her husband and toddler son in a shack on the edge of the corral.

""I just want to get out of here, nobody deserves to live like this,"" she says. ""Look at this mud, only rats can sleep in a place like this.""

Together, they all roll up a couple of foam mattresses, stuff clothes into cardboard boxes and load a stove onto the back of a police pick-up truck. After two years of grinding work on the ranch, these are their few possessions of value.

The tiny bedroom where Maria Dalva Sousa slept with her husband and child.

Cattle country

In northern Brazil, cattle roam the rolling pastures.

Huge swaths of the Amazon rainforest were cut down to create these ranches. At first, farmers were encouraged by the government to settle the land. Then they seized more territory illegally.

The famous grass-fed beef produced on these ranches is a staple at home and an important export for Brazil, accounting for $4.35 billion in revenues in 2016.

Few consumers suspect that extreme labor exploitation is an ingrained part of this culture.

But Xavier Plassat, a French Dominican friar, has dedicated his life to fighting what he calls modern-day slavery in the region.

""The main point about slavery is that someone wants to make a profit with zero cost,"" he says. ""Here, more than anywhere, it is easy to make a profit with zero cost. You are on the frontier of farming, of ranching.""

JUST WATCHED Friar battles labor explotation in Brazil Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Friar battles labor explotation in Brazil 04:31

Plassat, 66, works with the Pastoral Land Commission, coordinating their national campaign against labor exploitation.

He has a network of agents and informants who talk to ranch-hands and send reports of labor abuses to federal authorities. Initially, their tips lead to about a quarter of the mobile unit raids.

This has gotten some of the church activists killed - most notably Dorothy Stang, the American-born nun who was shot and killed in 2005.

""I don't say we want to be martyrs,"" Plassat says. ""But we try to be present to share the suffering and help the workers.""

French Dominican friar Xavier Plassat.

'Impunity, greed, vulnerability, misery'

Plassat shows us a safe house run by the Pastoral Commission where workers who have been rescued by the mobile units can eat and sleep while they fight for compensation.

He says conditions have improved in the region, but says modern-day slavery is far from being eradicated.

""Slavery is a system and it has several roots: impunity, greed, vulnerability, misery. If you don't address all of it at the same time you will probably have the same persons coming back to the same cycle of enslavement,"" he says.

He is concerned that Brazil could actually be sliding backwards on the issue.

An increasingly powerful rural lobby in the national congress has pushed to relax the country's very broad definition of slave labor while the resources to fight it have shrunk.

One of the main tools used to shame employers into compliance has also been undermined - every year the Labor Ministry publishes a ""Dirty List"" of companies caught exploiting workers. But recently, its publication has been repeatedly blocked or delayed.

Return to slavery?

For Seu Luiz, good news finally comes. The ranch owner's family has agreed to pay the equivalent of $38,000 in back wages and penalties for pain and suffering - to be divided among the seven workers.

Seu Luiz says he'll use it to move out of the one-room house he rents and finally buy a home of his own. Something he hopes will protect his children in the future.

In the meantime, a federal prosecutor has filed criminal charges against the ranch owner. Those charges are currently being reviewed by a judge.

Andre Wagner, coordinator of the Ministry of Labor's Special Mobile Unit operation in Tocantins

For Wagner, the raid was a success. But he says you can never really be sure that you've saved someone.

""It's possible Sue Luiz won't return to these working conditions,"" he says. ""But it's also possible he will. Given his age and his limited professional qualifications, he will continue to be a potential victim of slave labor.""",2017-04-26 00:00:00
The children working in Cambodia's brick kilns,"They're learning at a first grade level. Neat rows of students read the local language, Khmer, out loud. The 16-year-old off to the side stands out. He's the only one in the uniformed group wearing long sleeves in the sweltering heat.

Phea Chantheng says he's afraid of the sight of his own hand. He doesn't even like to think about how the accident happened. At the Marist School for children with disabilities, outside Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, the teachers have seen this kind of injury before.

Usually the arms are amputated below the shoulder, sometimes below the elbow.

""It's an obscene accident. It happens more than once on the same machines in some places,"" says Brother Terry Heinrich, one of the founders of the religious school. He counts about 20 students who have come through his classroom in about as many years with the tell-tale sign of ""the accident.""

""They are pushing clay into a crusher, their hands are caught, dragged into the machine. Arms are crushed. They have to stand there while the machine is dismantled to get them out,"" says Heinrich.

Chantheng kept his arm but he was left with a mangled hand. He was working in a brick factory when his feet slipped out from under him and his hand got caught.

It happened two years ago, and 25 miles from the school a catholic mission helped get him into. The memory stings.

He was 14 at the time at the time of the accident; his mother says that since the age of 11 he had been pitching in at the brick factory where his mother worked, loading bricks onto a cart and hauling them off to dry.

When she can't work anymore, she says they'll be responsible for paying off the debt she owes to the owner of the factory where she works.

She says that 15 years ago she took a $12 loan from a brick factory owner that has ballooned to $2,800-worth of debt.

Over the years, she moved between different brick-making factories. Each time, she says, the new owner bought the debt she owed the previous owner. And then she'd owe a little bit more.

Like other brick kiln workers, she's paid by the brick. She says that much of her meager wages must go toward paying off the debt; there's barely any money to survive on. When there's not enough for necessities, she has to borrow more.

""This is the life of a brick kiln worker,"" she says.

To make more bricks, and earn more money, Mok Thy says it's typical for parents working at brick kilns to put their children to work alongside them.

At brick factories outside of Phnom Penh, CNN saw children involved in the brick-making process.

'A sense of hopelessness'

In 2016, A Cambodian NGO called LICADHO sent researchers to dozens of brick kilns outside of Phnom Penh after being contacted by a group of families whose children were injured in accidents similar to Chantheng's.

""Often there's a sense of guilt [for the families and the children], there's a sense of hopelessness, there's depression, there's bullying by other kids and parents and other people who don't understand -- and there's lifetime pain depending on where the injury is,"" says Naly Pilorge, the deputy director of advocacy for LICADHO.

In December 2016, LICADHO published a report determining that the risk of injuries to children in the kilns remains high. The same report alleges widespread abuses including child labor and bonded labor in the brick factories that are doing big business, fueling Cambodia's building boom. The US State Department considers bonded labor to be a form of modern slavery.

Cambodia's Labor Ministry refutes the findings of the LICADHO report. Child labor and bonded labor are illegal under Cambodian law.

The law isn't being enforced, according to Pilorge. ""[entire families] are just working. Working nonstop. Whatever money they get barely covers their food. It doesn't make any difference towards reduction of their debt.

""What we found is not only that children were working besides dangerous machinery but we were also finding out that entire families were coerced or forced or tricked into bonded labor.""

CNN visited brick kilns where workers said their debt to factory owners ranged from hundreds to thousands of US dollars. The going rate per brick is a fraction of a cent according to LICADHO. The equation makes it impossible for workers to pay down debt while earning enough for basics.

But the Labor Ministry insists the illegal practice of debt bondage isn't flourishing in the kilns as LICADHO claims; in fact, the Ministry says the practice doesn't exist at all.

""Debt bondage is the direct debt between employer and workers. This is debt borrowing,"" insists Veng Heang, director of the Labor Ministry's Child Labor Department.

Veng calls it a legal system of advance loans, but he says the distinction from debt bondage is ""confusing"" and for that reason, the practice should stop. One brick kiln owner we spoke to on the outskirts on Phnom Penh told us all her workers owe her money, because she gives them advance loans for things like weddings and to cover the expense of births.

""Their lives here are good because the bills are put on me,"" she says. ""When they give birth, we pay; when they get married, we also pay. So their debts increase because they borrow our money.""

Veng also says a successful government campaign against child labor has wiped out the problem in the kilns entirely. The success, he says, started with a campaign to get children out of the kilns launched back in 2006.

Six hundred government employees are assigned to inspect nearly 400 brick kilns. The Labor Ministry says they haven't identified a single case that qualifies as child labor since 2012.

Children in the kilns

During the week that a CNN crew spent filming at brick factories outside of Phnom Penh, we saw children involved with various steps of the brick-making process, in every factory we visited. We can't verify the ages of some of the children, or if the type of work they were doing would be considered illegal.

All the children we met said they were helping out their families without being paid.

The Labor Ministry responded by saying that workers may be older than they look and that while labor is illegal for children under 15, light work is allowed for children aged 12 and over.

That's not the kind of work Chantheng was doing two years ago. His mother no longer works on the machine that scarred her son. She's moved on to another kiln where she spends her days hauling carts weighed down with bricks.",2017-07-26 00:00:00

Story highlights In 2013, CNN reported on child sex trafficking in Cambodia CNN returns to the village of Svay Pak, a child trafficking hot spot

(CNN) —

Sephak was aged just 13 years old when she was sold for sex by her mother.

She was taken to a hospital, issued a certificate confirming her virginity, and then taken to a hotel room where a she was raped for days. She was returned home after three nights.

Sephak grew up in Svay Pak, a poor fishing village on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. It’s a community that has become notorious as a place to buy child sex.

Her mother, Ann, said her family had fallen on hard times and that they took out a loan that eventually spiraled to about $6,000 in debt. With money-lenders threatening her, Ann took up an offer from a woman who approached her promising big money for her daughter’s virginity.

Sephak said her mother was paid $800. But after Sephak’s return, her mother began pressuring her to work in a brothel.

Ann said she regrets her decision and that if she had known then what she knows now, she would never have sold her daughter.

Return to the epicenter

The CNN Freedom Project first spoke with Sephak in 2013, along with other child trafficking victims, as part of a documentary on sex trafficking in Cambodia.

Sephak was rescued from her former life by anti-trafficking non-profit Agape International Missions (AIM). Now a woman, she works alongside other survivors in a factory run by AIM, earning money making bracelets and clothing.

“Today, I feel more much stability than before. Not a lot of stability, but enough,” says Sephak. “Now I have a decent job. I really want other people to have the kind of work that I have.”

More from the CNN Freedom Project

American Don Brewster founded AIM in 2005 to fight child trafficking in Cambodia. A former pastor, he says the organization has so far rescued more than 700 people.

Most of his efforts are focused in Svay Pak. It’s a place where the poverty is overwhelming, with many families scraping by on less than a dollar a day. The residents are mostly undocumented Vietnamese migrants, many of whom live in ramshackle houseboats on the Tonle Sap River, eking out a living farming fish.

“When we talk about child sex trafficking, this was at one point the epicenter,” says Brewster.

“We would say when we came [to Svay Pak] it was 100% – if you were a girl born here, you were going to be trafficked. We would say today it’s significantly below 50%.”

But Brewster has warned that although children are no longer being sold in brothels here, trafficking is now taking place in hotels, where it is harder to detect, and harder to prevent.

The US Department of State’s 2017 Trafficking in Person’s report says Cambodia does not fully meet minimum standards for eliminating trafficking, but notes that the Cambodian government has made significant efforts to fight human trafficking, including increasing the number of trafficking convictions.

’Sometimes there’s no choice’

As AIM’s director of investigations, Eric Meldrum works alongside Cambodian police to track down criminals and rescue victims. He says that in three years, he has helped rescue 130 girls in more than 50 different raids and that AIM’s partnership with police has been crucial.

“The police are doing a good job,” he says. “We’ve got a very good cooperation with them and there’s a definite willingness throughout the police, throughout the hierarchy of the police, to crack down on the issue.”

Meldrum adds: “This is still a poor country and people are still looking to get money and unfortunately, with a lack of education, lack of jobs, the sex industry is one of the routes that people can make money to send home.

“Even sometimes families don’t want their daughters or girls in the industry, sometimes there’s no choice.”

In spite of the efforts of NGOs and police, that’s a reality still faced by many girls in Svay Pak.

“It’s hard to understand why these mothers do this,” says Sephak. “They don’t have money, so they make their daughters work.

“Even now, I see a lot of mothers who don’t understand the feelings of their daughters. They don’t understand that their daughters have hearts, that they suffer.”

City of Tomorrow,"About this project

The city of tomorrow might already be here.

Right now, 21st century challenges like greenhouse gases, crime and high energy costs — are being met worldwide with real innovation.

In the coming years communities will grow at an amazing pace. The United Nations predicts by 2030, 60% of the world will live in cities. Demand for clean air, water, energy — and convenience — will skyrocket.

Along with emerging innovations, increased connectivity via the Internet and smart devices promises to help solve many of these threats.

Imagine turning the ocean into drinking water, ending traffic jams, making policing smarter and creating buildings with zero carbon footprints.

The conversation is happening now at #CityofTomorrow on @CNN and https://www.facebook.com/cnn.",
The CNN 10: Healthiest cities,"Copenhagen is a bustling city full of ambitious professionals and young families. Yet working long hours here is frowned upon.

Just 2% of employees in Copenhagen work 40 hours a week or more, according to an OECD report, freeing them up to spend time with family, join organized sports, volunteer or participate in other community programs.

The cost to participate in those programs, which range from laughter yoga in the park to basket weaving? Free. This helps encourage residents to get involved.

Their ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down, it gives them a happiness boost. Studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed. That’s one reason Denmark takes the top spot as the happiest nation in the annual World Happiness Report commissioned by the United Nations.

Other things play into Copenhagen's relaxed atmosphere. Residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries. There are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city.

Men cycle to work in their slim-fit suits, and women don’t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels. The city has 249 miles of bike paths, which makes biking an easy and safe option. And people use them: Nearly half of commuters in Copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day.

Though parks and bike paths are plentiful, the government is upping its efforts. By 2015, all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than 15 minutes, according to a new official municipal policy. Many of the new parks created will be “pocket parks,” or small green spaces for city residents. The hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution.

Here’s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for Denmark: Ninety-six percent of residents in Copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need.

This supportive society is just another reason Copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest (and happiest) cities.",
"Fully vaccinated people can travel at low risk to themselves, new CDC guidance says","(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday released a highly anticipated update to travel guidance for people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, eliminating some testing and quarantine recommendations.

Fully vaccinated people can travel at low risk to themselves, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Friday, but travel still isn't recommended at this time because of rising numbers of coronavirus cases.

The agency said that as long as coronavirus precautions are taken, including mask wearing, fully vaccinated people can travel within the United States without getting tested for Covid-19 before or self-quarantining after.

For international travel, fully vaccinated people don't need a Covid-19 test prior to travel -- unless it is required by the destination -- and do not need to self-quarantine after returning to the United States. They should still have a negative Covid-19 test before boarding a flight to the US, and a follow up test three to five days after their return, the CDC noted.

The CDC considers someone fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the last required dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The updated guidance does not apply to unvaccinated people. The CDC advises anyone who hasn't been fully vaccinated to continue to avoid travel.

Pfizer/BioNTech says its Covid-19 vaccine is 100% effective and well tolerated in adolescents,"(CNN) Clinical trial results of Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine showed its efficacy is 100% and it is well tolerated in youths ages 12 to 15, the companies said Wednesday.

Pfizer/BioNTech plan to submit the data to the US Food and Drug Administration as soon as possible for expanded emergency use authorization of the two-dose vaccine.

In a Phase 3 trial of 2,260 participants ages 12 to 15 in the US, the vaccine elicited strong antibody responses one month after the second dose -- exceeding those demonstrated in people ages 16 to 25 in previous trials, Pfizer reported. The vaccine is currently authorized in the US for emergency use in people 16 and older.

Researchers observed 18 Covid-19 cases among the 1,129 participants who were given a placebo, and none among the 1,131 volunteers who got the vaccine. The data has yet to be peer reviewed.

Pfizer/BioNTech added that the side effects seen in the young teens were similar to those seen among 16 to 25-year-olds. Common side effects include pain at the injection site, fatigue and fever. The participants will be monitored for protection and safety for two years after their second dose.

Manufacturing moonshot: How Pfizer makes its millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses,"(CNN) When the coronavirus pandemic began, the challenge for Pfizer and BioNTech wasn't just developing a Covid-19 vaccine -- they also had to make it, and by the hundreds of millions.

This was no small feat. Until the very end of last year, no mRNA vaccine had ever been authorized and no such vaccine had ever been manufactured to scale by any company.

Pfizer has now shipped more than 100 million doses to the US and it said this week it has successfully met its goal of 120 million doses released and ready for shipment by the end of March.

For Mike McDermott, Pfizer's president of global supply, the mission is still more doses. Billions of them.

""Our goal has been running 24/7, make as many doses as possible. I actually don't even have a production goal,"" McDermott told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta during an exclusive tour of its manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in March. ""Our goal is to produce as much as possible to get to 2 billion doses this year as soon as possible.""

Pfizer/BioNTech's global goal is 2.5 billion doses by the end of the year.

Mike McDermott, Pfizer's president of global supply, left, and CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta inside Pfizer's Kalamazoo, Michigan, manufacturing facility.

Big gamble

Pfizer met its first milestones with substantial upfront investment, and it had no guarantees.

Pfizer was part of Operation Warp Speed as a potential supplier for Covid-19 vaccines and had a purchase agreement for an initial 100 million doses. However, the company didn't receive federal funding for the research or development of the vaccine.

So while Pfizer could repurpose some of its equipment at its main manufacturing site in Kalamazoo, most of what's there now didn't exist a year ago.

""Pfizer has spent at risk, almost $2 billion on the overall program. From manufacturing, my team spent $500 million, before we even got out of clinical trials. So all completely at risk. We didn't know if we had a product that was going to work,"" said McDermott.

Before Pfizer decided on its final vaccine candidate, it was looking into four different options. That meant McDermott and his team had to be ready to go in any direction.

""I think about like, we're going to have dinner tonight, and we need to get dessert ready, but I don't know what dessert we're having. So you just start buying ingredients,"" he said. ""Maybe we're making a cake, maybe we're making brownies. Let's bring in the standard materials that we need. So filling up this pantry was quite, quite expensive.""

Pfizer's global goal is 2.5 billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the year.

One of the biggest rate-limiting steps of this production, according to McDermott, has been the availability of raw materials and specifically lipids, the fatty substance that safely houses the mRNA until it can get to our cells.

""Lipid nanoparticle hasn't been used in a large commercial product. So the lipid suppliers weren't very large. And so we work very closely with them to build more lipids capacity, and actually making lipids in this site in Kalamazoo, Michigan,"" said McDermott.

The heart of mRNA

Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine can simply be described as mRNA housed in a lipid coating, but the successful production of that by the millions all came down to a something the size of a quarter.

""

The heart of this whole machine is what's called an impingement jet mixer,"" said McDermott as he is twirled it around his fingers.

The impingement jet mixer, also known as the tea stirrer, works by simply pumping lipids in one side and mRNA in the other, forcing them together with 400 pounds of pressure. That's what creates the lipid nanoparticle which is essentially the vaccine.

These aren't just any lipids, Pfizer/BioNTech had to design the right combination of four different lipids that would not only protect the mRNA on the way to cells, but then release the mRNA once it gets there.

While the process of creating lipid nanoparticles is not new, McDermott said the challenge was scaling up this process.

""The first time somebody showed me this impingement jet mixer, I said, 'You can't be serious?' Like how could you put billions of doses through here? So my confidence level was actually quite low. Not that it could be done, I knew it worked at this scale, but how could you multiply it?""

Pfizer's Kalamazoo facility is trying to operate 24/7 to make ""as many doses as possible.""

McDermott's first thought was to go bigger, make a large-scale tea stirrer to allow more volume to pass through. When that didn't work, they ended up replicating the quarter-sized mixers and put technology in place to ensure efficiency in order to scale up production.

""There's a computer system that's running the whole apparatus that makes sure you have the precise amount of flow and pressure. And that allowed us to get more production out. Even though this size is small, we were able to really scale this up our original design for this machine. We're currently operating at four times the capacity.""

Make it modular

Part of what has allowed Pfizer to continue to make room for these new formulation suites has been its strategy of using prefabricated construction.

In its 1,300-acre foot Kalamazoo facility, Pfizer is installing around 13,000 square feet of modular rooms that are first built in Texas and then shipped to Kalamazoo.

""We've had planned to expand our formulation capacity. The question was, how can we do it quickly? If we built it wall by wall on site, it would have taken us a year. By doing it modularly, we could cut that in half,"" says McDermott.

Moving each room into place is surprisingly easy. With the help of compressed air -- think of an air hockey table -- you can simply slide them into place. Then the rooms are ready to be connected to electricity, sterilized and put to use.

With each of these improvements, Pfizer says it has gone from producing 3 to 4 million doses of vaccine a week to 13 million doses a week. They company expects to double that again by the middle of the year. That will mean roughly 100 million doses a month and the ability to hit its goal of 300 million total doses delivered to the US government by July.

What's next

McDermott says the last 12 months have been ""like nothing I've ever experienced in my career.""

""As a kid, my dad worked for NASA,"" McDermott said. ""He was lucky enough to be in mission control in Houston when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon right at that amazing moment.

""I could never imagine having a moment like that in my life. Right? Like, what's the odds that something like that would ever happen again?""

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Then came December 13, 2020 -- the day the United States' first coronavirus vaccine, the first step to end the pandemic, left the facility.

""The day we shipped the first doses out of this site, it rushed over me like that was that was my moment,"" McDermott said. ""That was our moonshot.""

But McDermott says vaccine supply is always on his mind, and they have to prepare for the future -- and that means coronavirus variants.

Although there is no evidence people immunized with Pfizer's vaccine will be less protected against the current variants, the company has started testing a third dose of its current vaccine.

Pfizer and BioNTech say they are also in ongoing discussions with regulators about potentially testing a vaccine modified to protect against concerning variants in a Phase 1/2 study.

The company's next giant leap is to be ready to get it to patients, if necessary.

Pfizer's goal, McDermott says: To be able to develop a new variant-specific vaccine, get it through production and get it to patients within a matter of months.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
"Lab leak Covid-19 theory is like something out of a comic book, virologist says","(CNN) Theories about a laboratory leak being the source of the coronavirus pandemic sound like something out of a comic book, one virologist says.

Dr. Robert Garry of Tulane University and other virologists have been publishing studies for a year that demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 originated naturally in animals and is unlikely to have been engineered in a lab.

Genetic study shows the virus carries all the messy hallmarks of nature and none of the fingerprints that would have been left behind by laboratory manipulation.

""What are the things that argue against a lab leak? There are a whole lot of them,"" Garry told CNN.

Yet last week, former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield added his voice to those saying the virus most likely leaked from a laboratory in China -- perhaps by accident.

""I am of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory, escaped,"" Redfield told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

JUST WATCHED Former CDC director believes virus came from lab in China Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former CDC director believes virus came from lab in China 05:30

Redfield, a virologist, presented no evidence to back up his assertion. And while he joins non-experts such as US Sen. Tom Cotton and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his former colleague Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, disagrees, as do a swath of other experts in infectious diseases.

And a World Health Organization report released Tuesday says the lab leak theory is the least likely of four scenarios its investigators considered. Most likely: the virus spread from its natural host, probably a bat, to another animal and then to people.

But the US government criticized the report as incomplete, further feeding Redfield's theory. And WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he did not think the WHO team's lab assessment was extensive enough. ""Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions,"" Tedros told a briefing Tuesday.

""Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy.""

What bothers most scientists CNN spoke to was Redfield's description of what he says he thinks happened.

""Most of us in a lab, when trying to grow a virus, we try to help make it grow better, and better, and better, and better, and better, and better so we can do experiments and figure out about it. That's the way I put it together,"" Redfield said.

""That's the way it would be in a movie or some sort of a thriller or a comic book,"" retorts Garry, who studies viruses in the field and in the lab and who helped write a study published in March of last year that showed the virus arose naturally.

""It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus,"" Kristian Andersen, an infectious disease researcher at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, along with Garry and other experts, reported in Nature Medicine in March 2020.

They found the receptor binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein -- that's the structure that attaches the virus to human cells -- ""is not ideal."" It could have been better designed, they found. ""This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation,"" they wrote.

They also looked for evidence that a process called reverse genetics had been used to alter an existing virus to make it look more like SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes Covid-19. But they found ""irrefutably"" that was not done.

""There's just a lot of things about it that look perfectly natural,"" Garry said. ""It's just messy enough to look natural.""

Joel Wertheim, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California San Diego who has studied the coronavirus, says much the same thing.

""There is nothing about this virus's genome that wouldn't come about in nature,"" Wertheim told CNN.

""No one has shown the selective patterns consistent with laboratory passage or the interaction of genetic material that is impossible to find in nature.""

Wertheim and colleagues wrote a study published earlier this month that shows the virus could not have been circulating for much more than a month or two before it caused the December 2019 epidemic in Wuhan. And their study found the virus wasn't particularly well suited to cause a pandemic, although it has since evolved into variants that do spread more easily among humans.

""Since then we have seen a plethora of adaptive mutations arise almost throughout the world,"" Wertheim said.

Both findings tend to support the WHO report's conclusions.

The closest relative yet found to SARS-Cov-2 is one called RaTG13, which is found in bats. A type of anteater called a pangolin can also be infected with a similar virus.

""The Fox News version of this story is that someone took RaTG13 plus a pangolin virus and they mixed that together in a lab and somehow achieved four to five decades of evolution,"" Garry scoffed.

""That's a really magical thinking kind of scenario. That might happen in a Marvel comic book but that is not going to happen in real life.""

What probably happened in real life, the academic studies and the WHO investigation both found, is what happened with the first SARS -- severe acute respiratory syndrome -- in 2002-2004. A wild animal slaughtered for food carried a virus that had evolved in such a way that it could infect humans, too.

""You have animals that were brought into these markets,"" Garry said.

""Or it could have been a person carrying it to the markets. It's how SARS 1 happened and it's no doubt how SARS 2 happened.""

Angela Rasmussen of Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security agrees.

Many of the lab-leak theories come from people who know a little about so-called gain-of-function research -- work done on viruses to make them grow better, as Redfield talked about -- or to make them more infectious or more virulent.

""Gain-of-function research is also subject to intense scrutiny and governmental oversight, precisely because of the high risk involved in conducting it safely; thus, it is extremely unlikely that gain-of-function research on hard-to-obtain coronaviruses (such as bat SARS-like coronaviruses) could occur under the radar,"" Rasmussen wrote in January in Nature Medicine.

Plus, nature does this very well on its own, with the emergence of viruses such as influenza, SARS, coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS, which appears to have evolved from a bat virus to infect camels and, occasionally, people.

""Unfortunately, this did little to quell often contradictory and sometimes outright ridiculous conspiracy theories that spread faster than the virus itself: SARS-CoV-2 was the result of a laboratory accident or was intentionally engineered, and this was concealed to hide either spectacular incompetence or a complex international conspiracy involving Bill Gates, the Chinese Communist Party and 5G wireless network infrastructure with an end goal of ushering in a new world order,"" Rasmussen wrote.

""The proof presented to corroborate these theories relied heavily on cherry-picked evidence ranging from withdrawn preprints to secret diplomatic cables about vague lab safety information to grossly overinterpreted satellite and mobile phone data, all of which prove exactly nothing about SARS-CoV-2 origins.""",2021-03-31 00:00:00

"Experts predicted the UK variant would become dominant in the US by March. So, is it?","(CNN) Mounting evidence suggests the more contagious coronavirus variant first identified in the UK, which experts believe is partly driving an uptick of cases in places like Michigan, may already be dominant across the US.

""I think we are there,"" said William Lee, vice president of science at Helix, a company whose tests have identified a large share of variant cases across the country. ""But at the end of the day, it's hard to say for sure,"" given gaps and delays in the data.

Lee is one of the authors of a study published Tuesday in the journal Cell estimating that the variant, known as B.1.1.7, would cause the majority of Covid-19 cases in the US by March 19.

According to that study, B.1.1.7 cases are expected to double every week and a half as a percentage of the country's total coronavirus cases. The study also concluded the variant was introduced several different times to the US, as early as late November. The study's conclusions were based on testing data through February.

Lee said that there's strong evidence the variant is already responsible for a majority of cases in states like Florida, Michigan and Georgia -- with a number of others close on their heels, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Texas and Southern California. However, Helix's data do not include robust samples from a number of other states, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions.
