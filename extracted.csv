America Has Long Favored Cars Over Trains and Buses. Can Biden Change That?,"Flooded streets after Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas, Aug. 29, 2017. (Ilana Panich-Linsman/The New York Times)

WASHINGTON — If America is dominated by car culture and the call of the open road, there is a big reason for that: Over the past 65 years, the United States has spent nearly $10 trillion in public funds on highways and roads and just one-quarter of that on subways, buses and passenger rail.

But President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan, unveiled this week, represents one of the most ambitious efforts yet to challenge the centrality of the automobile in American life, by proposing to tilt federal spending far more toward public transportation and coax more people out of their cars. Experts say that transformation is necessary to tackle climate change but could prove extremely difficult in practice.

As part of his plan, Biden wants to spend $85 billion over eight years to help cities modernize and expand their mass transit systems, in effect doubling federal spending on public transportation each year. There is also $80 billion to upgrade and extend intercity rail networks such as Amtrak. That would be one of the largest investments in passenger trains in decades.

And while Biden’s plan offers $115 billion for roads, the emphasis would be on fixing aging highways and bridges rather than expanding the road network. That, too, is a shift in priorities: In recent years, states have spent roughly half their highway money building new roads or widening existing ones — which, studies have found, often just encourages more driving and does little to alleviate congestion.

“There’s no question that the share of funding going toward transit and rail in Biden’s proposal is vastly larger than in any similar legislation we’ve seen in our lifetime,” said Yonah Freemark, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. “It’s a dramatic shift.”

When Congress writes new multibillion-dollar transportation bills every few years, typically about four-fifths of the money goes to highways and roads, a pattern that has held since the early 1980s. To many, that disparity makes sense. After all, roughly 80% of trips Americans take are by car or light truck, with just 3% by mass transit.

But some experts say this gets the causality backward: Decades of government investment in roads and highways — starting with the creation of the interstate highway system in 1956 — have transformed most cities and suburbs into sprawling, car-centered environments where it can be dangerous to walk or bike. In addition to that, other reliable transit options are scarce.

“We’re almost forcing everyone to drive,” said Catherine Ross, an expert on transportation planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “The choices that individuals make are deeply shaped by the infrastructure that we have built.”

Transportation now accounts for one-third of America’s planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, with most of that from hundreds of millions of gasoline-burning cars and SUVs. And while Biden is proposing $174 billion to promote cleaner electric vehicles, experts have said that helping Americans drive less will be crucial to meeting the administration’s climate goals.

“Far too many Americans lack access to affordable public transit, and those who do have access are often met with delays and disruptions,” Biden said Wednesday. “We have the power to change that.”

But Biden, a longtime Amtrak rider and proponent, will face hurdles in trying to make the United States more train- and bus-friendly.

His plan still needs to get through Congress, where lawmakers in rural and suburban districts often prefer money for roads. Nationwide, new transit projects have been plagued by soaring costs. The coronavirus pandemic has also led many Americans to avoid subways and buses in favor of private vehicles, and it remains unclear when or whether transit ridership will bounce back.

The Biden administration may also have limited ability to sway the actions of state and local governments, which still account for the vast majority of transportation spending. Many key urban planning decisions — such as whether to build dense housing near light-rail stations — are made locally, and they can determine whether transit systems thrive or struggle.

“States are the emperors of transportation,” said Beth Osborne, director of Transportation for America, a transit advocacy group. “But so much of the culture of our current program is based on what has come out of the Department of Transportation, so it’s an important statement if the Biden administration is saying it’s time to pivot.”

Analysts cautioned that the White House still has not revealed key details of the plan. Its effectiveness may hinge on how the proposal gets integrated with transportation bills currently being worked on in Congress, which could adjust the balance of funding between highways and transit or impose conditions on how states can use federal funding.

Still, some transit agencies say a large infusion of federal money could be transformative. Many urban transit systems are more than a half-century old and struggle to secure enough funding to address their growing backlog of needed repairs. That typically leaves little money left over to consider major new expansions.

In Philadelphia, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority needs federal aid to move forward on a $2 billion plan to extend rail service to King of Prussia, a fast-growing job center, as well as a $1.8 billion plan to modernize the city’s aging trolleys, said Andrew Busch, a spokesperson for the agency.

In the Bay Area, federal funding would be necessary to extend the Bay Area Rapid Transit light-rail system to San Jose, California, and create a regional network of carpooling lanes, said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs at the region’s Metropolitan Transportation Commission.

Biden has also proposed spending $80 billion to upgrade and expand intercity rail service such as Amtrak. Right now the busiest Amtrak route is the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Boston, which Amtrak says needs $38 billion for upgrades and repairs.

Other cities have infrequent and often inconvenient connections. For instance, to travel from Cincinnati to Chicago by rail, there is just one train per day. The trip takes nine hours, and the train departs at 1:41 a.m.

Amtrak has suggested that, with $25 billion, it could greatly expand its network by 2035, adding 30 routes to cities currently unserved by intercity rail, like Las Vegas and Nashville, Tennessee, and improve service along 20 routes to cities like Houston and Cincinnati. Amtrak claimed that annual ridership would increase from 32 million today to 52 million, cutting greenhouse gas emissions by displacing car and air travel.

Yet attempts to expand U.S. transit and rail systems may run into pitfalls.

Building infrastructure in the United States has become notoriously expensive and difficult compared with other countries. In California, a plan for high-speed rail between Los Angeles and San Francisco that received federal funding from the Obama administration has struggled with repeated delays and cost overruns, and it remains unclear whether even a partial segment will be finished before 2030. The Biden proposal mentions this cost problem but is vague on ideas for how to fix it.

Another challenge will be ensuring that funding goes to the most effective projects. “When a lot of money is raining down from the top, states and localities will do whatever they can to get that money,” said Paul Lewis, vice president for policy and finance at the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan research center in Washington. “Sometimes that money may go to projects that aren’t the best projects.”

Lewis noted that improving the nation’s transportation system is not always a question of laying down new cement and steel. Often, the most effective changes may be operational, such as charging people more to drive during rush hour to alleviate congestion, lowering speed limits to improve traffic safety or increasing the frequency of bus routes to make them more useful to riders.

Some experts have also questioned whether the Biden administration will try to rein in local governments’ preference for major highway expansion projects that, critics say, continue to deepen the nation’s reliance on automobiles.

The administration has signaled a more skeptical stance toward highways. On Thursday, the Federal Highway Administration took the unusual step of pausing a planned expansion of Interstate 45 near Houston, amid concerns over increased air pollution and the displacement of Black and Hispanic communities. Separately, the Biden administration’s infrastructure proposal includes $20 billion to improve road safety, including for pedestrians, as well as another $20 billion to “reconnect neighborhoods” that were harmed by past highway projects.

But it remains to be seen how these programs will work. For instance, without strict conditions from the federal government, some states could simply take federal money intended for road repair and safety and then use their own state funds for further highway expansion.

“If this money isn’t accompanied by real policy changes,” said Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the Center for American Progress, “then states will just keep doing what they’ve always done, which isn’t equitable or green.”

Trump Isn’t Coming to Matt Gaetz’s Rescue—for Now,"The New York Times

NEW YORK — The Rev. Henry Torres told his parishioners, who had gathered on Palm Sunday in socially distanced rows of half-empty pews, that God had not abandoned them. The virus had killed dozens of regulars at the church, St. Sebastian Roman Catholic Church in Queens, and the pandemic forced it to close its doors for months last year. But the parishioners were there now, he said, which was a sign of hope. “Even through difficulties, God is at work,” Torres said. “Even when people are suffering, even if it may seem that God is silent, that does not mean that God is absent.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times That is a message that many Christians — and the cash-strapped churches that minister to them — are eager to believe this Easter, as the springtime celebration of hope and renewal on Sunday coincides with rising vaccination rates and the promise of a return to something resembling normal life. Religious services during the Holy Week holidays, which began on Palm Sunday and end on Easter, are among the most well-attended of the year, and this year they offer churches a chance to begin rebuilding their flocks and regaining their financial health. But the question of whether people will return is a crucial one. Across the city, many churches have still not reopened despite state rules that would allow them to do so. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, a nationally prominent Black church, said concerns over the coronavirus, and its disproportionate impact on the Black community, would keep his church from reopening until at least the fall. Nicholas Richardson, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, said many of its churches had also not reopened. When the diocese introduced a program last fall to allow its 190 parishes to pay a reduced tithe to the diocese, roughly half of them applied. “It varies church by church,” he said. “Pledges are not necessarily dramatically down, but donations given to the collection plate are hopelessly down.” The Rev. Patrick J. West, the pastor at St. Sebastian, said he and other priests have fretted over the return of parishioners when they gather for meals. Parishioners still fear the virus, which has killed tens of thousands of New Yorkers, and many have become accustomed to watching Mass online from the comforts of home, he said. “The word I use is ‘repatriate,’” he said. “How are we going to repatriate people back to the church? I don’t think it’s a matter of people’s faith, it’s a matter of health and safety. They need to be convinced that it is safe to worship in a congregation again, and I think that is absolutely right.” The hardships of the pandemic have been keenly felt at St. Sebastian, a bustling parish that offers Mass in English, Spanish and Tagalog inside a soaring, windowless space that was once a Loews movie theater. It sits on a busy intersection in the shadow of elevated subway tracks in Woodside, a working class but quickly gentrifying part of Queens where roughly 10% of the residents have been infected by the coronavirus, according to city data. “A lot of people have died,” said Micky Torres, a Filipino immigrant and longtime parishioner. A close friend of his from the parish died of COVID-19 in the first weeks of the pandemic, he said. It was his first of several Zoom funerals. “It was very sad and very weird.” At least 50 active parishioners at St. Sebastian have died of COVID-19, many in the early days of the pandemic when holding a funeral was impossible because the church was closed, said West. He began his assignment in the parish, which was founded in 1894 and moved into the former theater in 1954, shortly after churches were allowed to reopen at the end of June. The death rate in Woodside is higher than in the city as a whole, according to city data. “When I first got here it was memorial Mass after memorial Mass after memorial Mass,” he said. “We were having seven a week, plus funeral Masses for the people who were dying at that same time. We are still doing memorial Masses a year later.” St. Sebastian would normally welcome as many as 5,000 worshippers before the pandemic across several Masses on Saturdays and Sundays, said West. But pandemic rules limit its capacity to 50% and require social distancing. A good weekend now would draw roughly 1,200 people, less than a quarter of the pre-pandemic crowd, the pastor said. He said he hoped attendance at Easter would be robust, but there was no way to know for sure. The parish has adjusted in other ways, too. Masks and social distancing are required; hand sanitizer is readily available. Parishioners have also replaced the sign of peace, traditionally a handshake, with a nod or a wave. Churches were closed for 15 weeks during the first months of the pandemic last year, which included Holy Week. Even after they reopened at 25% capacity, many parishioners stayed away. That deprived parishes of both the people whose physical presence wills the community into existence, and the donations they make each week that help pay the bills. The resulting turmoil has wreaked havoc on the finances of churches across the New York region and the country, including icons like St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan and more humble houses of worship like St. Sebastian. All depend heavily on weekly donations to pay their expenses, which include utilities, staff salaries and an 8% tax paid to the local diocese. “We are hurting,” said West, who estimated the parish’s income had gone down 35% during the pandemic. The shortfall had forced him to keep the parish center closed, to lay off staff members in the parish office and even to ask the Diocese of Brooklyn to transfer one priest away from St. Sebastian. “We have a large immigrant population, and people are not used to using electronic payments or even writing checks,” said West. “If they are not physically here to donate cash, then we don’t physically get the donation.” Many Christians attend in-person services only on Christmas and Easter. Donations given on those two holidays make up 10% of the annual collection for most Catholic parishes, said Matthew Manion, the director for the Center for Church Management at Villanova University. He researched church finances during the pandemic and found steep income declines in parishes of all sizes. Based on figures from last year, he projects a 20% to 25% decline in the 2021 fiscal year, which may be exacerbated if people keep watching Mass online instead of in person. “The big questions are, Will Catholics who practice their faith frequently come back? And Catholics who practice their faith less frequently, are they gone for good?” said Manion. “Both of those answers could have big impacts, spiritually and financially.” He added: “Easter will be an interesting experiment. The spring will tell us a lot about what fiscal year 2022 and beyond will look like.” The mood was wary but hopeful at St. Sebastian on Palm Sunday, where street vendors sold woven palm fronds outside in the rain and a group of parishioners stood in the church foyer to listen to Mass, despite the audible rush and rattle of the elevated subway passing outside. Fewer than half the seats were filled at the morning’s English Mass, but a Spanish service later in the day was so well attended that worshippers were sent to the auditorium of the parish school so they could watch it on livestream while still obeying social distancing rules. Manuel Gil, a Peruvian immigrant who has worshipped at St. Sebastian for 25 years, said he thought the aftermath of the pandemic might actually bring more people to church, not fewer. “The important thing is that people have faith,” he said. “I think more people will come after the pandemic, because people whose families or friends have passed away will be looking for God. People’s lives have changed.” Speaking from the pulpit, Henry Torres urged parishioners to see the empty pews all around them as not just a manifestation of pandemic-era rules, but as vacant seats that might have been filled by those who died in the last year. But they should not dwell in sadness, he told the flock. Instead, they should celebrate the fact that they have survived. “You and I have been privileged and given an opportunity,” he said. “An hour from now is not promised. Tomorrow is not promised. All we have is right here and right now. Let us work right here and right now on our intimacy with God.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",

For instance, without strict conditions from the federal government, some states could simply take federal money intended for road repair and safety and then use their own state funds for further highway expansion. “If this money isn’t accompanied by real policy changes,” said Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the Center for American Progress, “then states will just keep doing what they’ve always done, which isn’t equitable or green.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
Army investigating Oklahoma training instructors in alleged sexual assaults,"The U.S. Army is investigating multiple military instructors at Fort Sill in Oklahoma after a female trainee came forward to allege they had sexually assaulted her.

The Army confirmed the investigation Thursday, saying in a statement that the training cadre members, ""presumed innocent,"" were suspended as the investigation proceeds.

Special agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command were investigating the allegations. The woman was not identified.

""A trainee raised allegations she was sexually assaulted by Cadre members,"" Maj. Gen. Kenneth L. Kamper, commanding general of the base's Fires Center of Excellence training center, said during a teleconference Thursday.

She was placed with counselors and was not hospitalized, he said.

Army officials said in a statement the trainee came forward Saturday. They would not say how many in the training cadre, which includes drill sergeants, were being investigated.

""I have had experience with sexual assault allegations and cases,"" Kamper said. ""Not very often do we see the characterization of being assault by cadre members.""

Kamper indicated the allegations did not stem from one incident but rather a series of alleged attacks in the ""training environment"" at Fort Sill.

""We are proud of the courage that she displayed to come forth,"" he said.",
Soldier Says Drill Instructors Sexually Assaulted Her While Enrolled In Training Course,"U.S. Soldiers Train In Fort Benning

The U.S. Army has suspended several drill instructors after they allegedly sexually assaulted a female soldier going through training at Fort Sill in Oklahoma.

On Friday, the Intercept reported that the trainee alleged she was assaulted by a total of 22 service members. The military would not confirm how many soldiers are involved in the allegation but did say the incident is under investigation by agents with the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command.

“At this early juncture and to protect the integrity of the investigation we cannot specify the number of suspects,” Army spokeswoman Colonel Cathy Wilkinson said in a statement. “We are committed to thoroughly investigating every allegation, which will require time to sort through all of the allegations and evidence.”

Major General Ken Kamper, commander of Fort Sill, told reporters on Thursday that the instructors were pulled from their assignments and precluded from interacting with trainees. “What’s important is we’ve taken immediate action with any cadre member that has been named and possibly involved in this allegation,” he said.

The woman has been provided counseling, legal assistance and medical services. Her name hasn’t been released and will remain protected throughout the process. “I personally met with this soldier,” Kamper said. “We’re proud of the courage she displayed coming forward with these allegations.”

Army investigators conducted initial interviews on March 27, the same day the trainee reported the assault, then carried out follow-up interviews two days later and have interviewed Army personnel every day since.

In the military, sexual relationships between trainees and drill instructors aren’t considered consensual because instructors control nearly every aspect of a trainee’s life as they transition from the civilian to military world. There has been several scandals in recent years where drill sergeants or drill instructors have been found to have sexually assaulted service members in training.

Story continues

The incidents are part of a larger scourge that’s become an entrenched reality for female service members in the U.S. military. Despite years of initiatives aimed at combating rape and sexual assault within the ranks, the Pentagon publishes increases in incidents every year. According to the most recent Defense Department reports, sexual assaults have risen steadily since 2006, including a 13% jump in 2018 and a 3% increase in 2019.

The Pentagon has tried to provide more resources for victims and require commanders to do more to stop retaliation for reporting assaults. This issue came into the public spotlight when Army Specialist Vanessa Guillén, 20, was murdered by another soldier last April. Her family alleges she was afraid of reporting sexual harassment to her superiors.

Since taking over at the Pentagon in January, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has tasked military brass to work toward eliminating sexual assault. In one of his first official acts, he directed a top-to-bottom review of its sexual assault policies and created an independent review commission.

The commission, made up of military veterans and experts, began a 90-day investigation this week.",

Companies are rapidly designing private space stations that could one day dominate operations in orbit around Earth.Why it matters: NASA is hoping private industry will start to take over operations in low-Earth orbit once the International Space Station comes to an end, creating a robust commercial market in that part of space.Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for freeCommercially operated private space stations are a big part of NASA's vision to buy services from companies in orbit and then focus on further afield goals like getting to the Moon and Mars.Driving the news: NASA detailed an initiative at the end of March asking companies to partner with them in the development of private space stations that might act as a destination for NASA astronauts and research in the future. Under these agreements, NASA would help support the companies as they develop the space stations and carry out preliminary design reviews — an important technical assessment of what it will take to get a station flying — by the end of fiscal year 2025.On the heels of that announcement, Sierra Nevada Corporation announced its plans to build a private space station.Another company, Axiom Space, already has plans in motion to build its own commercial space station after first attaching a module to the International Space Station at some point in the coming years. Between the lines: NASA wants to avoid having a gap in the agency's regular access to orbit when the ISS is retired before the end of the decade.The space agency was forced to rely on Russia for access to orbit when the space shuttle program ended before commercial flyers like SpaceX were up and running. By partnering with private companies now, the agency is signaling it wants to be able to transition smoothly to private stations instead of a hard stop when the ISS ends.""We're not going to just turn off the lights one day,"" Phil McAlister, director of commercial spaceflight development at NASA, said during an event. ""We're going to have an overlap period where we, over a period of time, draw down the operations of ISS as we increase operations for LEO [low-Earth orbit] destinations. So that gives us some time.""NASA has already effectively proved out this kind of public/private partnership model with SpaceX flying astronauts to orbit. But, but, but: Operating a private space station is a much bigger task than simply launching people to space, and some experts in the industry say there isn't enough time for private companies to get their space stations functioning before the ISS comes to an end. The funding attached to NASA's new program also may not be enough to get these stations off the ground in time.""I don't see how they're going to get it together by 2024 [or] 2028,"" Victoria Samson of the Secure World Foundation told Axios. ""I think it is much more likely that we'll see the Chinese space station well before the commercial space station or a private-sector space station.""

Biden affirms support for Ukraine in first call to leader,"The New York Times

NEW YORK — For New York City’s economy, the last 12 months have amounted to one long, brutal winter. The pandemic forced the shutdown of most of the city’s businesses, wiped out hundreds of thousands of jobs and kept away tens of millions of tourists. By many measures, the nation’s biggest city suffered the greatest losses and faces one of the longest and steepest climbs back. Shows will not return to Broadway stages until after Labor Day, and many workers will not begin commuting to the office and buying lunch at the corner deli for months, if they return at all. But for the first time since the city went on lockdown late last March, there are palpable signs of rebirth, fueled by a growing supply of COVID-19 vaccines and an impending gusher of federal aid to City Hall, the schools, the transit system, restaurants and theaters. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Shoots of the budding optimism pop up almost daily: The Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking Central Park called back workers for a reopening this week. Union Square Café, a popular Manhattan restaurant that had been closed for months, is feeding diners again. Fans were in the stands again when the New York Yankees opened their season in the Bronx on Thursday, though limited to one-fifth of the seats. The city’s outlook has improved as result of the latest stimulus bill, financial analysts say, which included about $6 billion in direct aid to the city government, $6.5 billion to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and $4 billion to the city’s public schools. “There’s a lot of cash that’s going to come in fairly quickly here,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It’s going to provide big pops to places that have been more or less shut down.” The federal aid will help solve some of the city’s biggest short-term problems, including huge drops in revenue from property and sales taxes and fares that the MTA, which runs the subway, buses and two commuter rails, is heavily dependent on. Still, the road to full recovery will be long and steep, business leaders and analysts say. Entire industries, including the arts, hotels and restaurants, were decimated, with thousands of businesses closing for good. Tourism, a pillar of the economy, is years away from rebounding, according to forecasts. And many companies are making at least some remote work a permanent feature, raising questions about the future of Manhattan without legions of office workers. “The city still has a ways to go,” said Ana Champeny, director of city studies for the Citizens Budget Commission. “You’ve got to get commuters back in Midtown and downtown, the business district. You’ve got to get restaurants and theaters reopened.” The infusion of federal aid has provided some reason for hope. The MTA has gone from threatening to sharply reduce service and lay off workers to promising to restore 24-hour subway service, which was suspended during the pandemic. Many restaurants that struggled to survive through a monthslong ban on indoor dining can try to recoup losses and the costs of adapting to pandemic restrictions. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader from New York, said the aid that will flow to New York state and its residents from the stimulus bill, known as the American Rescue Plan, amounted to nearly $100 billion. Mayor Bill de Blasio will lay out a plan for spending the direct aid when he presents his budget in April, said a spokeswoman, Laura Feyer. The mayor said the aid would enable the city “to finally overcome the massive revenue loss and to serve our people, keep our workforce strong, bring our city back.” The direct local aid “can put the city on solid fiscal footing,” said Champeny, though the city still faces large budget deficits in future years. “It is an incredibly generous package that will definitely start the rebuild.” The rebuild faces formidable challenges. The New York metropolitan area lost more than 1 million jobs in 2020, close to double the Los Angeles area’s loss and triple the Chicago area’s, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The city’s official unemployment rate rose to 12.9% in February, more than double the national rate, which was 6.2% in February and fell to 6% in March.) The job losses fell harder on those who were clinging to the lower rungs of the city’s economic ladder. Low-paying jobs that cannot be done from home accounted for most of the losses, and many may not come back for years, if ever, economists said. New York was especially vulnerable to the pandemic’s economic pummeling because of its heavy reliance on tourists and business travelers to fill hotel beds and seats in restaurants, theaters and stadiums. The number of foreign visitors to New York is not expected to reach its 2019 level before 2025, according to the city’s tourism promotion agency. New York’s office towers are still largely empty, and the exodus of office workers from Manhattan — many of whom are not expected to return until the last half of the year — has crippled merchants and significantly reduced the value of much of the city’s commercial real estate, which will translate into a big drop in sales and property tax revenue. The city’s Independent Budget Office projected that the city’s recovery would remain “fragile and tentative for many more months.” Though a snapback in hiring this year and next would replace about 400,000 of the jobs the city lost, the budget office said that by the end of 2024 New York would still not have as many jobs as it did before the pandemic started. More than 200 of the city’s 700 hotels remain closed, leaving thousands of workers still unemployed, said Vijay Dandapani, chief executive of the Hotel Association of New York City. “My industry fell off a cliff on March 22 last year,” he said. Many hotel operators have received no federal aid during the pandemic, and nearly half are in default on their mortgages, Dandapani said. More than 40 hotels have fallen behind on their property tax payments to the city, which could put them in “a downward spiral” that they cannot escape, he added. But even the beleaguered hotel business is seeing glimmers of recovery. The Mandarin Oriental rehired more than 100 members of the Hotel Trades Council union for its reopening on Thursday, the hotel’s manager, Susanne Hatje, said. The Mandarin is offering discounted rates starting at $716 per night, 20% below prepandemic prices. The nearby Park Hyatt also reopened on Thursday, and other hotels are expected to join the trend as tourists trickle back. During the week that ended March 20, the city’s hotels had an occupancy rate of 50.8%, the highest in more than a year, according to STR, an industry research firm. Tourism may start to pick up slightly by late summer if fans return to the stands at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens. And if delegates come back to Manhattan in September for the United Nations General Assembly, hotels may fill more rooms. The city’s tourism promotion agency, NYC & Co., has forecast that the number of visitors will climb to 38 million this year, up from about 23 million in 2020, but still down about 40% from a record high level in 2019. Despite the city’s precarious situation, E.J. McMahon, founder of the Empire Center, a conservative research group, said he was wary about the extraordinary amount of federal aid flowing to the region. The pandemic’s impact on New York’s economy appears to be much deeper and longer lasting than the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack two decades ago, he said. “There’s going to be a hangover from this, a significant hangover.” Still, McMahon questioned, “What it is that government can do to actually re-create the economy?” Many of the lost jobs, such as cleaning hotel rooms and serving food, did not require much skill or extensive training, he said. “There’s a lot of potential here for problems and abuse of the money.” But James A. Parrott, an economist at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School, argued that the city should use some of the federal aid to retrain workers who have lost their jobs. “Tens of thousands of jobs will permanently disappear, and the city needs to do more to preserve the businesses that are trying to hang on,” Parrott said. “The city has never had a challenge on this scale before.” The restaurant business is one important part of New York’s private-sector economy that will benefit directly from the stimulus bill. The bill included more than $28 billion for restaurants across the nation that have been among the businesses worst hit by the pandemic’s economic fallout. A sizable chunk of that aid will likely go to New York’s restaurants because they experienced some of the longest and most severe restrictions, said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group. A recent survey by the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, estimated that 5,000 restaurants in the city had shut down for good during the pandemic. “This will save countless restaurants and jobs,” Rigie said. “It’s horrible that restaurants had to wait a year for this funding, but better late than never.” While it may take some time, “the city is going to see a big revival,” Zandi said. “It’s going to come roaring back.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
Biden holds first call with Ukrainian president amid Russian buildup,"President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on Friday morning for the first time since Biden took office, amid reports of a Russian military buildup in eastern Ukraine that has alarmed U.S. and Ukrainian officials.

The leaders spoke for 30 to 40 minutes, according to a person with knowledge of the call. A White House readout of the conversation said Biden “reaffirmed the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea.”

The leaders also discussed Zelensky’s anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, which are “central to Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations,” the readout says.

The conversation follows at least three high-level calls between the U.S. and Ukraine this week between Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and their Ukrainian counterparts.

Ukrainian officials had been pushing for a call between Zelensky and Biden for weeks, including in a recent call between national security adviser Jake Sullivan and top Zelensky aid Andriy Yermak, according to one person familiar with their conversation.

Biden had been keeping Ukraine at arm's length while quietly pushing for further reforms in a country he spent years getting to know as vice president, and one that is a critical front in the West’s efforts to contain Russia.

But Ukrainian officials have been advocating for a show of support from the U.S. president amid renewed fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian soldiers in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine that killed four Ukrainian soldiers last week.

The clashes marked the end of a June 2020 ceasefire, and Russian forces have begun building up military equipment along the border. U.S. European Command raised its alert status to the highest level following the skirmishes.

The Pentagon is on alert as Russia has more broadly stepped up its activity in Eastern Europe and the Arctic over the past week. NATO jets scrambled 10 times on Monday alone to respond to Russian fighter and bomber flights near allied airspace. And last week, three nuclear-armed Russian submarines surfaced in the Arctic, a new show of force in a challenging region.

Story continues

Gen. Glen VanHerck, head of U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for homeland defense, acknowledged the recent uptick in Russian aggression, pointing to Moscow’s efforts to “reassert its influence on a global stage.”

The Biden administration recently approved an additional $125 million worth of lethal aid to Ukraine to defend its borders with Russia, including two armed patrol boats and counter-artillery radar. While the Obama administration sent military equipment to Ukraine, the lethal aid didn't come until the Trump administration. The U.S. has committed more than $2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, including providing Javelin anti-tank missiles.

“We obviously don’t want to see any more violations of Ukrainian territory,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said this week. “We’ve been very clear about the threats that we see from Russia across domains ... we’re taking them very seriously.”",
Former Florida GOP congressman: State politicians assuming Gaetz's career is over,"Scandal-ridden Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said he isn't resigning from Congress, but his ""political brethren"" in Florida ""are already jockeying to take his seat,"" The Wall Street Journal reports.

The Justice Department is reportedly investigating payments Gaetz and an indicted Florida politician, former Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, made to women allegedly recruited online for sex. The investigation is also looking into whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl.

While Gaetz told the Journal he has no plans to step down, former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) thinks he may not have any other options. ""These scandals hit a certain point where there's no escape,"" Jolly, who is no longer a member of the GOP, told the Journal, noting that Florida's politicians are ""assuming"" Gaetz's career is finished. ""We've clearly hit that point for Matt in politics.""

Former President Donald Trump may also be in that camp, at least for now. Gaetz is a fervent Trump ally, but Trump's advisers have told him to stay out of the situation, two people familiar with the matter told The Daily Beast. Trump has reportedly said privately that things seem ""really bad"" for Gaetz, but he has also reportedly at least entertained the possibility it's a smear campaign. ""For something like this, a ten-foot pole is not long enough,"" Barry Bennett, a GOP operative who advised Trump during his 2016 campaign, told The Daily Beast. ""The former president should stay as far away from this as possible.""

"Federal investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz is focused on cash payments to women, report says","A Justice Department investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is focused on alleged cash payments made in exchange for sex, including to a 17-year-old girl, according to The New York Times.

Citing unnamed sources familiar with the investigation, text messages and receipts, the Times reported that the Florida Republican is suspected of having sex with women recruited online by Joel Greenberg – a former Seminole County tax collector who has been indicted on federal charges including sex trafficking – for encounters at hotels and other locations that on at least one occasion involved the use of the illegal drug ecstasy.

According to the Times' sources, Gaetz also asked the women to recruit others for sex with him and his friends. At least one of the women agreed to have sex with a third man connected to Florida Republican politics, the Times reported.

Gaetz, 38, has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted the allegations were related to an extortion plot against him. His office did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment but told the Times in a statement that ""Matt Gaetz has never paid for sex"" and the congressman ""refutes all the disgusting allegations completely.""

""Matt Gaetz cherishes the relationships in his past and looks forward to marrying the love of his life,"" the statement said.

The Times said it reviewed receipts from mobile payment applications Cash App and Apple Pay that showed payments from Gaetz and Greenberg to one of the women. The women told their friends they had received payments for sex with the two men, which were also sometimes paid with cash withdrawn from hotel ATMs, the paper reported.

Story continues

The Justice Department is reportedly exploring whether an underage girl was among those Greenberg and Gaetz paid for sex. The Times reported the inquiry is looking into whether Gaetz had sex with the girl, 17, and if she received any cash or gifts from him.

Gaetz and Greenberg were political allies and Gaetz, now in his third term, offered to back Greenberg if he ran for higher office. But Greenberg resigned as tax collector after he was arrested last year by federal agents in a 14-count indictment alleging he stalked a political rival, used his position to create fake IDs and sex trafficked a minor.

Last week, he was indicted on additional charges for allegedly filing fraudulent claims to obtain COVID-19 relief loans and bribing a Small Business Administration official as part of the scheme. The indictment alleges he committed those offenses after his arrest on the other charges. Greenberg, who is scheduled to go on trial in June, is now indicted on more than 30 counts and, if convicted, could face decades in prison.

According to multiple media reports, the investigation into Greenberg led investigators to open a separate investigation into Gaetz in the summer of 2020. The child sex trafficking charge centers on the same 17-year-old girl involved in the Gaetz investigation, according to the Times.

The encounters under investigation occurred in 2019 and 2020 and often took place at various Florida hotels. The Times said messages and interviews showed Gaetz and Greenberg told the women where and when to meet and how much they were willing to pay.

According to the Times, Greenberg used the website Seeking Arrangement to find the women he and Gaetz allegedly paid for sex. The website, which claims to have more than 10 million active members, bills itself as a place where ""Sugar Babies and Sugar Daddies or Mommas both get what they want, when they want it."" It defines a ""Sugar Daddy"" as a successful person who ""enjoy attractive company by their side"" and for whom money ""isn’t an issue."" A ""Sugar Baby"" is defined as an ""attractive"" person ""looking for the finer things in life"" who appreciates ""exotic trips and gifts.""

""Sugar Babies get to experience a luxurious lifestyle, and meet wealthy people on a regular basis,"" the site promises.

""I only know that it has to do with women,"" Gaetz told the Times of the investigation. ""I have a suspicion that someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.""

Gaetz's communications director, Luke Ball, resigned Friday amid the mounting allegations. Ball resigned ""out of principle,"" a source with direct knowledge of his decision told the Pensacola News Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.

A statement from Gaetz's office said the congressman and Ball ""agreed that it would be best to part ways. We thank him for his time in our office, and we wish him the best moving forward.""

Citing multiple unnamed sources, CNN reported Thursday night that Gaetz has often bragged of his sexual activities to his colleagues on Capitol Hill and shared nude photos and videos of the women he claimed to have been with.

And ABC News, also citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that as a member of the Flordia Legislature – before he was elected to the U.S. House – Gaetz and other young lawmakers had created a scoring system for their sexual encounters.

A Justice Department investigation into GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida is looking into money he and a political ally paid directly to women via apps, The New York Times reported Thursday. According to the report, which cited several unnamed sources familiar with the case, the women said they were paid for sex.

Sources told The Times that Joel Greenberg, the former tax collector in Seminole County, Florida, who has been indicted on multiple counts including those related to sex trafficking, connected with women online.

Gaetz has denied ever paying for sex.

On Thursday, The Times, citing four people familiar with the investigation, reported that Gaetz and Greenberg are both being investigated for potentially having illegal sexual relationships with the same 17-year-old girl, as well as with women who they allegedly paid to have sex.

The report claims that Greenberg introduced Gaetz to several women via websites like SeekingArrangements.com, where wealthy people and members can seek ""sugar daddy"" relationships, oftentimes sex and intimacy in exchange for gifts.

According to The Times report, Gaetz and Greenberg met various women at hotels in Florida and paid for sexual encounters.

Story continues

Some of the people involved, including Gaetz, took ecstasy prior to the encounters, according to people familiar with the meetups and with the Justice Department interviews, The Times reported.

The Times reviewed Cash App transactions between Greenberg, Gaetz, and several women mentioned in the interviews.

CNN reported Thursday that the Justice Department investigation includes whether Gaetz used any federal campaign funds to pay for the women's travel or other expenses.

Sources also told CNN investigators are looking into reports from witnesses that Gaetz used money and drugs in his encounters with the women.

In August 2020, Greenberg was indicted on fourteen counts, including sex trafficking charges related to a minor between the age of 14 and 17. According to the Orlando Sentinel, prosecutors allege that Greenberg used his access as an elected official to seek information on women via the Florida Driver and Vehicle Information Database and engage relationships with them.

On Tuesday, an explosive report from The New York Times revealed that Gaetz is under federal investigation for potentially violating federal sex trafficking laws. The Times reported that the investigation into Gaetz stemmed from the federal investigation into Greenberg.

The Times wrote that the Department of Justice is looking into ""whether he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her to travel with him,"" possibly violating federal sex-trafficking laws. The investigation was opened by the Department of Justice in the final months of former President Donald Trump's administration, according to The Times.

Since news of the sex-trafficking probe broke, the story has taken many turns.

Gaetz immediately denied the allegations and claimed that he and his family are victims of an extortion scheme. Hours after Tuesday's story in The Times, Gaetz appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News, vehemently denying the allegations and repeating the extortion claims.

Gaetz said the extortion scheme started weeks ago, but the sex-trafficking investigation started last year.

On Thursday, separate from the investigation, CNN also reported that Gaetz showed House colleagues nude photos of women he had slept with, and bragged openly about his sex life.

Insider reached out to Gaetz's office for additional comment.

Leaker says they are offering private details of 500 million Facebook users,"By Raphael Satter

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A leaker says they are offering information on more than 500 million Facebook Inc users - including phone numbers and other data - virtually for free.

The database appears to be the same set of Facebook-linked telephone numbers that has been circulating in hacker circles since January and whose existence was first reported by tech publication Motherboard, according to Alon Gal, co-founder of Israeli cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock.

Reuters was not immediately able to vet the information, which is being offered for a few euros' worth of digital credit on a well-known site for low-level hackers, but Gal said on Saturday that he had verified the authenticity of at least some of the data by comparing it against phone numbers of people he knew. Other journalists say they have also been able to match known phone numbers to the details in the data dump.

In a statement, Facebook said that the data was ""very old"" and related to an issue that it had fixed in August 2019.

An attempt by Reuters to reach the leaker over the messaging service Telegram was not immediately successful.

Gal told Reuters that Facebook users should be alert to ""social engineering attacks"" by people who may have obtained their phone numbers or other private data in the coming months.

3 dead in North Carolina house shooting,"The Conversation

John James Audubon's 'Carolina Parakeets.' Wikimedia CommonsIt was winter in upstate New York in 1780 in a rural town called Schoharie, home to the deeply religious Palatine Germans. Suddenly, a flock of gregarious red and green birds flew into town, seemingly upon a whirlwind. The townspeople thought the end of the world was upon them. Though the robin-sized birds left quickly, their appearance was forever imprinted on local lore. As author Benjamin Smith Barton wrote, “The more ignorant Dutch settlers were exceedingly alarmed. They imagined, in dreadful consternation, that it portended nothing less calamitous than the destruction of the world.” You and I know that the birds weren’t a precursor of mankind’s demise – but in a way, there was impending doom ahead. These birds were Carolina parakeets, America’s only native parrot. In February 1918, the last captive Carolina parakeet died, alone in a cage in the Cincinnati Zoo, the same zoo where the last captive passenger pigeon, named Martha, died four years earlier. The last “official” wild Carolina parakeet was spotted in Florida just two years later. Why did these birds go extinct? It remains a mystery. Given that parrots today are at greater risk for extinction than other major bird groups, is there anything scientists can learn from the Carolina parakeet? Unraveling parakeet mysteries Over the past six years, I’ve been collecting information about where the Carolina parakeet was observed over the last 450 years.

John James Audubon's 'Carolina Parakeets.' Wikimedia CommonsIt was winter in upstate New York in 1780 in a rural town called Schoharie, home to the deeply religious Palatine Germans. Suddenly, a flock of gregarious red and green birds flew into town, seemingly upon a whirlwind. The townspeople thought the end of the world was upon them. Though the robin-sized birds left quickly, their appearance was forever imprinted on local lore. As author Benjamin Smith Barton wrote, “The more ignorant Dutch settlers were exceedingly alarmed. They imagined, in dreadful consternation, that it portended nothing less calamitous than the destruction of the world.” You and I know that the birds weren’t a precursor of mankind’s demise – but in a way, there was impending doom ahead. These birds were Carolina parakeets, America’s only native parrot. In February 1918, the last captive Carolina parakeet died, alone in a cage in the Cincinnati Zoo, the same zoo where the last captive passenger pigeon, named Martha, died four years earlier. The last “official” wild Carolina parakeet was spotted in Florida just two years later. Why did these birds go extinct? It remains a mystery. Given that parrots today are at greater risk for extinction than other major bird groups, is there anything scientists can learn from the Carolina parakeet? Unraveling parakeet mysteries Over the past six years, I’ve been collecting information about where the Carolina parakeet was observed over the last 450 years.

"For a week, all eyes were on the Suez. Here's the story of how it was unblocked.","Eslam Negm is no stranger to disarray on the Suez Canal.

As a sailor on rescue tugboat Baraka 1, the Egyptian regularly confronts fires, evacuations and loading problems on the 50 or so cargo ships that transit the canal daily.

But when Negm got a call from his manager last week to help refloat a stranded container vessel, he said pictures did not prepare him for the days of havoc ahead.

The giant ship was traveling from China to the Netherlands, carrying upward of 20,000 shipping containers, when it turned sideways near the southern end of the canal early on March 23. Its bow became jammed in the canal's sandy eastern wall, with its stern lodged against its western wall.

The canal was blocked, and a good portion of global shipping traffic was backed up behind it.

Early reports suggested strong winds and poor visibility from a sandstorm were to blame, and the causes are now the subject of a lengthy and high-profile investigation.

But for Negm and hundreds of other workers, the remarkable rescue of the Ever Given cargo ship was a job, and a memorable one. In a series of interviews with NBC News, he and other maritime workers described a massive and international operation that relied on hard labor, new technology and ultimately the moon to free the ship. While the world marveled at the skyscraper-size vessel and fretted over the backlog, it was local workers, engineers and tugboat captains who toiled through sleepless nights and hungry days to restore shipping on the canal.

That’s because Suez is not just a cornerstone of national pride and a crucial international trading route, but a vital source of income and job security for thousands of Egyptians.

“We live off that,” said Negm, 32.

Sleepless on the Suez

As initial rescue efforts floundered, the Egyptians were joined by international salvage teams that brought the expertise and brawn necessary to dislodge the 220,000-ton ship.

The Suez Canal Authority gave orders while a Dutch firm that specializes in salvage operations acted as project manager, guiding a fleet of tugboats, dredgers and diggers.

Story continues

Negm and the hundreds more involved in the rescue worked around the clock and against the current in freezing conditions. Acting as a lifeline to the stranded tanker, the Baraka tugboat was connected by cable to the ship’s bow.

Frustrations among its 20 crew members ran high as the Ever Given remained stubbornly unmoved.

“Emotions during the long days of rescue were extremely difficult,” said Mahmoud Shalabi, 36, the tugboat’s head technician.

To free the ship’s jammed bow, dredgers worked around the clock to clear at least 27,000 metric tons of sand to a depth of 60 feet.

The work was not just difficult but dangerous for those toiling in the Ever Given’s vast shadow.

“We were working under something the size of a 10-story building that could have fallen on us,” said Aly Awamy, a mechanic on the Mashhour dredging ship.

As he looked up at the wedged tanker, Shalabi, the Baraka technician, recalls thinking that it looked as if the boat had been driven like a car swerving another “abruptly and about to hit the pavement.”

Bahaa Ramadan, a mechanical engineer, was walking from his village perched high on the canal’s west bank to his office in Ismailia on the morning of March 24, a day after the initial grounding, when he first spotted the unusual sight of a ship lodged “totally” sideways.

He watched from his office’s roof as each day came and went with little progress in unblocking the waterway. The news consumed the surrounding rural villages, he said — locals hadn’t talked about the canal this much since it closed during the 1967 war, when Egypt and other Arab nations were dealt a crushing defeat by neighboring Israel.

In Cairo, Mohamed el Gamel was fielding frantic WhatsApp messages at 5 a.m. Gamel, the CEO of Maridive, an Egyptian maritime and oil service company, was organizing the arrival of a tugboat that was stationed hours away from the crisis point in the gulf of the canal.

After initially turning down Maridive’s offer to help, canal authorities asked for backup once they realized the size of the task in front of them. The company’s tugboat was eventually positioned on the opposite end of Baraka 1 to help pull out the ship’s stern.

'An absolute miracle'

The crisis was now not just the talk of Egypt’s 100 million residents, but much of the world.

And pressure was mounting, with the maritime traffic jam holding up at least $9 billion in trade a day and forcing a growing backlog of vessels carrying oil, consumer goods and livestock.

The country’s strongman president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, took to calling canal officials three times a day, Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, said at a news conference this week.

And by the end of the week the rescue effort had become an international affair. Danish maritime operation provider Svitzer sent two tugboats to sail 10 hours from their station at Port Said to join the growing fleet surrounding the massive cargo ship.

Kaspar Friis Nilaus, the company’s CEO, said, “It was a huge team effort with canal officials coordinating the whole thing.”

Finally progress seemed possible.

The ship made its first move since the grounding on Friday evening, but weather conditions frustrated any hopes of a breakthrough and its bow remained jammed in the sand and dirt.

“It was high adrenaline for several hours,” said Shahira Zeid, chairwoman of Maridive.

A “new generation” Dutch tugboat came to the scene on Sunday with a pulling power double that of the Baraka, playing a major role in eventually liberating the ship, Negm said.

“The arrival of the last ones, the very, very big ones. That was needed,” Nilaus said.

Then at dawn on Monday, March 29, after six days, the elements aligned.

For all the human toil and modern equipment, the rescue efforts ultimately relied upon a power beyond their control: the tides.

“When it comes right down to it, we're still relying on the same seamanship. It was the moon and a moontide that helped float the vessel,” said Andrew Kinsey, a maritime risk consultant for Allianz.

Staring down from the bridge of the tugboat he had manned for the best part of a week, Negm could scarcely believe his eyes as the Ever Given began to budge.

Said his shipmate, Shalabi: “No matter how hard I try to articulate how I felt, I will never be able to give that feeling justice. Everyone was completely ecstatic.”

Partially refloated in the morning, the ship was finally freed at around 3 p.m. local time, allowing the canal to reopen later that night.

Initially vilified as false rumors surfaced on social media in Egypt that canal workers had intentionally shut down the vital trade route, the Suez rescuers were quickly hailed as heroes by the local press and their government.

Ramadan, the office worker, said many villagers thought the rescue was “an absolute miracle” that defied logic after they had seen just how jammed the ship was.

Chants usually reserved for soccer stadiums swept cafes and outdoor spaces, but for Negm it was his mother crying on the phone as she called to congratulate him that made it all worthwhile.

“She knew how difficult this problem was because she also worked on the Suez,” he said.

'Balancing act'

As that happiness begins to settle, investigators have many questions to answer, including the cause of the accident and who will pay for the damage done.

After a severe dust storm and strong winds were initially cited as causes for the ship’s grounding, Rabie, the canal authority chairman, said Sunday that “technical or human errors” could have also caused it.

Kinsey, the risk consultant and former ship captain, who has taken dozens of trips down the canal, said that in such crises there is rarely a single cause, but rather a chain of events, or what sailors call an “error chain.” When a ship is that wide, he said, the “delicate balancing act” between its captain and Egyptian canal pilots leaves an extremely slim margin of error.

To pass through the canal, a vital corridor between Europe and Asia that helps shorten voyages and speed up trade, ships must pay authorities an administrative fee and enlist the help of dedicated pilots who help guide their voyage through the narrow channel.

Tales of demands for cartons of cigarettes by canal staffers — many now retired sailors from the Egyptian navy — are common and can add to tense relations.

“They don't ask for one or two cartons. They go about their numbers, like 12 or 20 cartons,” said Suraj Joshi, a former Merchant Navy sailor.

The pilots are likely to be one focus of the probe in the months to come, but other former sailors and canal officials concurred that ultimate responsibility for navigating the canal lies with the captain.

As the Egyptian authorities lead an investigation that will analyze the ship’s black box, the ship’s fate is managed by what John Konrad, who runs the maritime news website gCaptain, calls an “international conglomerate,” leaving many parties ready to point fingers and shift blame in a maritime compensation battle that will likely last years.

It's a transcontinental affair, since the ship’s owners are Japanese, the operator is German, the insurance company is British, the charter is Taiwanese and the canal pilots are Egyptian — all while the ship itself is flagged to Panama.

“It’s done that way on purpose,” Konrad, a former ship captain, said. “Because no one has skin in the game except the captain and the cabin crew.”

A spokesperson for Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the ship’s technical operator, told NBC News that initial investigations “have ruled out any mechanical or engine failure onboard.”

The Suez Canal Authority and Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the company that owns the vessel, both declined to comment on the investigation while it is ongoing. Evergreen Line, the ship’s charter company, did not respond to a request for comment.

Canal officials and experts say answers may lie in the ship’s black box, known as the voyage data recorder.

Rabie, the canal authority chairman, told Egyptian TV on Thursday that the captain hadn't handed the box over to investigators yet, presumably because he is in the process of hiring a lawyer to represent him.

The ship, meanwhile, may be free but it has not yet left the canal.

The last ships stranded by a blocked vessel in the Suez Canal, which held up movement from both sides for six days in one of the world's largest trading routes, have finally passed through.

According to the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) the shipping backlog caused by the traffic jam was now cleared.

On Saturday, it expected the remaining 85 ships to pass through the waterway. These included the last 61 ships out of more than 400 ships that were queuing when the Ever Given container vessel was dislodged earlier this week.

While the canal authority said that the Suez Canal is operating in full capacity and around the clock, the crisis saw 422 ships stranded in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea when the 200,000-tonne Ever Green, which is capable of carrying 20,000 shipping containers, became wedged across the Suez on 23 March.

Last weekend, 14 tugboats pulled and pushed the Ever Given at high tide to try to dislodge it and were able to move the ship ""30 degrees from left and right."" ​

On Monday 29 March, after several attempts to refloat the vessel, the SCA said the ship had been ""successfully refloated.""

Chairman of the SCA, Osama Rabie added that an investigation into what caused the vessel to run aground, is due to wrap up soon. ""The investigation is going well and will take two more days, then we will announce the results,"" Rabie said. The authority is expected to publish its findings next week.

On Thursday, Rabie announced Egypt is seeking over $1bn (£723m) in compensation due to the ordeal. He warned that the ship and its some $3.5bn worth of cargo will not be allowed to leave the country if the issue goes to court.

However, he added that if the investigation goes smoothly and the issue of damages is agreed between the country and the ship's owners, then the vessel would be allowed to travel.

The Japanese owners Shoei Kisen Kaisha, or the Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine Corp — who had charted the ship — are expected to be liable for the compensation. The money will cover the costs of the salvage operation, transit fees that were lost and the costs associated with stopping all traffic in the Suez Canal.

Global supply chains have been crippled and the shipping industry thrown into disarray since the crisis started. Many companies and countries were forced to reconsider options, including rationing oil.

Efforts were also made after initial reports that the Panama-flagged ship could be stuck for weeks. This led to firms rerouting trade to sail around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, which costs more and typically adds around two weeks onto journeys.

The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.

Built in 1869, the Suez Canal is used by around 50 vessels per day, according to Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Container ships accounted for 52.7% of the tonnage in 2019 transiting the canal including shipments from Asia to Europe and the US east coast as well as vice-versa.

An estimated $9.6bn (£7bn) of goods were being held up by the ship each day as the blockage continued.

Oil prices were driven higher following the crisis, with (BZ=F) and Crude oil (CL=F) rising by as much as 4%.

Holocaust survivor Shalom Stamberg holds a book with a photo of himself in Auschwitz, alongside a copy of his concentration camp record. AP Photo/Ariel SchalitOne in four American millennials believe the Holocaust was exaggerated or entirely made up, according to a recent national survey that sought to find out what young adults know about the genocide of nearly 6 million Jews at the hands of Nazis some 80 years ago. That startling statistic was cited as one of the main reasons that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided in October to finally ban Holocaust denial across the social network. Denying the Holocaust ever happened is an enduring form of anti-Semitic propaganda that attempts to deny or minimize the atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jews during World War II. Following Facebook’s lead, Twitter announced it, too, would remove any posts that denied the history of the Holocaust, though CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to contradict that policy at a Senate hearing weeks later. Holocaust deniers have continued to emerge in social media, and perhaps predictably, many have migrated to less restrictive sites like Parler, where hashtags like #HolocaustNeverHappened and #HolocaustIsALie are widespread. “If you want Holocaust denial, hey, Parler is going to be great for you,” Bill Gates recently said of the social network. While some tech companies address the rise in Holocaust revisionism, and others leave the door open, social networks have played an unwitting role in helping to distort the memory of these horrific events. But as a scholar who studies online extremism, I believe that same community could do more to protect Holocaust remembrance by highlighting the digitized accounts of those who lived through it. French Holocaust survivor Victor Perahia, interned as a child in the Drancy camp outside Paris and then deported to Bergen-Belsen, speaks to students during a January 2020 workshop dedicated to Holocaust remembrance at Drancy. AP Photo/Christophe Ena A decadeslong campaign Holocaust denial has been a tool of anti-Semitic movements since the 1960s. Pseudo-academic groups like the Institute for Historical Review, for example, spent years working to distort the public’s aging memory of the Holocaust, which took place between 1933 and 1945. They tried to cast doubt on the feasibility of the mass executions, and even the existence of the gas chambers. They held annual conferences and gathered fellow deniers to share their beliefs that these events were conjured up by the Jewish people mostly as a means to justify the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. A photo taken April 12, 1945, shows just some of the bodies found by U.S. troops when they arrived at Nordhausen concentration camp in Germany. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library For decades, most people quickly discarded those claims, because they had heard the firsthand accounts of the survivors who were sent to the camps and witnessed the daily operation of genocide and murder of family members. The allegations of the deniers could also not withstand the accounts of soldiers who liberated the camps and made the terrible discoveries of body-filled crematoriums and mass graves. But for deniers, Holocaust revision has little to do with history. Denialism is really a pretext for delivering anti-Semitism in the form of “scholarship,” although few academics ever gave it such attention. So hate groups had to find other means of circulation. They found it online. An image from a film taken during the Soviet liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in early 1945 shows children who had survived the Holocaust. Belarusian State Archive of Documentary Film and Photography/United States Holocaust Memorial Museum via Wikimedia Commons A conspiracy resurrected When the internet took off in the late 1990s, Holocaust deniers and countless other conspiracy theorists saw an opportunity to spread their ideas to new audiences. Anti-Semitic groups could now publish their distortions in well-visited forums, and later in faux-informational websites like Metapedia and The Occidental Observer – extremist communities, in fact, that collectively receive some 350,000 visitors each month. The internet also gave Holocaust deniers an opportunity to reach a much wider public through social media. As early as 2009, Facebook groups emerged that were dedicated to “debunking” the Holocaust, as #Holohoax became a popular hashtag on Twitter, which it continues to be today. Reddit also became a far-right haven for Holocaust deniers, one of whom gained national attention when he was the invited guest of a Florida congressman to the 2018 State of the Union address. For deniers, the internet helped repackage their conspiracy into something less recognizable than hate. I’ve long studied this process, which I call information laundering, tracking illegitimate forms of information, like Holocaust denial, that flow through social networks, blogs and search engines. There they intermix with mainstream ideas and slowly become washed of their radical origins. This decadeslong campaign has resulted in the current surveys that show nearly a quarter of young adults are misinformed or skeptical about the Holocaust. Only now, few survivors are left to correct the record. That makes it even more important to spread the truth. Perhaps the internet can help. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower views the charred bodies of prisoners after the 1945 liberation of the Nazis’ Ohrdruf concentration camp. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library Eisenhower’s intuition When Gen. Dwight Eisenhower visited the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945, after its liberation by U.S. forces, he realized how impossible it might be for people to believe the scale of Nazi atrocities. He wrote powerfully of the experience, and of his reasons for going to see it in person: “The things I saw beggar description. … In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. … I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the near future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to ‘propaganda.’” Eisenhower’s words are instructions for future generations. They underscore the need to be a witness to human cruelty in order to protect the memory of, and lessons learned from, these events from those who would try to distort them. Back online, it may not be enough for social networks to ban Holocaust denial. Similar bans in Europe haven’t limited the rise of anti-Semitism there. Instead, social networks could follow Eisenhower’s example by answering the falsehoods of Holocaust deniers with the true stories of survivors. The internet is already home to thousands of digitized survivor testimonies. They include oral histories that could be readily activated by social networks to refute those who deny the existence of the gas chambers with the accounts of those who stood inside them or witnessed them at work. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit might share the firsthand stories of the Nazi persecutions, separations at the camps or rare reunions, wherever false claims arise, to counter denials with facts. Holocaust survivor Cecilie Klein-Pollack, the author’s grandmother. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum In the spirit of that counternarrative, I will place my grandmother’s story here. She was a Holocaust survivor. She later wrote about her experiences in Auschwitz, where, upon arrival, she and her sister were separated from their mother and her sister’s son, never to see them again. There are millions of other experiences like hers, and survivors of other genocides whose stories must be retold as well, from Armenia to Rwanda. [Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.] Holocaust deniers have long waited for the time when there were no remaining survivors or witnesses to keep these histories alive. But the internet is a powerful archive. Social networks have an opportunity to combat hateful disinformation by posting the personal stories of these tragedies, and end the so-called “debate” about whether the Holocaust ever happened. As Eisenhower well understood, history needs protecting.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Former president calls on fans to ‘boycott baseball’Obama lauds MLB ‘for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights’ Mike Pence laughs as Donald Trump holds a baseball bat at the White House in 2017. Photograph: Carlos Barría/Reuters Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson led rightwing backlash after Major League Baseball said it would not play its All-Star game in Georgia because of a new law that restricts voting rights in the state. The former president and the Fox News host some say is his Republican political heir thereby ranged themselves against current president Joe Biden and the Democrat he served as vice-president, Barack Obama. “Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans,” Trump said in a statement, “and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the radical left Democrats. “… Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with free and fair elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta and all?” Coke and Delta are among companies which have expressed concern over the Georgia law, which restricts early and mail-in voting, measures seen to target minority voters likely to back Democrats. Laws under consideration in other Republican-run states have attracted criticism from corporate America. The Georgia law was passed by Republicans after Biden won the state against Trump and Democrats won both Senate runoff elections in January. Referring to the segregation of the post-civil war south, Biden called the law: “Jim Crow in the 21st century.” In his own statement on Saturday, Obama congratulated MLB “for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens”. He also said: “There’s no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example.” Aaron, known as the Hammer, was a long-time MLB home-run record holder who played for the Atlanta Braves and endured racist abuse throughout his life in the sport. He died in January, aged 86.

Photograph: Carlos Barría/Reuters Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson led rightwing backlash after Major League Baseball said it would not play its All-Star game in Georgia because of a new law that restricts voting rights in the state. The former president and the Fox News host some say is his Republican political heir thereby ranged themselves against current president Joe Biden and the Democrat he served as vice-president, Barack Obama. “Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans,” Trump said in a statement, “and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the radical left Democrats. “… Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with free and fair elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta and all?” Coke and Delta are among companies which have expressed concern over the Georgia law, which restricts early and mail-in voting, measures seen to target minority voters likely to back Democrats. Laws under consideration in other Republican-run states have attracted criticism from corporate America. The Georgia law was passed by Republicans after Biden won the state against Trump and Democrats won both Senate runoff elections in January. Referring to the segregation of the post-civil war south, Biden called the law: “Jim Crow in the 21st century.” In his own statement on Saturday, Obama congratulated MLB “for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens”. He also said: “There’s no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example.” Aaron, known as the Hammer, was a long-time MLB home-run record holder who played for the Atlanta Braves and endured racist abuse throughout his life in the sport.

Cooking oil or crude? Italian restaurant owner was mistaken target of U.S. sanctions,"By Daphne Psaledakis and Luc Cohen

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the final acts of the Trump administration was almost certainly one of the most confounding for Alessandro Bazzoni, a restaurant owner in Verona, Italy.

As part of a crackdown on blacklisted Venezuelan crude, former President Donald Trump's Treasury Department accidentally slapped sanctions against his company on Jan. 19 in a case of mistaken identity.

""It was a mistake,"" Bazzoni said, speaking to Reuters by telephone from his restaurant in Verona on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Treasury reversed course and acknowledged its error, removing sanctions from AMG S.A.S. Di Alessandro Bazzoni & C., as well as sanctions on what appears to be a graphic design company in Porto Torres, Italy.

A Treasury official said the department realized the companies were owned by different individuals than the Bazzoni it blacklisted in January.

In 2019, the Trump administration sanctioned Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela seeking to force the resignation of President Nicolas Maduro, who it accuses of corruption, human rights violations, and rigging his 2018 re-election.

The administration on its last full day in office imposed sanctions on a different Alessandro Bazzoni over accusations he was tied to a network attempting to evade sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector.

Treasury also slapped sanctions on companies it said were tied to Bazzoni, including AMG S.A.S. Di Alessandro Bazzoni & C., with the same address as the Dolce Gusto restaurant and pizzeria in Verona, Italy. Records show the Verona-based Bazzoni owns both companies.

""They resolved the problem. I shouldn't be involved anymore,"" he said. ""It was a mistake ... thankfully it was all resolved in a couple of months.""

The SerigraphicLab di Bazzoni Alessandro, also listed by OFAC, did not reply to emailed requests for comment.

""At the end of the Trump administration they were doing a lot really, really fast with respect to Venezuela, Iran and China,"" said Tim O'Toole, a sanctions specialist at law firm Miller & Chevalier.

""When you move that fast, you tend to make mistakes,"" he added.

Italian restaurant owner mistakenly sanctioned by Trump,"An Italian restaurant owner accidentally put on a US sanctions blacklist before Donald Trump left the presidency has described the last couple of months as a “nightmare”.

In a case of mistaken identity, Alessandro Bazzoni, who owns a restaurant and pizzeria in the northern Italian city of Verona, had sanctions slapped against his company as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on blacklisted Venezuelan crude oil.

The US treasury also mistakenly blacklisted SeriGraphicLab, a graphic design company owned by another man called Alessandro Bazzoni, in Sardinia. The Sardinian business owner confirmed his company had been erroneously hit with sanctions in January but declined to comment further when contacted by the Guardian on Friday.

In 2019, Trump’s government imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), in an attempt to force the resignation of president Nicolás Maduro, who the US accused of corruption, human rights violations and rigging his 2018 re-election. On his last day in office, Trump sanctioned a network of oil firms and individuals tied to PDVSA.

Bazzoni, the restaurant owner, discovered his company’s name – AMG SAS Di Alessandro Bazzoni & C – was on the blacklist during a visit to his bank on 19 January, the day before Trump left office and the new US president, Joe Biden, was sworn in.

“When I heard that my current accounts had been blocked, I thought it was a joke,” Bazzoni told Corriere della Sera. “These are already difficult times for us restaurant owners, the last thing I needed was to have my accounts blocked.”

Bazzoni told the newspaper he solved the problem himself, “by entering my data on a special digital platform of the US government”. He added: “While I was at it I managed to get a visa until 2023.”

In an updated list on the US treasury’s website dated 31 March, both Italian companies were deleted from the blacklist. A treasury official told Reuters that the department realised the companies were owned by different individuals than the Bazzoni it blacklisted in January.

The restaurant owner claimed he didn’t receive an apology. “But it’s not a problem, the important thing is they removed my name from that list,” he told Corriere. “I thank the new American government for the efficiency with which it intervened.”",
Dinosaur-killing asteroid strike gave rise to Amazon rainforest,"The asteroid impact 66 million years ago led not just to the extinction of dinosaurs, but other forms of life

The asteroid impact that killed off the dinosaurs gave birth to our planet's tropical rainforests, a study suggests.

Researchers used fossil pollen and leaves from Colombia to investigate how the impact changed South American tropical forests.

After the 12km-wide space rock struck Earth 66 million years ago, the type of vegetation that made up these forests changed drastically.

The team has outlined its findings in the prestigious journal Science.

Co-author Dr Mónica Carvalho, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution in Panama, said: ""Our team examined over 50,000 fossil pollen records and more than 6,000 leaf fossils from before and after the impact.""

They found that cone-bearing plants called conifers and ferns were common before the huge asteroid struck what is now the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.

But after the devastating impact, plant diversity declined by roughly 45% and extinctions were widespread, particularly among seed-bearing plants.

While the forests recovered over the next six million years, angiosperms, or flowering plants, came to dominate them.

The structure of tropical forests also changed as a result of this transition. During the late Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs were still alive, the trees that made up the forests were widely-spaced. The top parts did not overlap, leaving open sunlit areas on the forest floor.

But post-impact, forests developed a thick canopy that allowed much less light to reach the ground.

So how did the impact transform the sparse, conifer-rich tropical forests of the dinosaur age into the rainforests of today, with their towering trees dotted with multi-coloured blossoms and orchids?

Based on their analysis of the pollen and leaves, the researchers propose three different explanations.

Firstly, dinosaurs could have kept the forest from growing too dense by feeding on and trampling plants growing in the lower levels of the forest.

Story continues

A second explanation is that falling ash from the impact enriched soils throughout the tropics, giving an advantage to faster-growing flowering plants.

The third explanation is that the preferential extinction of conifer species created an opportunity for flowering plants to take over.

These ideas, say the team, aren't mutually exclusive, and could all have contributed to the outcome we see today.

""The lesson learned here is that under rapid disturbances... tropical ecosystems do not just bounce back; they are replaced, and the process takes a really long time,"" said Dr Carvalho.",
"Nearly 2,000 New Yorkers have signed up to voluntarily escort Asian Americans to their destination amid hate crimes","Demonstrators march during a protest against Asian hate on Times Square in New York, the United States, March 20, 2021. Michael Nagle/Xinhua via Getty) (Xinhua/Michael Nagle via Getty Images

About 1,800 New Yorkers are volunteering with SafeWalks to escort Asian Americans from a public area.

The volunteers signed up in response to a surge in anti-Asian violence across both New York and the US.

Most recently, a 65-year-old Asian woman on Monday was assaulted in broad daylight on a New York City sidewalk.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

More than 1,800 New Yorkers have signed up to walk Asian Americans from any public area to their destination in an effort to combat and prevent anti-Asian violence and hate crimes.

Volunteers - many of whom speak Mandarin or Cantonese - are patrolling New York City neighborhoods like Chinatown and offering escorting services to anyone who asks for their help, Pix11 News reported.

The initiative is part of SafeWalks NYC, started in January after a string of attacks on women in the subway.

Volunteers, Pix11 News reports, give out flyers and wear bright safety belts. Each shift lasts two hours. A fundraiser to support the SafeWalks initiative has raised about $17,000 since it was posted to GoFundMe in February.

""We need to show our humanity. We can't let people hurt our seniors, our elders,"" volunteer Lisa Gold told Pix11 News.

Anti-Asian violence has surged

In recent weeks, there have been numerous anti-Asian attacks in New York City.

Just on Monday, a 65-year-old Asian woman was assaulted and yelled at on a New York City sidewalk. Her assailant, 38-year-old Brandon Elliot, kicked her to the ground and stomped on her head repeatedly while two doormen in a luxury apartment watched, security footage released by the police shows. When Elliot walked away, the doormen closed the apartment doors on her.

Nationally, recent stories related to anti-Asian violence also paint a grim picture.

Two weeks ago, police arrested a man in connection to a string of deadly shootings at three Atlanta-area massage parlors. Six out of eight of the victims were Asian women. Each attack had taken place at three massage parlors within an hour of one another on Tuesday.

Story continues

The shooter, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long from Woodstock, Georgia, suggested to police that the attacks were due to a sex addiction and were not racially motivated.

Multiple research studies have identified that the number of anti-Asian crimes and violence have spiked in the last year.

An analysis from Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, for example, found hate crimes overall decreased by 7% in 2020. That same study found that hate crimes specifically against Asian people rose by about 150%.

Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit tracking violence toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, released a report that identified nearly 3,800 instances of anti-Asian discrimination just in the past year.

And that's a very mild estimate, Stop AAPI hate said in its report.

""The number of hate incidents reported to our center represent only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur, but it does show how vulnerable Asian Americans are to discrimination, and the types of discrimination they face,"" the report says.

""Not enough has been done to protect Asian Americans from heightened levels of hate, discrimination and violence. Concrete action must be taken now,"" a press release from Stop AAPI Hate said. ""Anything else is unacceptable.""

Pedestrians in New York who want to request a safe escort or to volunteer can do so on the SafeWalks website, by emailing request@safewalx.com, or by DMing the @SafeWalksNYC handle on Instagram.

"'They said, keep going': migrants escorted back to Mexico without any explanation","They couldn’t work out quite where they were or where they were headed when the guards told them: “Keep going”.

They walked forward, as instructed, across an unfamiliar bridge and then suddenly they were in Mexico. Or, more accurately, back in Mexico. But 800 miles from where they had arrived in America.

In a chaotic situation at the southern border, US Customs and Border Protection agents are escorting migrants across the bridge that links downtown El Paso, Texas, with the adjacent city in Mexico, Ciudad Juárez, and expelling them from the US before they even know what’s happening.

One young mother just sat directly down on the sidewalk on the Mexican side of the international bridge linking the two cities and clutched her breastfeeding child to her as they huddled in cold, late March weather.

The child, no more than 18 months old, wearing a pink sweater and wrapped in a blanket first fed, then slept in her arms, unaware of the moments her bewildered mother would let a tear roll down her face.

At one point the woman covered the little girl’s hands with socks to stop her from crying due to the cold wind, despite the fact that the mother didn’t have a jacket of her own.

The sight is all too familiar in Juárez where dozens of migrants are being unceremoniously ejected from the US daily via a health protocol put in place by the Trump administration, known as Title 42, where migrants can be expelled to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the US.

Some undocumented people who cross the US-Mexico border are being admitted to the US to begin the asylum process, mainly unaccompanied minors and – theoretically – parents with very young children.

But most adult migrants and families currently being apprehended in the US are being expelled, though often not before being taken on a confusing and winding journey by the authorities on the American side.

“I came through Reynosa, I went to the wall and immigration picked us up,” 25-year-old Joel Duarte Mendez, who had originally traveled from Honduras, explained.

Story continues

Reynosa is at the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border, 754 miles from the cities of Juárez and El Paso at the extreme western end.

After crossing from Reynosa into Texas, Mendez and his two-year-old son, Hector, were briefly detained.

“Then they had us on a plane, then from there they put us on a bus and they just threw us here,” he said, pointing at the international bridge linking El Paso and Ciudad Juárez.

I said, ‘this is my opportunity to go’ and, well, that just simply wasn’t the case

American border agents had lined up the group of people after they got off the bus, took them part way across the bridge and then “they told us to ‘keep going’,” Mendez said.

He clung to Hector, the boy wrapped in a jacket obviously fit for his father, who was braving the cold weather in a T-shirt.

“I came with my son to give him a better life,” Mendez said.

Their trip from Honduras to the border took 12 days, he said. He owned a coffee farm and a home in Honduras, but both had been destroyed when massive hurricanes hit the country last November.

With the climate crisis believed to be causing stronger hurricanes, Mendez and Hector have effectively become climate refugees.

He used what was left of his money to pay for the trip, he said.

“We thought they were letting people with children five years and younger enter [the US], so I said, ‘this is my opportunity to go’ and, well, that just simply wasn’t the case,” he told the Guardian, dejectedly.

Title 42 was the last big piece of Donald Trump’s anti-immigration agenda that all but closed the US-Mexico border to the undocumented in the pandemic.

Joe Biden’s administration has rescinded Trump’s so-called Remain in Mexico policy, where migrants were forced to wait in often-dangerous border towns in Mexico while their claims for asylum from violent countries were processed in the US, sometimes taking years.

But for those without legal cases already underway in the US, Biden is continuing to use Title 42 while the pandemic lingers. Many crossing the border now are not even being officially processed into a border patrol or a Department of Health and Human Services facility, nor being turned over to family in the states to await a date with immigration court. They are just expelled into Mexico.

Mendez and the breastfeeding mother were among a group of approximately three-dozen migrants, almost all of them parents with young children, whom the Guardian saw being ousted from the US in recent days.

In Juárez, they were escorted into a gated area right off the bridge by the Mexican authorities, where journalists were not allowed to interview them.

But tears were visible, and many looked confused. The last mother in line had a young boy in her arms and another small child walking in front of her, both children were crying, while tears began streaming down the woman’s face when she realized she was in Mexico.

The group spent more than an hour in the gated area, before it was opened and several families spilled onto the streets of Juárez, left to fend for themselves.

Those who had contacts in the area asked for directions to taxis or called someone to pick them up, but others just sat on the street, unsure of their next move.

One father, who was not prepared to share his name, explained that since crossing briefly into the US they had never been told where they were or where they were going.

“We were there in the detention center waiting supposedly for them to contact a family member of ours [in the US] so they could come get us or send for us, but no, they lied to us,” he said.

The other father said: “It’s completely false that they would let us enter with small children.”

There are conflicting reports about why migrants are being transported from one end of the Texas border to the other, ranging from accounts about emergency shelters being full on either side of the border, especially because of Covid-19 restrictions that have closed many or shrunk capacity, to cruel tactics simply to deter migrants with an extra dose of desperation.

Nearby, another family: three children huddled around their mother, the father pacing back and forth. He confirmed that they had received no information from the agents who expelled them.

“Imagine what we go through from Honduras to get here: walking, hitchhiking, feeling hungry, suffering with our children,” he said.

“They took our photos, our fingerprints, kept us for three days, and then sent us here without signing anything.”

Mendez said he thought things would be different under the Biden administration.

He has a brother in Charlotte, North Carolina, who had been expecting to pick him and Hector up, when Mendez called him with the bad news.

“He reprimanded me for making the journey,” Mendez said. “I told him I had no other choice, I didn’t want us to starve.”

Now, he was stranded in Juárez, thousands of miles from home, with no money to return.",
"Fort Worth has a history with the Roosevelts - Teddy, Franklin, Eleanor. Elliott, too","They surely were the best-known cousins ever to come to Cowtown.

On April 8, 1905, Theodore Roosevelt became the first president to visit Fort Worth. The Fort Worth Telegram said that Roosevelt’s 75 minutes in Fort Worth were a “continuous ovation” as an estimated 30,000 people cheered as he was paraded through downtown, planted a tree at the Carnegie Library and gave a speech near the Al Hayne Memorial.

In 1910, just before Theodore’s fifth cousin, Franklin, was elected to the New York State Senate, Franklin’s wife Eleanor gave birth to son Elliott. Eleanor and Franklin were fifth cousins once removed.

A year later ex-President Theodore Roosevelt returned to Cowtown as the guest of honor at a breakfast hosted by cattleman Burk Burnett.

Fast-forward to March 1933. Now it was Franklin’s turn to be President Roosevelt. Son Elliott was now 23 and married. Just as FDR took office, Elliott was in Fort Worth to attend the Stock Show. He met socialite Ruth Googins, daughter of Swift packing plant manager Joseph B. Googins. A “friendship” developed.

Elliott’s wife Elizabeth took exception to the friendship and filed for divorce. Five days after the divorce was granted, Elliott and Ruth were married.

Elliott moved to Fort Worth, and the couple bought 1,300 acres south of Benbrook to establish Dutch Branch, their country home and stock ranch. Elliott became an executive of Texas State Network, whose flagship radio station was KFJZ.

The First Couple visited their son and daughter-in-law at Dutch Branch often. FDR made at least five trips to Fort Worth. Eleanor visited even more often.

When Eleanor came to town, she gave speeches, toured public schools and the Botanic Garden, attended the Stock Show.

When FDR came town he usually was met at the Texas & Pacific passenger station by Star-Telegram publisher Amon Carter, who hosted Roosevelt at his Shady Oak Farm or in his suite at the Fort Worth Club.

In 1936, Carter accompanied FDR to Marine Park, where FDR made a speech. Carter then showed FDR around the Frontier Centennial, which Roosevelt would officially open by remote control a month later.

Story continues

In 1937, Carter took FDR to Shady Oak Farm, where the leader of the free world fished for bass. The Star-Telegram reported that FDR caught a 3-pounder “but only after he spit on his hook like any schoolboy fishing in the creek.”

In 1938, Carter again greeted FDR at the train station. FDR gave a speech on his son’s radio station KFJZ.

Four years later, America was at war, and FDR was commander in chief. He made a tour of defense plants, including Fort Worth’s Consolidated Aircraft bomber plant, where he watched B-24s being assembled.

In 1943, America was still at war as FDR passed through town on another rail tour. Security at Dutch Branch was tight. The Star-Telegram wrote that “military police ‘rode fence’ on the ranch in armored cars.”

But the Cowtown-Roosevelts connection was severed in March 1944 when Ruth divorced Elliott.

A year later Ruth’s ex-father-in-law picked up his pen and unknowingly obliterated much of the physical evidence of the Cowtown-Roosevelts connection.

On March 2, 1945, six weeks before he died, FDR signed the Rivers and Harbors Act, which provided for construction of lakes to control flooding of the Trinity River. One of those lakes, Lake Benbrook, put much of the Roosevelts’ Dutch Branch under water.

"The Trump campaign reportedly cheated donors who thought they were making a one-time contribution, collecting recurring donations","Former President Donald Trump. Getty

The Trump 2020 campaign reportedly duped supporters into making recurring donations without their consent.

Donors, including cancer patients, who intended to make a one-time contribution ended up making more.

According to the New York Times, donations were automatically set to repeat when supporters got to the final stages of contributing.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

In what seemed to be an effort to bolster political contributions in the heat of the 2020 election against now President Joe Biden, the Trump 2020 campaign reportedly duped supporters into making recurring donations without their explicit or known consent.

An investigation of Federal Election Commission records done by the New York Times found that the Trump campaign, in the last two months of 2020, was forced to give hundreds of thousands of refunds in the amount of about $64 million. In total the campaign refunded $122 million, the newspaper said.

Many of these accidental repeat donors believed they were signing up to give a one-time contribution, the New York Times reported. Some of the victims of this scheme, like 63-year-old Stacy Blatt, were cancer patients who found themselves unable to pay bills and rent because of the repeated donations to the Trump campaign, the newspaper reported.

It started with an unusual and ""aggressive"" move: the addition of a small, bright yellow box on Trump's campaign donation portal in March 2020.

""Make this a monthly recurring donation,"" the text in the box read. The box had automatically been checked off as soon as donors landed on the page, the Times reported.

In order to avoid this recurring donation, donors had to manually opt out, the Times said.

Months later, the donation portal added a second pre-checked box. This time, the box automatically directed an additional contribution from the donor in honor of Trump's birthday in June, according to the Times.

Between June and September, contributions were pouring into the Biden campaign. So the Trump campaign ramped up its approach.

Story continues

By September, the text in the initial pre-checked box silently changed from ""monthly"" to ""weekly"" donation, according to the newspaper.

At this point, the Biden campaign had outraised Trump's by about $150 million, the Times reported. At the same time, Trump's own campaign finances were depleting.

Unrealizing Trump supporters began to make several repeated donations to the campaign over the course of a month.

Critics who spoke to the Times blasted the move.

""It's unfair, it's unethical and it's inappropriate,"" Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, said.

""It should be in textbooks of what you shouldn't do,"" London-based Harry Brignull, a user-experience designer familiar with manipulative digital marketing practices, told the paper.

Jason Miller, a spokesperson for Trump, told the Times: ""The fact we had a dispute rate of less than 1 percent of total donations despite raising more grass-roots money than any campaign in history is remarkable.""

The repeat donations became particularly rampant in the months between September and October, after the campaign employed the series of aggressive moves, the Times reported.

In total, the Trump campaign returned a staggering 10.7% of money secured through WinRed, the Republican Party's contribution portal. In contrast, the Biden campaign returned just 2.2% of the money raised through ActBlue, the Democratic Party's counterpart.

Trump supporters who had unwittingly donated their money to the campaign filed fraud complaints upon noticing unauthorized withdrawals, the Times reported.

"T.I., Tiny hit with sex abuse allegations from three more women","The women join a list of dozens of clients with similar claims being represented by Tyrone A. Blackburn

The number of accusers against Clifford “T.I.” Harris and Tameka “Tiny” Harris has gone up after more women came forward with claims of sex crimes.

Rapper T.I. and singer Tiny of Atlanta were accused of sexually assaulting three women in a report from Page Six.

The unnamed individuals are being represented by Tyrone A. Blackburn, the attorney representing a growing list of people with allegations against the couple. Dozens of her clients have made “a myriad of allegations of forced drugging, kidnapping, rape, and intimidation,” the outlet said.

The three women are not disclosing their identities at this time.

Blackburn’s spokesperson said one woman, who says she met the couple at a Miami nightclub in 2010, claims they “forced” her to swallow a pill and that Tiny later “undressed her and proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse” that was nonconsensual at a South Beach hotel, according to Page Six.

A second woman alleges that T.I. and a male friend drugged and raped her in Miami during the 2010 Memorial Day weekend, the report said. The third woman brought a story of being “drugged” and “sex trafficked” in multiple states, it said.

Multiple accusations against T.I. and Tiny have been made public over the past three months. In January, several women came forward with claims of sexual abuse by the pair, as previously reported by theGrio.

Blackburn stated that the “eerily similar” accusations date back as far as 2005 and as recent as 2018, all involving both T.I. and Tiny engaging in “sexual abuse, forced ingestion of illegal narcotics, kidnapping, terroristic threats and false imprisonment,” in tandem, according to The New York Times.

In addition to Miami, Blackburn says some of the accusers allege that abuse took place in Georgia and California. He says he is “speaking with investigators from multiple jurisdictions to pursue criminal charges” against T.I. and Tiny.

The Harrises have denied all allegations against them. According to Page Six, attorney Steve Sadow said on their behalf Friday:

“My clients’ position remains the same. We are still waiting for the anonymous accusers to reveal themselves to the public and the Harrises. Their continued unwillingness and refusal to do so compromises and undermines every single allegation being made.”

Some of T.I. and Tiny’s creative endeavors have been affected since the allegations became public. Deadline reported that VH1 temporarily suspended production of the couple’s reality show T.I. & Tiny: Friends & Family Hustle back in February. They had begun shooting the fourth season of the series in December.

In addition, Marvel Studios announced that T.I. would not be featured in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the third installment of their Ant Man franchise last month, according to The Hollywood Reporter. He appeared in both of the first two films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

John James Audubon's 'Carolina Parakeets.' Wikimedia CommonsIt was winter in upstate New York in 1780 in a rural town called Schoharie, home to the deeply religious Palatine Germans. Suddenly, a flock of gregarious red and green birds flew into town, seemingly upon a whirlwind. The townspeople thought the end of the world was upon them. Though the robin-sized birds left quickly, their appearance was forever imprinted on local lore. As author Benjamin Smith Barton wrote, “The more ignorant Dutch settlers were exceedingly alarmed. They imagined, in dreadful consternation, that it portended nothing less calamitous than the destruction of the world.” You and I know that the birds weren’t a precursor of mankind’s demise – but in a way, there was impending doom ahead. These birds were Carolina parakeets, America’s only native parrot. In February 1918, the last captive Carolina parakeet died, alone in a cage in the Cincinnati Zoo, the same zoo where the last captive passenger pigeon, named Martha, died four years earlier. The last “official” wild Carolina parakeet was spotted in Florida just two years later. Why did these birds go extinct? It remains a mystery. Given that parrots today are at greater risk for extinction than other major bird groups, is there anything scientists can learn from the Carolina parakeet? Unraveling parakeet mysteries Over the past six years, I’ve been collecting information about where the Carolina parakeet was observed over the last 450 years. The extinct Carolina parakeet, mounted on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Wikimedia Commons, CC BY I spent hours upon hours reading historical documents, travel diaries and other writings, ranging from the 16th century all the way into the 1940s. I’ve often become lost in the stories surrounding these parrot observations – from the first accounts of Europeans exploring the New World, to the harrowing tales of settlers traveling the Oregon Trail in the 1800s, to grizzled egg hunters scouring the swamps of Florida in the early 1900s. I also dug through natural history museum collections, looking at what many would just see as just some old, dusty, creepy dead birds. But I see them differently: beautiful in their own way, each with a story to tell. My goal was to unravel some of the lasting mysteries about the Carolina parakeet – like where it lived. Historically, people used to determine a species range by plotting the most extreme observations of that species on a map, drawing a polygon around them and called it a day. Because of this, people long thought Carolina parakeets lived from upstate New York all the way to Colorado and down to the Texas coast. But birds are often seen in areas where they don’t normally go. For instance, the range of the snowy owl – like Hedwig of “Harry Potter” fame – doesn’t really extend all the way to Bermuda, though one was once spotted there. The historic distribution of the extinct Carolina parakeet. The green area represents new understanding of where the eastern subspecies lived. The blue is where the western subspecies lived. The red line is based on a range map for the species published in 1891. Ecology and Evolution (2017), CC BY What’s more, scientists don’t know what really drove these parakeets to extinction. Some thought it was habitat loss. Some thought it was hunting and trapping. Some thought disease. A few even thought it was competition with nonnative honey bees for tree cavities, where the parakeets would roost and nest. Thanks to the data I compiled as well as cutting-edge machine learning approaches to analyze those data, my colleagues and I were able to reconstruct the Carolina parakeets’ likely range and climate niche. It turned out to be much smaller than previously believed. Generally, their range extended from Nebraska east to Ohio, south to Louisiana and Texas. The eastern subspecies lived mostly along the southeastern coast from Alabama, through Florida and up to Virginia. We were also able to confirm the longstanding hypothesis that the parakeets in the northwest part of their range migrated southeasterly in the winter, to avoid the blistering cold of the Midwest. Why it matters In a world that faces extinction on a scale not seen in the past 65 million years, some of you may wonder: Aren’t there more important things to study? While this may seem rather minor, some scientists consider the Carolina parakeet one of the top candidates for “de-extinction.” That’s a process in which DNA is harvested from specimens and used to “resurrect” extinct species, not unlike “Jurassic Park” (but way less action and decidedly less Jeff Goldblum). If someone were to spend millions of dollars doing all of the genetic and breeding work to bring back this species, or any other, how will they figure out where to release these birds? Given the effects of climate change, it’s no longer a given that scientists could release birds exactly where they used to be and expect them to flourish. Whether or not de-extinction is a worthwhile use of conservation effort and money is another question, best answered by someone other than me. But this is just an example of one potential use of this type of research. In many ways, the history of the Carolina parakeet’s decline parallels the history of American growth over the course of the 19th century. All that prosperity came with many terrible costs. As the U.S. expanded and remade the landscape to suit its needs, many native species lost out. Today, parrots face a serious threat of extinction. Parrot diversity tends to be highest in areas around the world that are rapidly developing, much like the U.S. during the 19th century. So whatever lessons the Carolina parakeet can teach us may be crucial moving forward. I continue to study Carolina parakeets, and other recently extinct species, in the effort to hear and relate these lessons. As cliche as it is to say, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Police officer killed and suspect shot dead after vehicle attack at US Capitol,"The New York Times

In October, Dr. Folasade May, an internist and public health researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, began a new workplace routine. Once a week, she would make the three-minute walk from her office to a campus coronavirus-testing site. After having her temperature checked and scanning a bar code on her phone, she would carefully swab the inside of her nose. Within a day or two, an email would arrive with her results. Week after week, her results came back negative. She continued to participate in the testing program even after being vaccinated, and she continued to test negative. And then, two weeks ago, an email landed in her inbox that stunned her: Her sample was positive for the coronavirus. The result — which turned out to be a false positive — briefly threw her life into chaos. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “Our whole family was turned upside down for an afternoon trying to figure out how to separate ourselves in our small house, trying to figure out who’s going to take care of the kids and who else did we expose,” May said. It is a situation that other families may soon find themselves in as mass coronavirus-screening programs ramp up in schools and workplaces. Some of these programs will make testing mandatory, but many others will rely on voluntary participation — or on people regularly self-administering tests in their own homes. The more people who participate, the more effective these programs will be at slowing the spread of the virus, and keeping tabs on it. But there are also clear disincentives to participating, ranging from inconvenience to anxiety over the consequences of a positive result, which can mean missing work, keeping a child home from school or days of quarantine. “There are huge implications of a positive COVID test that a lot of people are very wary of, especially if they’re feeling well,” said May, who studies health disparities and the barriers to accessing health care. “I don’t know that people are going to come out in droves to get it done.” Although coronavirus screening is new, researchers in several fields — including behavioral economics, implementation science and health psychology — have spent years studying how to encourage people to engage in other kinds of health-related behaviors, including cancer screening, HIV testing and vaccination. Some of these same strategies, they say, could help health officials design coronavirus-screening programs, or even vaccination programs, with better participation rates. “The reality is that people are going to have to wake up and decide whether this is something they intend to do on any given day or any given week,” said Harsha Thirumurthy, associate director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. “And we know — from lots of examples of people’s decisions to seek testing for other health conditions, or even people’s decisions to engage in other health-related behaviors — that people are constantly weighing the costs and benefits of engaging in these services.” Here are five ways that health officials say can help shift the calculus. Make It Easy Humans have a bias toward the status quo, a tendency to want to keep things as they are rather than shake them up. Many studies have shown that people are more likely to engage in various behaviors, from becoming an organ donor to enrolling in a 401(k) plan, when those behaviors are presented as the default choice. In a randomized clinical trial of nearly 5,000 emergency-room patients, researchers found that the share of patients who were willing to take a rapid HIV test climbed to 66% from 38% when the test was presented as a medical service they had to deliberately decline, rather than one they had to proactively ask for. Similarly, coronavirus-screening programs are more likely to see wider participation if they are opt-out rather than opt-in. “The more you ask people to put in their own cognitive efforts and behavioral efforts into this, the less likely they’re going to do it,” said Derek Reed, who directs the applied behavioral economics laboratory at the University of Kansas. And, of course, the actual testing process should be quick and convenient, experts say, with strategically located testing sites and streamlined procedures that allow people to easily incorporate testing into their routines. Ask People to Plan Experts also suggested asking people to think through the logistics of when and how they plan to get tested. Studies show that people who clearly formulate a plan for how they intend to accomplish something — whether it’s voting in an upcoming election or getting a flu vaccine — are more likely to follow through. One possibility, Reed said, would be to text people reminders of their testing appointments, and ask them to reply with, say, a 1 if they plan to walk to the appointment, a 2 if they plan to drive or a 3 if they plan to take the bus. “And then depending on the response, you just automatically ping back Google-map directions or a link to campus or community bus system maps or timetables,” he said. These kinds of nudges are likely to be most effective for people who are already motivated to get tested but may have trouble following through. “Often you need to nudge them a little bit by just removing frictions to get rid of these small costs,” said Sebastian Linnemayr, a behavioral economist at the RAND Corp., a think tank in California. Provide (the Right) Incentives Health officials could also reward people who participate in testing programs. “There probably needs to be some sort of incentive at the patient level,” May said. “We’ve seen the same thing in cancer screening. We’ve seen health insurers provide incentives to patients to participate in healthy lifestyles, to participate in screening measures.” But the specific incentives matter, and some studies suggest that people are more motivated by an opportunity to win a large reward than the guarantee of a smaller payout. In a November survey of 200 undergraduate students at the University of Kansas, Reed and his colleagues found that 70% of them said they would be willing to get tested if the university gave them a $5 gift card. But if the university instead entered them in a lottery, in which they had a 5% chance of winning $100, 88% said they would participate, said Reed, who shared his findings with the university. These kinds of lotteries may be effective because people tend to overestimate their chances of winning them. “The other part of it is that the lottery does introduce an element of fun or engagement in this idea that you’re part of something that other people are also participating in,” Thirumurthy said. Leverage Social Ties Peer pressure can be a powerful public health tool; research has shown, for instance, that college women are more willing to get the human papillomavirus vaccine if they believe that their peers are also doing so. Government, school and workplace leaders can help coronavirus testing become a social norm by making it public how many others are participating. “Then, send out that information over and over again: ‘Don’t be left out: 85% already got tested and are making the school a better place,’” Linnemayr said, adding, “It’s really important that you signal ‘This is an activity that we, as a community, value and reward.’” Health officials could also consider leveraging social networks more explicitly. In a randomized trial conducted in Kenya, Thirumurthy found that providing women with two HIV self-testing kits and encouraging them to give one to their male partners significantly increased the share of men tested for HIV. He is now working with colleagues to evaluate a similar program for the coronavirus, asking people to distribute self-testing kits to others in their social circles. “Who has the strongest ability to persuade you to test?” Thirumurthy said. “Is it going to be your employer or somebody in the community? Or is it going to be someone who is a close friend or a family member?” Support People Who Test Positive Even the cleverest nudges, however, will not be enough to persuade people to get tested if they think a positive result will have a devastating effect on their lives. A major barrier to HIV testing has been the fear among potential recipients that testing positive would cost them their friends, jobs, housing or health insurance. A positive coronavirus test doesn’t necessarily carry the same stigma, but it can still have serious ripple effects on people’s lives. “If it keeps you out of work and you can’t earn an income to support your family, that’s a nonstarter for a lot of people,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. So governments, employers and community organizations should do what they can to reduce the costs associated with testing positive, health experts said. That could mean providing paid leave or allowing employees to work remotely if they must quarantine; offering hotel vouchers so people have a safe place to isolate; or offering financial and food assistance. Such services can “soften the blow” of testing positive, Thirumurthy said. “There needs to be some type of safety net.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
Police officer killed in attack at U.S. Capitol; suspect dead,"A Capitol Police officer died Friday after a vehicle ""rammed"" into a barricade outside the U.S. Capitol complex. The suspect, who was shot by police, also died.

Acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said that an unidentified male suspect slammed his car into two officers, exited the car with a knife in his hand and ""lunged"" toward them. He was shot by police and taken into custody. All three were transported to the hospital, Pittman said.

""It is with a heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries,"" she said at a press briefing Friday afternoon. The other officer remains hospitalized.

Hours after the news conference, Pittman released a statement identifying the officer who had been killed as William Evans.

“It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the passing of Officer William 'Billy' Evans this afternoon from injuries he sustained following an attack at the North Barricade by a lone assailant,"" Pittman said in the statement. ""Officer Evans had been a member of the United States Capitol Police for 18 years. He began his USCP service on March 7, 2003, and was a member of the Capitol Division’s First Responder’s Unit. Please keep Officer Evans and his family in your thoughts and prayers.”

President Biden ordered U.S. flags to be lowered to half-mast to honor Evans, and released a statement.

""Jill and I were heartbroken to learn of the violent attack at a security checkpoint on the U.S. Capitol grounds, which killed Officer William Evans of the U.S. Capitol Police, and left a fellow officer fighting for his life,"" Biden, who was spending the weekend at Camp David, said. ""We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans’ family, and everyone grieving his loss. We know what a difficult time this has been for the Capitol, everyone who works there, and those who protect it.""

NBC News and the New York Times identified the suspect in the attack as Noah R. Green, 25. Based on the postings to a Facebook page purportedly belonging to Green which was taken down by the company Friday afternoon, he was a self-described admirer of Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam.

Pittman did not release the identity of the suspect.

""I just ask that the public continue to keep USCP and their families in their prayers,"" she said at Friday's news conference. ""This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol Police after the events of Jan. 6 and now the events that have occurred here today.”

Pittman said there was no indication that the suspect had made threats to any specific members of Congress, and ""there does not appear to be an ongoing threat"" at this time. The suspect was not known to police, and the attack does not appear to be related to terrorism, she said.

The incident began shortly after 1 p.m. ET, when the Capitol was placed on lockdown “due to an external security threat.”

A message played over the loudspeakers inside the Capitol complex said that all buildings were being locked down, and staff members were told they could not enter or exit the buildings. Video shared on social media showed a helicopter landing at the Capitol.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement Friday evening praising Evans and the Capitol Police.

""Today, America's heart has been broken by the tragic and heroic death of one of our Capitol Police heroes: Officer William Evans. He is a martyr for our democracy,"" Pelosi said.

Tensions in Washington have remained high in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died during that assault. Trump was impeached for his role in inciting the riot, and a number of resignations followed, including the Capitol Police chief and the sergeants-at-arms of both the House and Senate.

In early March, the House recessed early after Capitol Police said it had discovered evidence of a ""possible plot"" against legislators tied to the same far-right conspiracy theorists who helped spark the Jan. 6 violence.

Over the last few weeks political pressure has grown for Pelosi to remove protective fencing erected in the aftermath of the attack. Outer fencing around the Capitol came down over the weekend. An ""inner perimeter fence"" around the Capitol building is still in place.

Neither the U.S. Senate nor the House of Representatives was in session Friday, as Congress is in recess.

Pelosi ordered the flags at the Capitol to be flown at half-staff in honor of the deceased Capitol Police officer. ""The process of lowering the flags may take longer than usual because of the Capitol’s current lockdown status,"" said Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff.

The incident marks the first breach of Capitol security since Jan. 6, when a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the building in hopes of preventing lawmakers from certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. The attack resulted in the deaths of one Capitol Police officer and four rioters; it caused injuries to more than 140 other USCP officers.

“This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol Police after the events of Jan. 6,” Pittman said, “and now the events that have occurred here today.”

Capitol Police lifted a lockdown at the Capitol shortly after the press conference, saying the area was clear of any more threats. The crime scene, however, remains restricted.

The Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department is handling the investigation into the attack. Metro Chief Robert Conti said that as of now, “it does not appear that [the driver] is known to the Capitol Police or the Metropolitan Police Department” and that the attack “does not appear to be terrorism-related.”

Multiple media outlets later confirmed with law enforcement that the driver was 25-year-old Noah Green of Indiana.

The incident took place at the northwestern entrance of the U.S. Capitol, where senators and staff usually enter the building. The outermost fence that police set up in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack was removed last week, opening the area to public traffic.

Congress is on recess and lawmakers are out of town. Biden is at Camp David receiving information about the incident, the White House said.

“We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans’ family, and everyone grieving his loss,” Biden said in a statement. “We know what a difficult time this has been for the Capitol, everyone who works there, and those who protect it.”

The other officer injured in Friday’s attack, Biden added, is “fighting for his life.”

DeSantis declares emergency in Manatee; phosphate plant collapse ‘imminent’,"PALMETTO — Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Manatee County on Saturday as officials fear an “imminent” collapse at the old Piney Point phosphate plant could release a rush of polluted water into the surrounding area — and then into Tampa Bay itself.

The situation grew more dire Saturday as crews attempted to shore up a breach in a wall around a 480-million gallon wastewater reservoir that has been leaking for days. They used front-end loaders, excavators and dump trucks to pile dirt over the breach.

But then at 10:30 a.m. Saturday the on-site engineers “deemed the situation to be escalating,” said Manatee County Public Safety Director Jacob Saur. One containment wall shifted to the side, he said, signaling a structural collapse could happen at any time.

An “immense amount of water” could rush out in a sheet within seconds or minutes if berms at the site crack wide open, said acting county administrator Scott Hopes.

The flood could be several feet high and move through the immediate area, he said, before it flows toward the bay, where environmental advocates fear it could pose consequential harm to the ecosystem.

“If you have not evacuated please do so,” he told residents of the surrounding area. “We in the county are doing everything we can to mitigate the risk.”

There are about 15-20 houses in the evacuation zone. The Sheriff’s Office said all residents are believed to have left safely.

The DeSantis administration began sending pumps, cranes and other heavy equipment, Hopes said, because the county might need those tools in the event of a collapse.

“I don’t think we’re talking about a 30-foot tidal wave like when (Hurricane) Katrina went on the shore of Mississippi,” Hopes said.

But an engineer working at the site has previously described how an uncontrolled discharge could damage surrounding properties and a nearby highway.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers on Saturday closed U.S. 41 from 113th Street E in Manatee up to College Avenue in Hillsborough County. Manatee officials, meanwhile, increased the urgency of the evacuation notice they issued late Friday to nearby residents.

Story continues

A cell phone alert sent about 11 a.m. Saturday warned that a collapse could happen at any time. The county said anyone with questions about evacuating should call 3-1-1. Authorities said that they did not believe the situation posed a danger to a nearby jail.

To be safe, the Department of Environmental Protection relocated a command post it had set up at Piney Point to the Manatee County Emergency Operations Center in Bradenton.

The updates came less than a day after workers on the property, which is owned by a company called HRK Holdings, noticed a

“breakout of seepage” in a wall around the reservoir.

Overnight, Hopes said, county workers hoped to contain that problem using fill dirt and rock.

“The attempt was to kind of plug the hole in the dam,” he said. “They reached a point when they were about to celebrate, and it blew through.”

According to the county, between 2 and 3 million gallons of water are believed to be flowing from the breach per day. As of Saturday afternoon, county officials said, an estimate suggested there were about 380 million gallons of wastewater left in the reservoir.

All week, staffers at the old plant site across from Port Manatee have scrambled to drain wastewater from the pond. They want to lower the pressure created by the leak as it threatens to break apart dikes and berms.

Officials believe the issue could be the result of a tear in a plastic liner in the pond. As of Thursday, they have not confirmed the cause.

The old Piney Point plant has for decades loomed near the edge of Tampa Bay, threatening the region with an ecological disaster. Polluted discharges have happened before, some reaching a nearby aquatic preserve.

The site was home to a fertilizer manufacturing business before being abandoned. Left behind were long phosphogypsum stacks — berms that rise above the surrounding area and need to be monitored because of the material’s radioactivity. Phosphogypsum is a byproduct of processing phosphate.

Florida is home to about two dozen such stacks.

The wastewater being discharged this week, according to the state, contains phosphorus and nitrogen and is slightly acidic. At least 25 million gallons had been sent toward the bay, through Port Manatee, by Thursday morning.

Environmentalists fear nutrients from that water will fuel harmful algal blooms that could damage marine life in the estuary.

The reservoir, according to regulators, holds a mix of seawater from an old dredging project at the port, rainwater and polluted water left by the fertilizer industry.

Hopes said wastewater was flowing from the pond toward the port at a rate of 22,000 gallons per minute by Friday night. Officials are in a race to drain as much of the reservoir as possible, but if they need to empty it entirely to resolve the leak, that could take 10 to 12 days.

County leaders said Saturday that even if the 480-million gallon reservoir collapses, they hope other ponds on the site will not necessarily follow suit. But while fish live in the reservoir that is in immediate danger, Hopes said, some of the other water may be more contaminated.

HRK Holdings has recently been in charge of managing waste at the Piney Point site. It bought the property to create what it calls Eastport, leasing space for storage and industrial businesses across from Port Manatee.

For years before, the state was in charge of the site through a court-appointed receiver, having been stuck with the gypsum stacks and contaminated ponds when the plant’s last owner went out of business.

Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried has asked the governor to convene an emergency meeting of the state’s cabinet, so top officials can be briefed on the incident.

Manatee County has recently made Piney Point’s long-term closure a priority, amid warnings that the wastewater ponds are quickly approaching capacity. Commissioners are asking for state funding to install an injection well that would pump the water deep underground.

Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Noah Valenstein said Thursday that his agency would back that plan.

“The long history of Piney Point just needs to come to a close,” he told the Tampa Bay Times.

A spokeswoman for the agency said Saturday that the state will hold the site’s owners accountable for any damage to natural resources.

“Right now,” the spokeswoman, Shannon Herbon, said, “our top priority is ensuring the ceasing of the breach.”",
'Imminent' collapse of FL wastewater retention pond -officials,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued a State of Emergency for Manatee County on Saturday (April 3), due to the possible collapse of a dam containment wall.

CBS News reported that public safety officials in Manatee County, Florida ordered a complete evacuation of the Piney Point reservoir site and surrounding areas.

Officials say the dam wall -a phosphogypsum stack - collapsed further despite efforts to stop it.

Sauer said part of the containment wall shifted laterally, signifying that structural collapse could occur ""at any time.""",

NEW YORK — For New York City’s economy, the last 12 months have amounted to one long, brutal winter. The pandemic forced the shutdown of most of the city’s businesses, wiped out hundreds of thousands of jobs and kept away tens of millions of tourists. By many measures, the nation’s biggest city suffered the greatest losses and faces one of the longest and steepest climbs back. Shows will not return to Broadway stages until after Labor Day, and many workers will not begin commuting to the office and buying lunch at the corner deli for months, if they return at all. But for the first time since the city went on lockdown late last March, there are palpable signs of rebirth, fueled by a growing supply of COVID-19 vaccines and an impending gusher of federal aid to City Hall, the schools, the transit system, restaurants and theaters. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Shoots of the budding optimism pop up almost daily: The Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking Central Park called back workers for a reopening this week. Union Square Café, a popular Manhattan restaurant that had been closed for months, is feeding diners again. Fans were in the stands again when the New York Yankees opened their season in the Bronx on Thursday, though limited to one-fifth of the seats. The city’s outlook has improved as result of the latest stimulus bill, financial analysts say, which included about $6 billion in direct aid to the city government, $6.5 billion to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and $4 billion to the city’s public schools. “There’s a lot of cash that’s going to come in fairly quickly here,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It’s going to provide big pops to places that have been more or less shut down.” The federal aid will help solve some of the city’s biggest short-term problems, including huge drops in revenue from property and sales taxes and fares that the MTA, which runs the subway, buses and two commuter rails, is heavily dependent on. Still, the road to full recovery will be long and steep, business leaders and analysts say. Entire industries, including the arts, hotels and restaurants, were decimated, with thousands of businesses closing for good. Tourism, a pillar of the economy, is years away from rebounding, according to forecasts. And many companies are making at least some remote work a permanent feature, raising questions about the future of Manhattan without legions of office workers. “The city still has a ways to go,” said Ana Champeny, director of city studies for the Citizens Budget Commission. “You’ve got to get commuters back in Midtown and downtown, the business district. You’ve got to get restaurants and theaters reopened.” The infusion of federal aid has provided some reason for hope. The MTA has gone from threatening to sharply reduce service and lay off workers to promising to restore 24-hour subway service, which was suspended during the pandemic. Many restaurants that struggled to survive through a monthslong ban on indoor dining can try to recoup losses and the costs of adapting to pandemic restrictions. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader from New York, said the aid that will flow to New York state and its residents from the stimulus bill, known as the American Rescue Plan, amounted to nearly $100 billion. Mayor Bill de Blasio will lay out a plan for spending the direct aid when he presents his budget in April, said a spokeswoman, Laura Feyer. The mayor said the aid would enable the city “to finally overcome the massive revenue loss and to serve our people, keep our workforce strong, bring our city back.” The direct local aid “can put the city on solid fiscal footing,” said Champeny, though the city still faces large budget deficits in future years. “It is an incredibly generous package that will definitely start the rebuild.” The rebuild faces formidable challenges. The New York metropolitan area lost more than 1 million jobs in 2020, close to double the Los Angeles area’s loss and triple the Chicago area’s, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The city’s official unemployment rate rose to 12.9% in February, more than double the national rate, which was 6.2% in February and fell to 6% in March.) The job losses fell harder on those who were clinging to the lower rungs of the city’s economic ladder. Low-paying jobs that cannot be done from home accounted for most of the losses, and many may not come back for years, if ever, economists said. New York was especially vulnerable to the pandemic’s economic pummeling because of its heavy reliance on tourists and business travelers to fill hotel beds and seats in restaurants, theaters and stadiums. The number of foreign visitors to New York is not expected to reach its 2019 level before 2025, according to the city’s tourism promotion agency. New York’s office towers are still largely empty, and the exodus of office workers from Manhattan — many of whom are not expected to return until the last half of the year — has crippled merchants and significantly reduced the value of much of the city’s commercial real estate, which will translate into a big drop in sales and property tax revenue. The city’s Independent Budget Office projected that the city’s recovery would remain “fragile and tentative for many more months.” Though a snapback in hiring this year and next would replace about 400,000 of the jobs the city lost, the budget office said that by the end of 2024 New York would still not have as many jobs as it did before the pandemic started. More than 200 of the city’s 700 hotels remain closed, leaving thousands of workers still unemployed, said Vijay Dandapani, chief executive of the Hotel Association of New York City. “My industry fell off a cliff on March 22 last year,” he said. Many hotel operators have received no federal aid during the pandemic, and nearly half are in default on their mortgages, Dandapani said. More than 40 hotels have fallen behind on their property tax payments to the city, which could put them in “a downward spiral” that they cannot escape, he added. But even the beleaguered hotel business is seeing glimmers of recovery. The Mandarin Oriental rehired more than 100 members of the Hotel Trades Council union for its reopening on Thursday, the hotel’s manager, Susanne Hatje, said. The Mandarin is offering discounted rates starting at $716 per night, 20% below prepandemic prices. The nearby Park Hyatt also reopened on Thursday, and other hotels are expected to join the trend as tourists trickle back. During the week that ended March 20, the city’s hotels had an occupancy rate of 50.8%, the highest in more than a year, according to STR, an industry research firm. Tourism may start to pick up slightly by late summer if fans return to the stands at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens. And if delegates come back to Manhattan in September for the United Nations General Assembly, hotels may fill more rooms. The city’s tourism promotion agency, NYC & Co., has forecast that the number of visitors will climb to 38 million this year, up from about 23 million in 2020, but still down about 40% from a record high level in 2019. Despite the city’s precarious situation, E.J. McMahon, founder of the Empire Center, a conservative research group, said he was wary about the extraordinary amount of federal aid flowing to the region. The pandemic’s impact on New York’s economy appears to be much deeper and longer lasting than the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack two decades ago, he said. “There’s going to be a hangover from this, a significant hangover.” Still, McMahon questioned, “What it is that government can do to actually re-create the economy?” Many of the lost jobs, such as cleaning hotel rooms and serving food, did not require much skill or extensive training, he said. “There’s a lot of potential here for problems and abuse of the money.” But James A. Parrott, an economist at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School, argued that the city should use some of the federal aid to retrain workers who have lost their jobs. “Tens of thousands of jobs will permanently disappear, and the city needs to do more to preserve the businesses that are trying to hang on,” Parrott said. “The city has never had a challenge on this scale before.” The restaurant business is one important part of New York’s private-sector economy that will benefit directly from the stimulus bill. The bill included more than $28 billion for restaurants across the nation that have been among the businesses worst hit by the pandemic’s economic fallout. A sizable chunk of that aid will likely go to New York’s restaurants because they experienced some of the longest and most severe restrictions, said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group. A recent survey by the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, estimated that 5,000 restaurants in the city had shut down for good during the pandemic. “This will save countless restaurants and jobs,” Rigie said. “It’s horrible that restaurants had to wait a year for this funding, but better late than never.” While it may take some time, “the city is going to see a big revival,” Zandi said. “It’s going to come roaring back.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
Fox News is silent on bombshell reports of Matt Gaetz's alleged sexual misconduct and possible sex trafficking of a minor,"Rep. Matt Gaetz appears on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" to address a DOJ investigation into him. Fox News

Fox News is ignoring reports that GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz is under FBI investigation for sex trafficking.

Since Wednesday evening, media watchdogs report, the network hasn't mentioned Gaetz's name a single time.

Gaetz is a frequent Fox guest and top Trump defender.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Fox News is ignoring perhaps the most shocking story in US politics this week.

On Tuesday night, The New York Times broke the news that Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and frequent Fox News guest, is under FBI investigation over whether he had sex with a 17-year-old girl and violated federal sex trafficking laws. Gaetz has not been charged in connection to the investigation.

Soon after the story broke, Gaetz appeared on Fox host Tucker Carlson's show to defend himself against what he called ""false sex allegations,"" which he claimed were part of a larger extortion plot targeting his family. Afterwards, Carlson told his audience the conversation was ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted.""

Since then, news outlets have reported a series of additional bombshell allegations about Gaetz's misconduct. On Thursday, CNN reported that Gaetz had shown nude photos and videos of women he claimed he'd had sex with to fellow lawmakers.

On Thursday night, The Times published another bombshell report in which it detailed how Gaetz and his associate, a Florida politician who's been indicted on federal sex trafficking and other charges, allegedly recruited and paid women for sex and used drugs. On Friday, a longtime aide Gaetz aide, communications director Luke Ball, resigned.

Since Wednesday evening, media watchdogs report, the network hasn't mentioned Gaetz's name a single time as of midday on Friday.

A spokesperson for Fox declined to comment on the record.

Since the scandal broke, Fox has publicly distanced itself from Gaetz. A network spokesperson denied the congressman's recent claim that he'd discussed a potential job with Fox after leaving office.

""No one with any level of authority has had conversations with Matt Gaetz for any of our platforms and we have no interest in hiring him,"" the spokesperson told multiple media outlets.

"New Matt Gaetz Bombshell Report Alleges Drugs, Sex, Money... And Receipts","The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Rep. Matt Gaetz says he will not resign from office amid a growing sex-trafficking scandal,"The Guardian

The fact that this guy is a sitting member of Congress shows just how low we set the bar for our (male) politicians Matt Gaetz: a man who has spent his career reveling in scandal rather than actually doing his job. Photograph: Michael Brochstein/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock A guide to navigating ‘Gaetzgate’ The Matt Gaetz story increasingly reads like a script written by a pervert high on a cocktail of ADHD meds and MDMA. Even if you’ve been following the scandal-prone Republican congressman’s latest controversy closely it’s hard to keep track of what on earth is happening. So here’s a guide to navigating the saga far. First and foremost, it has been established that Gaetz is under federal investigation for sexual misconduct. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the justice department (DoJ) is investigating whether Gaetz, 38, “had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her to travel with him”. If these allegations are accurate, then Gaetz could have violated federal sex trafficking laws. According to the Times, the allegations are part of a broader investigation into a political ally of Gaetz’s named Joel Greenberg, a Florida tax collector who was indicted last year on charges including the sex trafficking of a child. Greenberg also reportedly misused public funds to buy servers for a cryptocurrency company as well as weapons, ammunition and a drone. As you do. After the Times broke the story, Gaetz confirmed to Axios that he was under federal investigation for sexual misconduct and is worried about being criminally charged. Rather predictably, however, he insists that he’s actually the victim in all of this and has said “no part of the allegations” against him are true. Gaetz, who is currently engaged to a woman 12 years younger than him, claimed that he used to be a “generous” partner in his single days and paid for flights and hotel rooms. “I think someone is trying to make that look criminal when it is not,” he said. Why would someone want to do that? Well, in a statement released on Tuesday Gaetz said he and his family have “been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DoJ official seeking $25m while threatening to smear my name”. He claims the investigation is a cover for extortion and suggested that it was linked to the “Biden White House”. Which is a weird claim considering the New York Times reports that the investigation into Gaetz, a Donald Trump loyalist, was opened in the final months of the Trump administration under then attorney general William Barr. Here’s where things get really weird. According to the Washington Post, a couple of grifters who learned of the investigation against Gaetz decided to use the opportunity to extort the congressman’s father. They reportedly wrote to Don Gaetz and said that there were pictures of his son with “child prostitutes”; they would help Gaetz, however, if he gave them a large sum of money. The idea, dubbed “Project Homecoming”, was that they’d use that money to locate and rescue Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who was kidnapped in Iran back in 2007. Levinson, who is presumed dead, would be heroically rescued by Gaetz; Joe Biden would be so thrilled with the rescue that he’d pardon Gaetz. The bottom line? It seems plausible that Gaetz really is caught up in a bizarre extortion plot. However, there are two possible scenarios here. Scenario one: Gaetz did nothing wrong and is telling the truth about being the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy orchestrated by his political rivals that kicked off when Gaetz’s buddy Trump was in power. Scenario two: there is no big conspiracy against the congressman; a couple of opportunists simply pounced on the investigation against him as a way to make money. I don’t know about you but the second scenario seems rather more plausible to me. Ultimately, it’s important not to let all the drama distract from the real issue here, which is that a sitting congressman seems to be under investigation for sex trafficking and has links to a guy who has already been indicted for sex trafficking. It doesn’t really look good for Gaetz. It looks so bad, in fact, that Gaetz’s communications officer abruptly left his job on Friday. While the allegations against Gaetz are still being investigated, it’s worth noting that Gaetz has faced accusations of disturbing sexual conduct before. In January 2020 Chris Latvala, a Republican congressman, tweeted that Gaetz “created a game where members of the FL House got ‘points’ for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists, and married legislators”. Gaetz also reportedly bragged of his sexual exploits and showed other lawmakers nude photos of women he’d slept with. According to CNN, he showed his colleagues these photos while he was at work. Gaetz, by the way, was also the only lawmaker to vote against a bipartisan anti human-trafficking bill. A number of his colleagues have also spoken out about “love of alcohol and illegal drugs, as well as his proclivity for younger women”. I don’t know exactly what Gaetz has or hasn’t done, but I do know he’s spent his career reveling in scandal rather than actually doing his job. He even joked with Elon Musk last week about how a scandal involving him would be called GaetzGate. The fact that this guy is a sitting member of Congress boggles the mind. It shows just how low we set the bar for our (male) politicians. Boy, do I ever regret giving Gaetz the benefit of the doubt I should state for the record that I wrote an article last year saying I thought it was unfair that people were insinuating Gaetz had an inappropriate relationship with his t “son”, Nestor. And there is no evidence, to be clear, that the relationship is inappropriate. However I have certainly learned my lesson: never ever even vaguely defend Matt Gaetz. The rise of granfluencers Two octogenarians went viral after modelling their grandson’s gender-neutral fashion line at Paris fashion week. They’re part of a growing trend of “granfluencers”. Ivanka’s women’s empowerment scheme not very empowering after all The Government Accountability Office has issued a very unflattering report about Ivanka Trump’s women’s empowerment initiative. I am you are just as shocked about this as I am. How Lady Mary Wortley Montagu’s bold experiment led to smallpox vaccine Edward Jennner gets the credit for inventing the smallpox vaccine in 1796. Turns out he was building on a woman’s work: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had successfully inculcated her three-year-old daughter several decades before Jenner’s experiments. Of course, she got zero credit for her ideas at the time and was denounced as an “ignorant woman”. Andrew Cuomo is fighting to erect a skyscraper called Penn15 in Manhattan I wish this was a joke but it’s not. The New York governor is facing a number of scandals but refuses to resign and is reportedly obsessed with this real estate project. Perhaps because the people behind it have given a lot of money to his campaigns. The week in pawtriarchy The only person who might be worse at their job than Cuomo is the genius who reportedly tried to pass off a golden retriever as a lion at a Chinese zoo. The zookeeper may have been inspired by an incident a few weeks earlier at another zoo in China where a supposed wolf’s cage housed a rottweiler. Which might be funny were it not for the fact that many Chinese zoos are notoriously cruel.",
Vaccine passports: How to prove you've gotten your COVID-19 shots for travel and avoid scams,"Beth Marcus wants a vaccine passport. She's had both of her shots but can't prove it. Unless she can, she's afraid she may not be allowed to visit Europe.

How do you get a vaccine passport?

The clinic where she received her shots issued a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – a small, white paper card where she recorded both her vaccinations. Marcus, a retired finance worker from Frederick, Maryland, took a picture of the card, so she could show it to anyone who asks. She suspects it's not enough.

""I would like more substantial proof,"" she says.

New York launches nation's first 'vaccine passports': Others work on similar ideas, but many details must be worked out

Will you need a COVID-19 'vaccine passport' to travel? Here's what they are and how they might work

This Vaccination Record Card from the CDC is the only proof of vaccination most Americans have after getting their COVID-19 shots.

Israel and Europe have taken the lead on developing a secure digital immunity certification. You may be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine passport by enrolling in one of the tests underway. In the meantime, you have a few imperfect options for showing you received your shots.

What is a vaccine passport? How would it work for travel?

""There's no vaccine passport in the United States,"" says Peter Vlitas, senior vice president of airline relations for Internova Travel Group. But we're close. The most promising one is the IATA Travel Pass. It's being tested among 22 airlines, and the airline trade organization expects to release it this month. It will be limited to air travel and border crossings.

Vaccine passports: The documents should be free, private and secure, White House says, but who will issue them?

TripActions' app-based health passport, a private initiative that launches early next month, will allow travelers to upload and store all necessary documentation required for domestic and international travel within a centralized hub.

The only vaccine passport in widespread use is Israel's Green Pass. The certificate, available as either a smartphone app or paper ID using a QR code for authentication, allows users to prove their vaccine status in Israel. Passholders use their credentials to visit the gym, pool, restaurant or participate in any other activity previously restricted because of COVID-19. Only Israeli residents qualify for a Green Pass, but Israel is in discussions with other countries to have the passes accepted outside the country, according to the Ministry of Tourism.

Story continues

The European Union is developing a Digital Green Certificate to prove people have had their shots and ""facilitate safe free movement"" inside the EU during the pandemic. The vaccine ID, which is likely to be available by June, will be available in digital or paper format.

In the USA, airlines have been pushing the government to create a vaccine passport for Americans, saying verifiable testing of vaccination data is ""critical to the return of travel.""

New York launched a version of a vaccine passport. The first-in-the-nation certification, called the Excelsior Pass, will be accepted at dozens of event, arts and entertainment venues statewide.

Patchwork problems: Airlines ask White House to develop standardized COVID-19 travel 'passports'

There are so many vaccine passport proposals that it's almost impossible to track all of them, but they all have one thing in common: They are not officially recognized, at least for now.

What should travelers do?

""There's a rush to deliver a digital vaccine passport solution, as many countries will make it mandatory to have proof of vaccinations and actively court vaccinated travelers,"" says Rajeev Shrivastava, CEO of VisitorsCoverage.

How do you prove you're vaccinated? Here are your options:

Think about laminating your COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card

That's what Paula Miller and her husband did.

""We felt that they would hold up better when we need to present them while traveling domestically or internationally,"" says Miller, a retired teacher from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

Like Marcus, she'd prefer the real thing.

""We have flights to Paris scheduled for November,"" she says. ""I hope that issue is resolved by then.""

The biggest problem with lamination: The document isn't secure. (You can buy a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card online for about $20 and fill it in yourself.) If boosters are needed, a laminated card might be a problem. But until we have a vaccine passport, this may have to do.

Fill in your WHO Yellow Card

If you received shots for a previous international trip, you have a World Health Organization (WHO) Yellow Card (International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis). ""The Yellow Card has been the de facto standard for proving international vaccination compliance for decades,"" says Warren Jaferian, the dean for Endicott College's Office of International Education in Beverly, Massachusetts.

I have a Yellow Card from previous trips, and when I received my shots, I asked the clinic to record the vaccines. I had to ask a supervisor, but he did. There are two issues with the Yellow Card. They are scarce (some have reported they're unavailable), and they are not secure. An e-Yellow Card is reportedly under development.

Fly on a Travel Pass airline

If you can book a ticket on one of the airlines testing the IATA Travel Pass, you may be able to access the IATA vaccine passport. Those carriers include Virgin Atlantic, Japan's ANA, Emirates and Singapore Airlines. Travel Pass is still being evaluated, so there's no assurance that your digital passport will work on your next flight or that it will be accepted anywhere.

Until there's a real vaccine passport, you'll need to get creative. Marcus, who plans to visit the Baltics next year, created her own makeshift vaccine ID.

""I made a color copy of the original and had it laminated at Staples,"" she says. ""I didn't laminate the original because I want it to be possible for boosters, if needed, to be recorded on the same document.""

She hopes it will work. Timing is everything when it comes to certifying vaccination. At the rate things are going, the pandemic will end before America has a real vaccine passport.

Avoid these vaccine passport traps

Don't pay for it. A legitimate vaccine ID is free. Both the Israeli and proposed European version cost nothing. There are some unofficial vaccine IDs in the USA that make you pay for certification. They are not legit.

Make sure it's secure. You can buy a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card or a World Health Organization Yellow Card online and fill it out. But it's not a secure record of your vaccination, and it probably won't work when the real thing comes along. Avoid any vaccine passport that doesn't have a QR code or a way to authenticate your vaccine status securely.

Find out if it's accepted. Several cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Virgin Voyages, Crystal Cruises and American Cruise Lines, announced they will begin to require proof of vaccination for passengers (at least on some of their voyages), though they haven't specified which records will be accepted. Your travel adviser can tell you what type of proof will be accepted by the cruise line. Don't take chances – get the right vaccine passport, or you could be left high and dry.

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling.

Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot.

But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch.

On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen.

The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch.

Biden says he is 'heartbroken' and orders flags at the White House to be flown at half-staff in response to Capitol Police officer death,"The Daily Beast

GoFundMeThe death of a 13-year-old boy, who dreamed of joining the police but was gunned down by a cop in an “armed confrontation” this week, has horrified the crime-weary city of Chicago, prompting demands for answers from the mayor on down.The Cook County Medical Examiner confirmed to The Daily Beast that Adam Toledo died of a gunshot wound to the chest on Monday. His death, which occurred after a confrontation with Chicago police in Little Village, has been classified as a homicide.The boy’s family, community leaders, and even Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot are demanding police release the body-camera videos of the incident. The officer involved in the shooting has been put on desk duty for at least 30 days pending an investigation.“Adam was a seventh-grade student at [Gary Elementary] School, enjoyed sports, and was a good kid. He did not deserve to die the way he did,” the Toledo family said in a Friday statement.Cops Now Say UVA Grad Slain by Police Was ‘Brandishing a Handgun’The family said Adam was killed “due to the unreasonable conduct of a Chicago Police Officer” and they would “seek justice for this reprehensible crime.” They added that they were only notified of Adam’s death two days after he was killed.“We are confident that the Chicago Police Department and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability will conduct a thorough investigation, that there will be transparency, and that Toledo Family will find out the truth of what happened to Adam.”Police said the incident began at around 2:35 a.m. on Monday when officers responded to a call of “multiple shots fired in the 200 block of S. Sawyer.” When they arrived, they found two males—later identified as Toledo and 21-year-old Ruben Roman Jr.—“in a nearby alley” and at least one was armed. Police said the armed person ran from the scene, prompting officers to start a foot pursuit that ended in an “armed confrontation.”“The officer fired his weapon striking the offender in the chest,” a Chicago Police Department spokesperson said in a statement. “A weapon was recovered and the offender was pronounced deceased on scene.”Officers observed two subjects in a nearby alley, one subject fled on foot which resulted in an armed confrontation. One subject shot and killed. 2nd subject in custody. Gun recovered on scene. COPA investigating. #ChicagoPolice pic.twitter.com/bn7o2deAGS— Tom Ahern (@TomAhernCPD) March 29, 2021 Police said Roman was taken into custody and charged with misdemeanor resisting or obstructing a peace officer. According to court records, Roman pleaded guilty in 2019 to possessing an illegal gun and was sentenced to probation.In a Thursday interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, the teenager’s mother, Elizabeth Toledo, said she last saw her son the day before the shooting when they attended a memorial service for a relative. She said she didn’t know what prompted the incident and she “just wants answers about what really happened.”“I haven’t heard from cops since yesterday when they knocked on my door,” she said on Thursday.The mother-of-four said her son was “always happy,” loved animals, and had a dream of joining the police.“He wanted to be a cop when he grew up,” Toledo said. “And next thing you know, a cop took his life.”Monday’s tragic shooting comes as Chicago battles a siege of homicides and shootings. According to the Chicago Tribune, 134 people have been killed this year alone, which is higher than the same period in 2020. Last year had already been the worst year for gun-related homicides on record, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.Amid outrage over Toledo’s death, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown released a statement on Thursday, calling it a “tragedy” and insisting he adamantly wanted to release body-cam footage.“My greatest fear as the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department has been a deadly encounter between one of our own and a juvenile, especially given the recent rise in violent crimes involving juveniles throughout our city,” Brown said. “Unfortunately, this fear became a reality earlier this week. Any loss of life is tragic, especially when it involves youth. On behalf of the entire Chicago Police Department, I extend my condolences to the family of the juvenile.”The shooting is being investigated by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability. While the COPA initially said the bodycam footage could not be released without a court order because of the Juvenile Court Act, which prohibits them from sharing videos of minor victims, the agency said Friday the footage will be made public. “COPA has determined that certain provisions of state law intended to protect the confidentiality of juvenile records do not prohibit the agency’s release of material related to its investigation,” the agency said in a statement. It added that the act “does not bar publication of the body-worn and third-party video camera footage the agency has obtained to date.”Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot took to Twitter on Thursday to urge the release of the footage, adding that she “can only imagine the incredible pain this boy’s parents are experiencing at this moment.”“Because his family and the public will undoubtedly have many questions, we must release any relevant videos as soon as possible,” Lightfoot said, noting that it is among “the most complex cases that COPA investigates” and “transparency and speed are crucial.”“We must ask ourselves how our social safety net failed this boy leading to the tragic events in the early hours of Monday morning,” she said.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"The wife of the leader of the Oath Keepers is asking for $30,000 in public donations to help her escape her 'weird' marriage","Stewart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, on February 28, 2021 in Fort Worth, Texas. Aaron C. Davis/The Washington Post via Getty Images

The wife of the leader of the Oath Keepers is asking for $30,000 in donations to fund their divorce.

The divorce of Tasha Adams and Stewart Rhodes has been pending for more than three years.

Adams said the current ""spotlight"" on her husband emboldened her to seek financial help.

The estranged wife of the leader of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers has launched a GoFund Me page to help pay for her divorce, BuzzFeed reported this week.

Tasha Adams, 48, is asking for $30,000 in donations to pay off overdue legal bills and hire a new attorney to complete her divorce from Stewart Rhodes, which has been pending for more than three years.

""It's certainly not easy to find a lawyer willing to go head to head against a person who is not only a graduate of Yale Law but also commands their own private army, as well as having access to a team of equally infamous attorneys surrounding him,"" Adams wrote on the GoFundMe. ""Nonetheless, I am confident that somewhere out there is an advocate willing to be my huckleberry.""

Adams also said that she had been dropped as a client from her former law firm because she couldn't pay them. She said she had felt encouraged to ask for the funds after Rhodes and his group were thrust into the national spotlight following the deadly Capitol riots.

""For obvious reasons, I am very very hesitant to go public with this, but after a whole lot of thought, I feel I just can not move forward any other way. I am feeling a bit emboldened by the spotlight now on the STBX, and without going into specifics I'm hoping that keeps anything too crazy from happening,"" she wrote on the GoFundMe.

""Though I can't talk about the details of my marriage here,"" she wrote on her GoFundMe page, ""I can tell you that it was likely about exactly what you're picturing, but probably quite a bit weirder.""

Last month, the DOJ charged six people in the Oath Keepers movement in connection with the Capitol riot. Another nine people associated with the extremist group were charged with conspiracy to obstruct Congress.

Several Oath Keepers were seen providing personal security for Roger Stone and others close to Former President Donald Trump on the Capitol riots' day.

Rhodes was outside the Capitol on January 6 but did not enter it, BuzzFeed reported. However, he did exchange a phone call with someone helping to lead a group of other Oath Keepers members inside the building, prosecutors alleged last week, according to the Washington Post. Rhodes is not accused of any wrongdoing.

Rhodes, an Army veteran, founded the Oath Keepers in 2019. The organization recruits active and former military and law enforcement officers who swear an oath to uphold the US Constitution.

Adams and Rhodes, who met in Las Vegas, married in 1994 and have six children together, according to Buzzfeed News.

The fundraiser was posted five days ago and has so far raised $3,907.

Trump might have 'found' the votes he needed to win Georgia under state's new election law,"What if Georgia election officials had somehow found those nonexistent votes that then-President Donald Trump pressured them to “find” to overturn his narrow loss in the Peach State? What if there hadn’t been a secretary of state with not only the spine but the authority to make sure the election was immune from partisan cheating?

It would have been a devastating loss for democracy, that’s what. And it would have been much easier to pull off had Georgia’s brand-new election law been in place.

Thanks to a somewhat overlooked provision in Georgia’s new restrictive voting law and similar measures being pushed in more than a half-dozen other GOP-controlled legislatures, the skids are becoming better greased for Trump-style election tampering in the future. These attempts to subvert the will of voters must be stopped.

Related: GA Rep arrested, dragged while gov signed GOP voting bill

What is behind the law

Tucked inside the new Georgia elections law is a measure that shifts a significant amount of election oversight power from the secretary of state and county election boards to the legislature. The measure removes the elected secretary of state as chair of the state election board and replaces him or her with an appointee of the Republican-run legislature.

Such a coincidence! Just a few months after Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says “no” to magical vote-finding, the legislature takes a chunk of power and authority from his office and shifts it to someone of their choosing — and, we can only assume, more likely to do their bidding.

Voting booths on Oct. 22, 2018, in Tampa, Florida.

The law doesn’t just change who picks the chair. Now, the majority of the board’s members will be legislative appointees, and the board gains ominous new power: the ability to remove and replace election officials administering the vote at the level where the real elections work happens — the county level.

Let’s say the state board does not like the way vote-counting is going in heavily Democratic Fulton County. Under the new law, the board can fire those in charge and plop in a new boss more to its liking.

Story continues

“After the November election last year,” Gov. Brian Kemp said as he signed the bill into law, “I knew … that significant reforms to our state elections were needed.”

Given that no one has produced evidence of large-scale cheating, fraud, counting dead people’s votes, or losing living people’s votes, I think we know what Kemp sees as needing “reform”: Democrat Joe Biden's victory in previously red Georgia.

“Republicans are brazenly trying to seize local and state election authority in an unprecedented power grab,” says voting rights leader Stacey Abrams, former Democratic leader in the Georgia State House. The new law, she says, is “intended to alter election outcomes and remove state and county election officials who refuse to put party above the people … Had their grand plan been law in 2020, the numerous attempts by state legislatures to overturn the will of the voters would have succeeded.”

Abrams is one of many calling the new Georgia law unconstitutional, and three voting-rights groups have filed a lawsuit. Not to play judge, but bear in mind that the Constitution forbids states from placing undue burdens on citizens’ right to vote. It stands to reason that includes the burden imposed by politicians’ power-grabbing authority over election administration.

Stacey Abrams: Don't boycott corporations over voting rights yet. First press them to speak up.

Arizona — which like Georgia dealt Trump a narrow defeat — is also weighing legislation that would make election oversight more prone to partisan manipulation; one measure introduced there would give the GOP-led legislature authority over the state elections manual, which now rests in the hands of the governor, attorney general and secretary of state.

Overall, as the New York Times reports, GOP legislators in at least eight states are pushing bills that would take election oversight power away from secretaries of state, governors and nonpartisan election boards, and turn it over to legislatures.

Restoring confidence in elections?

Republican lawmakers must be savoring the prospect, as foxes generally do when they’re about to take over guard duty at the henhouse.

Party leaders will tell you that moves like these are necessary to restore public confidence in elections. Quite a trick, that. The only reason confidence needs restoring is that Trump and his party destroyed it by pushing the big lie that that November’s election was rigged and stolen. As attested by judge after judge and election official after election official, Republican appointees as well as Democrat, there is no evidence of cheating or fraud at anything approaching the scale that would change the outcome of the Nov. 6 vote.

Use every tool to protect voting: The Georgia Republican Party wants to set voting rights back decades. Is your state next?

I don’t doubt that some everyday Republicans sincerely believe the lie that’s been fed to them by right-wing media and the ex-president. But it’s increasingly obvious that the most aggressive and high-profile propagators of the lie — hello, Sidney Powell — don’t mean it literally when they tell it.

Trumpian words like “rigged,” “fraud,” and “steal” should be taken as code words. Their real meaning? The election was decisively influenced by people who should not be allowed so much say in electing the president and determining the direction of the country.

The only thing “wrong” with the 2020 presidential election is that a lot of liberals and people of color voted, and the “wrong” person won.

What’s truly wrong is changing election laws to make sure those people can’t do it again.

"Handler, retired service dog reunited by K9 Hero Haven","The Conversation

Holocaust survivor Shalom Stamberg holds a book with a photo of himself in Auschwitz, alongside a copy of his concentration camp record. AP Photo/Ariel SchalitOne in four American millennials believe the Holocaust was exaggerated or entirely made up, according to a recent national survey that sought to find out what young adults know about the genocide of nearly 6 million Jews at the hands of Nazis some 80 years ago. That startling statistic was cited as one of the main reasons that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided in October to finally ban Holocaust denial across the social network. Denying the Holocaust ever happened is an enduring form of anti-Semitic propaganda that attempts to deny or minimize the atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jews during World War II. Following Facebook’s lead, Twitter announced it, too, would remove any posts that denied the history of the Holocaust, though CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to contradict that policy at a Senate hearing weeks later. Holocaust deniers have continued to emerge in social media, and perhaps predictably, many have migrated to less restrictive sites like Parler, where hashtags like #HolocaustNeverHappened and #HolocaustIsALie are widespread. “If you want Holocaust denial, hey, Parler is going to be great for you,” Bill Gates recently said of the social network. While some tech companies address the rise in Holocaust revisionism, and others leave the door open, social networks have played an unwitting role in helping to distort the memory of these horrific events. But as a scholar who studies online extremism, I believe that same community could do more to protect Holocaust remembrance by highlighting the digitized accounts of those who lived through it. French Holocaust survivor Victor Perahia, interned as a child in the Drancy camp outside Paris and then deported to Bergen-Belsen, speaks to students during a January 2020 workshop dedicated to Holocaust remembrance at Drancy. AP Photo/Christophe Ena A decadeslong campaign Holocaust denial has been a tool of anti-Semitic movements since the 1960s. Pseudo-academic groups like the Institute for Historical Review, for example, spent years working to distort the public’s aging memory of the Holocaust, which took place between 1933 and 1945. They tried to cast doubt on the feasibility of the mass executions, and even the existence of the gas chambers. They held annual conferences and gathered fellow deniers to share their beliefs that these events were conjured up by the Jewish people mostly as a means to justify the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. A photo taken April 12, 1945, shows just some of the bodies found by U.S. troops when they arrived at Nordhausen concentration camp in Germany. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library For decades, most people quickly discarded those claims, because they had heard the firsthand accounts of the survivors who were sent to the camps and witnessed the daily operation of genocide and murder of family members. The allegations of the deniers could also not withstand the accounts of soldiers who liberated the camps and made the terrible discoveries of body-filled crematoriums and mass graves. But for deniers, Holocaust revision has little to do with history. Denialism is really a pretext for delivering anti-Semitism in the form of “scholarship,” although few academics ever gave it such attention. So hate groups had to find other means of circulation. They found it online. An image from a film taken during the Soviet liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in early 1945 shows children who had survived the Holocaust. Belarusian State Archive of Documentary Film and Photography/United States Holocaust Memorial Museum via Wikimedia Commons A conspiracy resurrected When the internet took off in the late 1990s, Holocaust deniers and countless other conspiracy theorists saw an opportunity to spread their ideas to new audiences. Anti-Semitic groups could now publish their distortions in well-visited forums, and later in faux-informational websites like Metapedia and The Occidental Observer – extremist communities, in fact, that collectively receive some 350,000 visitors each month. The internet also gave Holocaust deniers an opportunity to reach a much wider public through social media. As early as 2009, Facebook groups emerged that were dedicated to “debunking” the Holocaust, as #Holohoax became a popular hashtag on Twitter, which it continues to be today. Reddit also became a far-right haven for Holocaust deniers, one of whom gained national attention when he was the invited guest of a Florida congressman to the 2018 State of the Union address. For deniers, the internet helped repackage their conspiracy into something less recognizable than hate. I’ve long studied this process, which I call information laundering, tracking illegitimate forms of information, like Holocaust denial, that flow through social networks, blogs and search engines. There they intermix with mainstream ideas and slowly become washed of their radical origins. This decadeslong campaign has resulted in the current surveys that show nearly a quarter of young adults are misinformed or skeptical about the Holocaust. Only now, few survivors are left to correct the record. That makes it even more important to spread the truth. Perhaps the internet can help. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower views the charred bodies of prisoners after the 1945 liberation of the Nazis’ Ohrdruf concentration camp. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library Eisenhower’s intuition When Gen. Dwight Eisenhower visited the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945, after its liberation by U.S. forces, he realized how impossible it might be for people to believe the scale of Nazi atrocities. He wrote powerfully of the experience, and of his reasons for going to see it in person: “The things I saw beggar description. … In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. … I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the near future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to ‘propaganda.’” Eisenhower’s words are instructions for future generations. They underscore the need to be a witness to human cruelty in order to protect the memory of, and lessons learned from, these events from those who would try to distort them. Back online, it may not be enough for social networks to ban Holocaust denial. Similar bans in Europe haven’t limited the rise of anti-Semitism there. Instead, social networks could follow Eisenhower’s example by answering the falsehoods of Holocaust deniers with the true stories of survivors. The internet is already home to thousands of digitized survivor testimonies. They include oral histories that could be readily activated by social networks to refute those who deny the existence of the gas chambers with the accounts of those who stood inside them or witnessed them at work. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit might share the firsthand stories of the Nazi persecutions, separations at the camps or rare reunions, wherever false claims arise, to counter denials with facts. Holocaust survivor Cecilie Klein-Pollack, the author’s grandmother. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum In the spirit of that counternarrative, I will place my grandmother’s story here. She was a Holocaust survivor.

"Should Washington, D.C., become a state?","“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

A proposal to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state was debated during a hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week. Democrats’ impassioned case for granting the district statehood was matched by fervent opposition from Republicans.

Fights over what to do with the nation’s capital has been one of the defining arguments since the early years of American democracy. The first debate was over its location, with Southern states refusing to accept any plan for it to be in the North and vice versa. In 1790, Congress reached a compromise that established a capital district separate from the states along the Potomac River that would be entirely run by the federal government.

Washington, D.C., residents have been fighting for more power to govern themselves ever since. It wasn’t until 1973 that they earned the right to elect their own mayor and city council. Congress still maintains the ability to override local decisions, especially on budgetary matters. The city’s 700,000 residents do not elect senators and are represented by a single delegate in the House of Representatives who is barred from voting on bills.

Historically, most plans to grant D.C. statehood have focused on amending the Constitution — an effort that came close to success in 1978. The current proposal, however, would allow the capital district to remain, but would shrink it so it only encompassed the immediate area where the seats of government are located. The remaining land within the district, where nearly all D.C. residents live, would then become its own state. The major benefit of this new plan is it could pass by a simple majority vote in Congress, rather than the two-thirds majority and state ratifications that are needed to amend the Constitution.

Why there’s debate

Advocates for statehood say the current system disenfranchises D.C.’s citizens, since they have no power to influence federal decision making that directly affects them. They also argue that lawmakers from far-flung parts of the country are given the ability to override the will of local residents, as they’ve done recently on issues like gun control and abortion. Some historians have argued that opposition to D.C. statehood has deeply racist roots informed by a desire to deny power to the city’s predominantly minority population. Others say granting Washington, D.C., two senators — who would almost certainly be Democrat — would help correct an imbalance in the Senate that gives outsized influence to voters from rural states that lean Republican.

Story continues

Opponents say D.C. statehood would violate the intentions of the Founders, who wanted the nation’s capital to be independent from a single state’s political influence. A tiny capital district that was entirely surrounded by a single state would be vulnerable to manipulation by that state’s leaders, they argue. Many on the right say the statehood movement is nothing more than a political power grab by Democrats.

Another group makes the case that rather than becoming its own state, Washington, D.C., should become part of Maryland — the state that controlled the land the city now stands on before the capital was established. This solution, supporters argue, would provide residents with the representation they deserve without upsetting the balance of power in Washington.

What’s next

The bill to grant Washington, D.C., statehood is likely to pass through the House, but its prospects of advancing through the Senate appear slim as long as the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold for legislation remains in place.

A similar debate to determine whether Puerto Rico should become a state, or should be given the chance to become an independent country, has been brewing in Congress as well.

Perspectives

Supporters

D.C.’s residents deserve equal representation in Congress

“D.C. residents pay as much or more in taxes as everyone else in the country. They do jury duty. They fight in wars. They vote for president. They do all the other things that all U.S. citizens do, but they don’t have anyone who votes in Congress who represents them, which is the very definition of taxation without representation.” — Rachel Maddow, MSNBC

Congress shouldn’t be able to override the will of D.C. voters

“More than any actual state in the union, Washington has been at the mercy of the de facto minority party of the GOP. Conservatives have inflicted their ideological checklist on the city government for years, preventing it from enacting strong gun control and recreational cannabis laws and limiting access to abortion within the district.” — Nina Burleigh, NBC News

D.C. senators would help fix the partisan imbalance in the Senate

“The Senate as a whole massively overrepresents white and rural areas, an imbalance that would be reduced slightly, though not eliminated, by adding a majority-minority state.” — Jonathan Chait, New York

GOP opposition is entirely about maintaining political power

“It is not the Constitution that stands in the way of D.C. statehood. It is a political party that would rather deny equal suffrage to 700,000 Americans than cede any modicum of power.” — Mark Joseph Stern, Slate

D.C. statehood would advance racial justice

“D.C. statehood affects everyone. If you are an American who strives to see a more representative Senate — a body that in its 232 years has only had 11 Black senators — then you care about forming the only state that would have a plurality of Black residents. If you care about racial justice, then you care about granting full voting rights to Black Americans.” — Jamal Holtz, Arizona Republic

Opponents

The D.C. statehood push is a partisan ploy by Democrats

“The agitation for D.C. statehood is little more than a cynical play for partisan advantage.” — Editorial, National Review

D.C. should be reabsorbed back into Maryland

“Once residential Washington is no longer the nation's capital, there is no good reason it should be a separate state and not just part of the state that donated the land, Maryland.” — Editorial, Washington Examiner

A potential state of D.C. would have far too much power over the federal government

“This was the exact danger the framers foresaw; when the national government is — in a very practical way — subject to the jurisdiction of a single state, that state gains a heightened ability to muck around in national affairs.” — Michael Cianchette, Bangor Daily News

The Senate was never intended to represent rural and urban voters equally

“The median state is, for now, several points more Republican than the median U.S. voter. Yet the Senate has never aligned perfectly with popular opinion, nor was it designed to. Senate-packing is the left’s remedy.” — Editorial, Wall Street Journal

Fake COVID vaccine cards are a growing — and illegal — trend. Here’s what’s being done,"The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A US-based cruise line just announced a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for its guests and crew,"Windstar Cruises' Wind Spirit. Windstar Cruises

Windstar Cruises has announced a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for its guests and crew.

Guests must be vaccinated at least 14 days before a sailing, and will be required to show proof.

The cruise line is just one of many that have already announced similar requirements.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Several cruise lines around the world have already announced COVID-19 vaccine requirements ahead of the return of cruising. Now, US-based Windstar Cruises will be joining this list with its recent decision to require both guests and crew to be vaccinated.

Like several other cruise lines, Windstar - which currently operates six ships that each carry less than 350 guests - is currently set to resume sailing in June. But if you're an eager Windstar cruiser anticipating this big return, you better be vaccinated.

The small cruise line will require its guests to both test negative for the virus and show proof of the vaccination, which must be received at least 14 days before sailing. Crew members will also have to be vaccinated ""as soon as the vaccine is available to them,"" according to Windstar.

This decision to implement a sweeping COVID-19 vaccine mandate was made in response to increased vaccine access in the US, and ""in the best health and wellness interests of its guests, crew, and the places the yachts visit,"" according to Windstar.

""Vaccination is another layer of safety for all of us, and it's the responsible course of action as our yachts resume cruising and our guests travel the world,"" Christopher Prelog, Windstar Cruises' president, said in a statement.

Windstar Cruises is just one of several cruising companies that have recently made announcements regarding vaccine requirements. Cruise lines like Saga, Crystal, and Hornblower Group's ""overnight"" cruise lines have all announced vaccine requirements for guests. Meanwhile, other companies - like P&O Cruises and Royal Caribbean - have instead decided to unveil specific ""fully vaccinated"" cruises instead of a sweeping company-wide protocol.

Week 1 of Chauvin murder trial concludes with officer testifying use of force used against Floyd was 'unnecessary',"The first week of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin’s trial concluded Friday with testimony from a veteran member of the force who described the force used to subdue George Floyd as “totally unnecessary.”

“Pulling him down to the ground face down and putting your knee on a neck for that amount of time is just uncalled for,” Richard Zimmerman, a lieutenant in the homicide division of the Minneapolis Police Department, told the prosecution. “I saw no reason why the officers felt they were in danger, if that’s what they felt. And that’s what they would have to feel to be able to use that kind of force.”

Zimmerman’s testimony came after four days of emotional testimony from bystanders who witnessed the May 25, 2020, encounter and from other law enforcement officers who were called to the scene where Chauvin pinned Floyd against the pavement by placing a knee on his neck. A total of 19 witnesses have testified during the first week of Chauvin’s murder trial. Hundreds of witnesses could potentially be called before the case is sent to the jury to decide.

Floyd’s death was declared a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office, which concluded that the 46-year-old died from “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” The report also listed “other significant conditions,” including heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and “recent methamphetamine use.”

Chauvin, 45, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. His murder trial is expected to take several weeks.

Here are the key takeaways from week one.

Trial opens with nine-minute video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck

The trial opened Monday with prosecutors showing in court the nine-minute, 29-second video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck.

“Nine-two-nine,” prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told jurors during his opening statement. “The three most important numbers in the case.”

Story continues

The video, taken by a bystander, shows Chauvin restraining Floyd, facedown, with his knees on his neck and back. Floyd can be heard saying “I can’t breathe” 27 times as onlookers plead with Chauvin to stop.

The footage touched off protests across the U.S. last summer. But jurors seated for the trial said during jury selection that they had not seen the video of Floyd in its entirety.

Jena Scurry, a 911 dispatcher who watched live security camera footage of the scene, was the first witness called by prosecutors. Scurry testified that as she watched Floyd lie motionless on the ground, she thought the video footage had frozen.

“My instincts were telling me that something’s wrong,” Scurry said.

She became so concerned that she placed a call to a police sergeant to report a possible misuse-of-force incident.

Witnesses recount anguish watching Floyd's death

On Tuesday, some of the bystanders who watched Floyd die recalled that they felt helpless as the fateful incident unfolded.

Donald Williams, a student of mixed martial arts, testified that he was scared for his own safety as he pleaded with Chauvin to take his knee off of Floyd’s neck — and that he called 911 after Chauvin did not respond to him.

“I did call the police on the police,” Williams said. “Because I believe I witnessed a murder.”

Williams teared up as an audiotape of his 911 call was played in court. He can be heard on the call telling a dispatcher that an officer “pretty much just killed this guy that wasn’t resisting arrest. He had his knee on the dude’s neck this whole time.”

Genevieve Hansen, a Minneapolis firefighter who filmed the incident while off-duty, broke down in tears as she described not being able to render aid to Floyd.

“There was a man being killed,” Hansen said, under questioning from the prosecution. “Had I had access to a call similar to that, I would have been able to provide medical attention to the best of my abilities, and this human was denied that right.”

Genevieve Hansen. (Court TV via Reuters Video)

David Schultz, a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., told Yahoo News that the prosecution was using the testimony from the bystanders to try to “cast a picture” that Chauvin was either “indifferent” or “grossly negligent about George Floyd’s plight.”

“What was particularly interesting is how [the bystanders] described their impressions of Derek Chauvin,” Schultz said, “where they said repeatedly that he didn't seem to be phased. He was ignoring the pleas from George Floyd.”

Store employee says Floyd appeared to be under the influence

On Wednesday, the jury heard from witnesses who interacted with Floyd before he died, including a cashier at Cup Foods, the convenience store where Floyd purchased cigarettes with a counterfeit bill before his arrest.

Christopher Martin, a 19-year-old former Cup Foods employee, was asked by prosecutors to narrate the events captured on the store’s security camera that showed Floyd interacting with staff and other customers.

Christopher Martin. (Court TV via Reuters Video)

“He seemed very friendly, approachable. He was talkative, just having an average Memorial Day, living his life,” Martin said. “But he did seem high.”

Martin believed that Floyd didn’t know the bill he used to purchase the cigarettes was fake.

Martin testified that the manager at Cup Foods called the police about the counterfeit bill, adding that he had offered to use his own money to cover the debt and felt guilt over the altercation that followed after police arrived.

Prosecutors also showed body camera footage that provided a closer look at the attempts by Chauvin and his fellow officers to restrain Floyd.

Floyd’s girlfriend takes the stand; Floyd family attorney speaks out

On Thursday, Courteney Batya Ross, Floyd’s girlfriend, testified that she and Floyd struggled with an opioid addiction and that Floyd used drugs while grieving the death of his mother.

A prosecution witness, Ross testified under cross-examination that Floyd was hospitalized following an overdose in March 2020, two months before his own death. Ross said she had taken Floyd to the hospital because he complained he wasn’t feeling well and that his stomach hurt. She later learned that Floyd suffered an overdose, but said she never learned what drugs had caused it.

Courteney Batya Ross. (Court TV via Reuters Video)

As Ross delivered her testimony, Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, attorneys for Floyd’s family, issued a statement to reporters that criticized the defense team for attempting to “construct the narrative” that the fentanyl discovered in Floyd’s system was the cause of his death.

“We want to remind the world who witnessed his death on video that George was walking, talking, laughing, and breathing just fine before Derek Chauvin held his knee to George’s neck,” the attorneys said in a statement.

Ross also testified that, at the time of his death, Floyd was still grieving the loss of his mother, who had died two years previously. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors played video filmed by bystanders in which Floyd calls out “Mama!” as Chauvin applies pressure to Floyd’s neck with his knee.

After returning from her funeral in Houston in May 2018, Ross said that Floyd, who she described as a “mama’s boy,” seemed “like a shell of himself.”

""He was broken,” she said.

During cross-examination, Ross said that Floyd also called her “mama,” raising the possibility that Floyd had called out for his girlfriend — rather than his mother — during his final moments alive.

Paramedics say Chauvin stayed on Floyd’s neck after they arrived

Hennepin County paramedics Derek Smith and Seth Zachary Bravinder. (Court TV via Reuters Video)

Seth Zachary Bravinder, a paramedic who treated Floyd, testified that he asked Chauvin to get off Floyd’s neck so they “could move the patient” to begin resuscitation.

When he arrived, Bravinder said he had assumed there was potentially an ongoing struggle because police officers were still on top of Floyd.

But Bravinder and his partner soon discovered that Floyd was “unresponsive,” didn’t have a pulse and appeared to be in cardiac arrest.

According to Bravinder, the paramedics loaded Floyd into the ambulance, in part, to get away from the crowd of bystanders who appeared to be angry.

Bravinder’s partner, Derek Smith, testified that he checked Floyd’s pupils and determined that they were dilated, and that he also did not detect a pulse.

“In lay terms, I thought he was dead,” Smith said.

Minnesota police sergeant believes restraint on Floyd went too far

Minneapolis Police Sgt. David Pleoger. (Court TV via Reuters Video)

Former Minneapolis Police Sgt. David Pleoger, who was a shift supervisor at the time of the incident, told prosecuting attorney Steve Schleicher that he believes the use of restraint on Floyd should have ended when he no longer resisted.

“Based on your review of the body-worn camera footage,” Schleicher asked Pleoger, “do you have an opinion as to when the restraint of Floyd should have ended in this encounter?”

“Yes,” Pleoger said.

“What is it?” Schleicher asked.

“When Floyd was no longer offering up any resistance to the officers,” Pleoger said.

Pleoger also testified that he did not know Floyd had died until he and the other officers who were involved in the incident went to Hennepin County Medical Center. It was there that Chauvin told Pleoger that he had knelt on Floyd’s neck, according to Pleoger’s testimony.

Through the testimony of Pleoger and Zimmerman, and potentially other law enforcement officials, the prosecution is seeking to establish that what Chauvin did was “not acceptable practice” for a police officer, Shultz said.

Prosecutors are trying to show that Chauvin “wasn't following protocol. He wasn't doing what he was supposed to,” Schultz said. “Therefore that takes him out of what a reasonable police officer would have done.

“That’s going to be important, eventually, for establishing that he's beyond the protection of the qualified immunity or statutory immunities,” Shultz said.

Chauvin’s defense seeks to counter video footage of Floyd’s death

While the prosecution is making its case during the first weeks of the trial, Chauvin’s defense team has been building their own narrative throughout the proceedings. Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, attempted to challenge the perception that Floyd was helpless during the incident. He described Floyd as combative and resistant, and said the evidence will show that, when confronted by police, he “put drugs in his mouth in an effort to conceal them” from the officers.

“You will see that three Minneapolis police officers could not overcome the strength of Mr. Floyd,” Nelson said during his opening statement on Monday. “Mr. Chauvin stands 5-foot-9, 140 pounds. Mr. Floyd is 6-foot-3, and weighs 223 pounds.”

Through his questions this week, Nelson seemed to suggest that the group of bystanders, who grew angry as Chauvin and other officers remained on Floyd, affected the officers’ decision making.

“What he’s trying to suggest here is that, given the crowd's reaction, either (a) Derek Chauvin was acting very professionally in not reacting to the crowd, or (b) given the fact that he didn’t know what the crowd was going to do, he had to continue keeping George Floyd under control,” Schultz said. “[Nelson] clearly was giving the jury an alternative context for understanding what was going on.”

"CDC tells vaccinated Americans travel is 'low risk,' as Biden urges caution amid rising infection numbers","WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the most significant loosening of travel guidelines in months on Friday, saying that fully vaccinated people could travel, a development that appeared out of sync with White House messaging.

“CDC recommends that fully vaccinated people can travel at low risk to themselves,” the new guidance said. The agency now says that fully vaccinated people do not have to quarantine or take a diagnostic test when traveling domestically. International travelers should take a coronavirus diagnostic test before boarding their return flights to the United States and then another such test within five days of landing in the U.S.

President Biden at the White House on Friday. (Erin Scott/Reuters)

While appearing to condone travel, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky still urged even vaccinated Americans to remain at home as case numbers continue to rise, a message that could be confusing for people weighing visits to family or vacation spots.

Speaking from the White House earlier on Friday afternoon in celebration of both jobs gained and coronavirus vaccinations administered throughout the course of March, President Biden also offered a cautious message. “The progress we’ve worked so hard to achieve can be reversed,” he said, speaking of both economic and pandemic-related developments.

“Too many Americans are acting as if this fight is over,” Biden warned a few minutes later. “It is not.”

The White House did not respond to a Yahoo News inquiry regarding whether the president agreed with the new CDC guidance. Such seemingly contradictory messages have marked the response to the coronavirus at all levels of government. Much as every elected official has vowed to “listen to the science,” science and politics rarely walk hand in hand.

The new CDC guidance says people should still wear masks and take other precautions, such as washing hands and maintaining 6 feet of distance when possible.

That guidance updates a previous recommendation against all nonessential travel, which many Americans had not been heeding in recent weeks. The Transportation Security Administration recorded 1.56 million people passing through American airports on Thursday, the second-highest such number since last spring’s shutdowns drove millions of Americans indoors (the record, 1.57 million daily travelers, came on March 28).

Story continues

That new guidance comes only days after Walensky said she was regularly stricken by a feeling of “impending doom” over a potential fourth wave of the pandemic.

There were 77,718 new cases of the coronavirus across the United States on April 1, a significant jump from the 56,679 that were added on March 1. That made the timing of the new guidance somewhat inauspicious from a public health perspective, as Walensky herself seemed to say during Friday’s briefing of the White House coronavirus task force. She pointed out that even though vaccinated people could travel, she could not recommend that they actually do so just yet, “due to the rising number of cases.”

“I want to acknowledge today that providing guidance in the midst of a changing pandemic, and its changing science, is complex,” Walensky went on to say. “On the one hand, we are telling you we are worried about rising cases, to wear a mask and to avoid travel.”

At the same time, she pointed out, her agency was giving people the license to travel, in a seeming countermand of her own insistent warnings, which some have criticized as overly dire.

Studies indicate that fully inoculated people are at an extremely low risk of becoming seriously sick with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. They are also highly unlikely to act as passive transmitters of the coronavirus to unvaccinated people. (Earlier this week, Walensky ruled out such transmission altogether, but the CDC later qualified her comments with a measure of uncertainty.)

“We must balance this guidance with the fact that most Americans are not yet fully vaccinated, which is likely contributing to our rising cases,” Walensky explained. “And that means we have to continue to reinforce messages about the critical importance of COVID-19 prevention measures.”

The new guidance could also prove an enticement to people who have been reluctant about coronavirus vaccination.

Only about 20 percent of American adults have been fully vaccinated. The CDC does not recommend travel for people who have received only the first dose of a two-dose vaccine. Only the vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson requires a single dose.

Biden has promised Americans that they can have a nearly normal Independence Day holiday, provided vaccinations proceed apace and people continue to wear masks. But many people do not appear willing to wait until July, as Walensky appears to have recognized.

The CDC’s revision to its travel guidelines comes after a rowdy Florida spring break and a reported rise in hotel bookings. Those developments, and the arrival of warmer weather across the United States, have put both public health officials and elected leaders in a difficult position, forcing them to balance sound science with reality.

Gaetz's communications director resigns as sex scandal grows,"The Guardian

The fact that this guy is a sitting member of Congress shows just how low we set the bar for our (male) politicians Matt Gaetz: a man who has spent his career reveling in scandal rather than actually doing his job. Photograph: Michael Brochstein/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock A guide to navigating ‘Gaetzgate’ The Matt Gaetz story increasingly reads like a script written by a pervert high on a cocktail of ADHD meds and MDMA. Even if you’ve been following the scandal-prone Republican congressman’s latest controversy closely it’s hard to keep track of what on earth is happening. So here’s a guide to navigating the saga far. First and foremost, it has been established that Gaetz is under federal investigation for sexual misconduct. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the justice department (DoJ) is investigating whether Gaetz, 38, “had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her to travel with him”. If these allegations are accurate, then Gaetz could have violated federal sex trafficking laws. According to the Times, the allegations are part of a broader investigation into a political ally of Gaetz’s named Joel Greenberg, a Florida tax collector who was indicted last year on charges including the sex trafficking of a child. Greenberg also reportedly misused public funds to buy servers for a cryptocurrency company as well as weapons, ammunition and a drone. As you do. After the Times broke the story, Gaetz confirmed to Axios that he was under federal investigation for sexual misconduct and is worried about being criminally charged. Rather predictably, however, he insists that he’s actually the victim in all of this and has said “no part of the allegations” against him are true. Gaetz, who is currently engaged to a woman 12 years younger than him, claimed that he used to be a “generous” partner in his single days and paid for flights and hotel rooms. “I think someone is trying to make that look criminal when it is not,” he said. Why would someone want to do that? Well, in a statement released on Tuesday Gaetz said he and his family have “been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DoJ official seeking $25m while threatening to smear my name”. He claims the investigation is a cover for extortion and suggested that it was linked to the “Biden White House”. Which is a weird claim considering the New York Times reports that the investigation into Gaetz, a Donald Trump loyalist, was opened in the final months of the Trump administration under then attorney general William Barr. Here’s where things get really weird. According to the Washington Post, a couple of grifters who learned of the investigation against Gaetz decided to use the opportunity to extort the congressman’s father. They reportedly wrote to Don Gaetz and said that there were pictures of his son with “child prostitutes”; they would help Gaetz, however, if he gave them a large sum of money. The idea, dubbed “Project Homecoming”, was that they’d use that money to locate and rescue Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who was kidnapped in Iran back in 2007. Levinson, who is presumed dead, would be heroically rescued by Gaetz; Joe Biden would be so thrilled with the rescue that he’d pardon Gaetz. The bottom line? It seems plausible that Gaetz really is caught up in a bizarre extortion plot. However, there are two possible scenarios here. Scenario one: Gaetz did nothing wrong and is telling the truth about being the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy orchestrated by his political rivals that kicked off when Gaetz’s buddy Trump was in power. Scenario two: there is no big conspiracy against the congressman; a couple of opportunists simply pounced on the investigation against him as a way to make money. I don’t know about you but the second scenario seems rather more plausible to me. Ultimately, it’s important not to let all the drama distract from the real issue here, which is that a sitting congressman seems to be under investigation for sex trafficking and has links to a guy who has already been indicted for sex trafficking. It doesn’t really look good for Gaetz. It looks so bad, in fact, that Gaetz’s communications officer abruptly left his job on Friday. While the allegations against Gaetz are still being investigated, it’s worth noting that Gaetz has faced accusations of disturbing sexual conduct before. In January 2020 Chris Latvala, a Republican congressman, tweeted that Gaetz “created a game where members of the FL House got ‘points’ for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists, and married legislators”. Gaetz also reportedly bragged of his sexual exploits and showed other lawmakers nude photos of women he’d slept with. According to CNN, he showed his colleagues these photos while he was at work. Gaetz, by the way, was also the only lawmaker to vote against a bipartisan anti human-trafficking bill. A number of his colleagues have also spoken out about “love of alcohol and illegal drugs, as well as his proclivity for younger women”. I don’t know exactly what Gaetz has or hasn’t done, but I do know he’s spent his career reveling in scandal rather than actually doing his job. He even joked with Elon Musk last week about how a scandal involving him would be called GaetzGate. The fact that this guy is a sitting member of Congress boggles the mind. It shows just how low we set the bar for our (male) politicians. Boy, do I ever regret giving Gaetz the benefit of the doubt I should state for the record that I wrote an article last year saying I thought it was unfair that people were insinuating Gaetz had an inappropriate relationship with his t “son”, Nestor. And there is no evidence, to be clear, that the relationship is inappropriate. However I have certainly learned my lesson: never ever even vaguely defend Matt Gaetz.

Ivanka’s women’s empowerment scheme not very empowering after all The Government Accountability Office has issued a very unflattering report about Ivanka Trump’s women’s empowerment initiative. I am you are just as shocked about this as I am. How Lady Mary Wortley Montagu’s bold experiment led to smallpox vaccine Edward Jennner gets the credit for inventing the smallpox vaccine in 1796. Turns out he was building on a woman’s work: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had successfully inculcated her three-year-old daughter several decades before Jenner’s experiments. Of course, she got zero credit for her ideas at the time and was denounced as an “ignorant woman”. Andrew Cuomo is fighting to erect a skyscraper called Penn15 in Manhattan I wish this was a joke but it’s not. The New York governor is facing a number of scandals but refuses to resign and is reportedly obsessed with this real estate project. Perhaps because the people behind it have given a lot of money to his campaigns. The week in pawtriarchy The only person who might be worse at their job than Cuomo is the genius who reportedly tried to pass off a golden retriever as a lion at a Chinese zoo. The zookeeper may have been inspired by an incident a few weeks earlier at another zoo in China where a supposed wolf’s cage housed a rottweiler. Which might be funny were it not for the fact that many Chinese zoos are notoriously cruel.",
Chauvin trial: Minneapolis police lieutenant calls restraint on Floyd 'totally unnecessary',"The Guardian

Vote in Bessemer, Alabama, is chance to inform younger generations about the role unions play, labor leaders say Union organizers outside the Amazon facility in Bessemer. Photograph: Nathan Posner/REX/Shutterstock Counting is currently under way for the historic union election at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, and union organizers and leaders throughout the labor movement are hoping the effort will help galvanize support for workers and unions in the south and across the US. Tevita Uhatafe, 35, a member of Transport Workers Union of America Local 513 in the Dallas area, was one of several union members and leaders who visited Bessemer to lend their support for the union organizing drive. “I just wanted to hear workers’ stories, see what was going on there and learn a little bit about what was going on with their lives, as well as what can we do to help these people and support this union effort,” said Uhatafe. The enthusiasm comes as a pivotal moment for US unions. Joe Biden was elected on a pro-union platform and only this week told a crowd in Pittsburgh: “I’m a union guy. I support unions. Unions built the middle class, and it’s about time they start to get a piece of the action.” The huge publicity the Amazon vote is attracting is a chance to inform a younger generations that have not received a lot of education on the history of the US labor movement about the role unions have played in Alabama, said Uhatafe. “I really wanted to show them that there’s a new generation that’s coming up that wants to bring this movement into this generation, and show people that we really do fight for their jobs and for their livelihoods,” he added. “There’s going to be a whole lot of organizing going on if this is successful – even if it isn’t, the fuse has been lit.” Other labor leaders and workers echoed his sentiments. “The union drive in Bessemer, Alabama, is going to have a ripple effect,” said Liz Shuler, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US. “It’s about so much more than Amazon. It’s about fundamental power and inequality. About a labor movement that’s innovating and organizing on a new frontier to take on issues like data collection, and making progress in the long march for civil rights. And Bessemer is inspiring people all over the country to take collective action with their co-workers. This isn’t the end, it’s a powerful beginning.” The coronavirus pandemic exposed poor working conditions in industries and jobs where workers are deemed “essential” and praised as “heroes” but often receive wages and benefits that make it difficult for them to make ends meet. The risks posed by Covid-19 often worsened working conditions and heightened concerns about safety protections in places like Amazon warehouses that not only continued operating, but saw surges in demand and profits. Chris Smalls, who was fired from Amazon’s Staten Island, New York warehouse after organizing a protest at the beginning of the pandemic over Covid-19 safety concerns, has spent the past year participating in actions and speaking out in favor of organizing efforts at Amazon around the US, including in Alabama. “This is the most important union drive since probably the Great Depression,” said Smalls. “The whole nation is watching this vote. Our hopes no matter which way it goes is that Alabama lights a spark for all of us to start organizing in a city near you. That’s exactly what we intend to do and I support any and all efforts to do so.” The union drive has drawn support from community leaders, organizers and elected officials around the US, and in the Birmingham, Alabama area. Labor unions, including the Major League Baseball Players Association, NFL Players Association, several members of Congress, celebrities and organizations have publicly endorsed the effort, participated in solidarity rallies in cities around the US, or visited Bessemer. Workers around the world have also posted video messages to publicly announce their support for the unionization effort. Bernie Sanders speaks at a rally in support of unionization at an Alabama Amazon facility on 26 March. Photograph: Nathan Posner/REX/Shutterstock “Without unions we would not have the 40-hour work week, vacation days, sick leave, or employee benefits that millions rely on. Unions built the middle class of this country, and have played a historic role in shaping Birmingham and Jefferson county as a whole, granting opportunities to thousands of working families,” said Randall Woodfin, mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, in a statement in support of the union. “Birmingham has a long history of workers of all races banding together to demand better working conditions, and the unionization effort in Bessemer is a critical chapter in the history of organized labor in our community.” The Rev Tonny H Algood with the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign explained that history in the south, as industrialization in the southern US grew after the second world war as corporations sought cheap, non-union workforces, and state governments have since characterized themselves as pro-industry. “The state has sided with corporations every time,” Algood said. As an example, he cited Jefferson county changing the traffic light patterns outside the Amazon warehouse at the request of the company as union organizers utilized the stop to speak with workers, and the use of local police providing security for the Amazon warehouse. From Martin Luther King’s launching of the Poor People’s Campaign in 1967, Alabama, especially in the Birmingham area, has a vast history of labor union organizing connected to the civil rights movement. During the 1960s, civil rights activists in Birmingham relied on their labor union relationships to bolster the civil rights movement, such as Col Stone Johnson, who recruited other union members to serve as bodyguards for the homes and churches of local civil rights movement leaders, or Henry Jenkins, a Retail Wholesale Department Store union member and shop steward in Birmingham, Alabama, who faced racist threats and attacks while organizing workers in the area in the 1960s. An estimated 85% of the workers at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer are Black, and organizations like Black Lives Matter-Birmingham and union organizers have emphasized these connections through the union effort. “This type of organizing and collaboration is not new to Alabama. It seems as though Amazon thought that they can come to Alabama and extend this slave labor-like working environment and that would be okay here,” said Celida Soto Garcia, the president of Sweet (Sustainable Water, Energy and Economic Transition) Alabama. “I guess they didn’t read up on history, because that’s never permissible here in our state. Historically it never has been and never will be.” She expressed disappointment with Amazon’s adversarial response to the union organizing drive, especially given the immense wealth founder Jeff Bezos has accumulated from the company. Throughout the union election process, Amazon has hired expensive anti-union consultants, attempted to delay the election and force an in-person vote, and pushed anti-union messages to workers through texts, posters, ads, emails, a website, captive audience meetings and mailings. Amazon’s union opposition has extended to social media, as executives and its public relations team have repeatedly asserted the company’s union opposition. “I really expected more from Amazon. We celebrated their arrival here because we expected more from this multibillion-dollar corporation but it seems that they want to move forward with treating our invaluable people here in Alabama like cogs in the machine,” added Soto Garcia. “We’re going to win this for them and we’re not going to stop fighting until we win this for them.”",

In a chaotic situation at the southern border, agents are escorting migrants and expelling them from the US before they know what’s happening Joel Duarte Mendez, 25, and his son, Hector, traveled from Honduras to the US over 12 days to city of Reynosa, Texas. They were flown from the Rio Grande Valley to El Paso and later bussed and deported into Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Photograph: Jorge Salgado/The Guardian They couldn’t work out quite where they were or where they were headed when the guards told them: “Keep going”. They walked forward, as instructed, across an unfamiliar bridge and then suddenly they were in Mexico. Or, more accurately, back in Mexico. But 800 miles from where they had arrived in America. In a chaotic situation at the southern border, US Customs and Border Protection agents are escorting migrants across the bridge that links downtown El Paso, Texas, with the adjacent city in Mexico, Ciudad Juárez, and expelling them from the US before they even know what’s happening. One young mother just sat directly down on the sidewalk on the Mexican side of the international bridge linking the two cities and clutched her breastfeeding child to her as they huddled in cold, late March weather. The child, no more than 18 months old, wearing a pink sweater and wrapped in a blanket first fed, then slept in her arms, unaware of the moments her bewildered mother would let a tear roll down her face. At one point the woman covered the little girl’s hands with socks to stop her from crying due to the cold wind, despite the fact that the mother didn’t have a jacket of her own. A group of migrants rapidly deported from the US under Trump’s Title 42 wait on the Mexican side of the Paso del Norte international bridge, between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico on 10 March 2021. Photograph: Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images The sight is all too familiar in Juárez where dozens of migrants are being unceremoniously ejected from the US daily via a health protocol put in place by the Trump administration, known as Title 42, where migrants can be expelled to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the US. Some undocumented people who cross the US-Mexico border are being admitted to the US to begin the asylum process, mainly unaccompanied minors and – theoretically – parents with very young children. But most adult migrants and families currently being apprehended in the US are being expelled, though often not before being taken on a confusing and winding journey by the authorities on the American side. “I came through Reynosa, I went to the wall and immigration picked us up,” 25-year-old Joel Duarte Mendez, who had originally traveled from Honduras, explained. Reynosa is at the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border, 754 miles from the cities of Juárez and El Paso at the extreme western end. After crossing from Reynosa into Texas, Mendez and his two-year-old son, Hector, were briefly detained. “Then they had us on a plane, then from there they put us on a bus and they just threw us here,” he said, pointing at the international bridge linking El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. I said, ‘this is my opportunity to go’ and, well, that just simply wasn’t the case American border agents had lined up the group of people after they got off the bus, took them part way across the bridge and then “they told us to ‘keep going’,” Mendez said. He clung to Hector, the boy wrapped in a jacket obviously fit for his father, who was braving the cold weather in a T-shirt. “I came with my son to give him a better life,” Mendez said. Their trip from Honduras to the border took 12 days, he said. He owned a coffee farm and a home in Honduras, but both had been destroyed when massive hurricanes hit the country last November. With the climate crisis believed to be causing stronger hurricanes, Mendez and Hector have effectively become climate refugees. He used what was left of his money to pay for the trip, he said. “We thought they were letting people with children five years and younger enter [the US], so I said, ‘this is my opportunity to go’ and, well, that just simply wasn’t the case,” he told the Guardian, dejectedly. Families wait inside a processing center in Ciudad Juárez as they are interviewed near the Paso del Norte international bridge. Photograph: Jorge Salgado/The Guardian Title 42 was the last big piece of Donald Trump’s anti-immigration agenda that all but closed the US-Mexico border to the undocumented in the pandemic. Joe Biden’s administration has rescinded Trump’s so-called Remain in Mexico policy, where migrants were forced to wait in often-dangerous border towns in Mexico while their claims for asylum from violent countries were processed in the US, sometimes taking years. But for those without legal cases already underway in the US, Biden is continuing to use Title 42 while the pandemic lingers. Many crossing the border now are not even being officially processed into a border patrol or a Department of Health and Human Services facility, nor being turned over to family in the states to await a date with immigration court. They are just expelled into Mexico. Mendez and the breastfeeding mother were among a group of approximately three-dozen migrants, almost all of them parents with young children, whom the Guardian saw being ousted from the US in recent days. In Juárez, they were escorted into a gated area right off the bridge by the Mexican authorities, where journalists were not allowed to interview them. But tears were visible, and many looked confused. The last mother in line had a young boy in her arms and another small child walking in front of her, both children were crying, while tears began streaming down the woman’s face when she realized she was in Mexico. The group spent more than an hour in the gated area, before it was opened and several families spilled onto the streets of Juárez, left to fend for themselves. Those who had contacts in the area asked for directions to taxis or called someone to pick them up, but others just sat on the street, unsure of their next move. One father, who was not prepared to share his name, explained that since crossing briefly into the US they had never been told where they were or where they were going. “We were there in the detention center waiting supposedly for them to contact a family member of ours [in the US] so they could come get us or send for us, but no, they lied to us,” he said. The other father said: “It’s completely false that they would let us enter with small children.” Four children sit on the streets of Ciudad Juárez after being deported from the US. Photograph: Jorge Salgado/The Guardian There are conflicting reports about why migrants are being transported from one end of the Texas border to the other, ranging from accounts about emergency shelters being full on either side of the border, especially because of Covid-19 restrictions that have closed many or shrunk capacity, to cruel tactics simply to deter migrants with an extra dose of desperation. Nearby, another family: three children huddled around their mother, the father pacing back and forth. He confirmed that they had received no information from the agents who expelled them. “Imagine what we go through from Honduras to get here: walking, hitchhiking, feeling hungry, suffering with our children,” he said. “They took our photos, our fingerprints, kept us for three days, and then sent us here without signing anything.” Mendez said he thought things would be different under the Biden administration. He has a brother in Charlotte, North Carolina, who had been expecting to pick him and Hector up, when Mendez called him with the bad news. “He reprimanded me for making the journey,” Mendez said. “I told him I had no other choice, I didn’t want us to starve.” Now, he was stranded in Juárez, thousands of miles from home, with no money to return.

We're about to get the 1st GOP election test in the post-Trump era,"Amanda Chase’s candidacy for governor in Virginia this year has confronted the state’s GOP with a dilemma that mirrors the challenge facing the national party: How does it reap the benefits of Trumpism but also reduce the costs?

Can it retain voters drawn to the party because of former President Donald Trump and his style of politics, but at the same time push, nudge or maneuver Trump-like candidates like Chase — who are likely to lose winnable elections — out of the way?

Virginia Republicans may have found a way to do just that by using a method of voting that reformers are promoting nationally as a tool to reduce extremism and polarization.

State Sen. Amanda Chase is a far-right Republican who promoted the lies about cheating in the 2020 election and has affiliated herself with supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory and attracted support from militia members. Two close supporters of hers, who appeared next to her when she announced her candidacy, were arrested outside a Philadelphia vote-counting location after the fall election, carrying concealed weapons on them and possessing 160 rounds of ammunition in their vehicle. They have been charged with an attempt to interfere with elections and with conspiracy.

Chase called on Trump to declare martial law so he could overturn his defeat at the hands of Joe Biden.

Chase has been considered a legitimate threat to win the Republican nomination, although in Virginia — where a Republican has not won a statewide race since 2009 — she was widely considered to have no shot at winning the general election and becoming governor.

But the Virginia GOP’s decision to use ranked-choice voting in choosing a nominee on May 8 has cut down her chances significantly. The party used ranked-choice voting to choose its chairman last summer.

In a regular primary, which Chase pushed for, a candidate can win the nomination with less than 50 percent of the vote. All they need is a plurality. So Chase could have won 30 or 40 percent of the vote and gained the nomination as three more mainstream candidates split the other 60 to 70 percent. That is similar to how Trump himself won the GOP nomination for president in 2016 despite winning less than half the votes cast in the Republican primary.

Story continues

But with ranked-choice voting, a candidate must get a majority to win the nomination.

Here’s how it works: Voters don’t select just one candidate. They list their preferences in order, and if none of the candidates gets 50.1 percent, then, in essence, the candidate who gets the most first-place and second-place votes will win.

Ranked-choice voting works a little differently among various jurisdictions that have implemented it, and the Virginia GOP has not clarified how it will distribute second-place votes yet. Normally, the last-place candidate is eliminated and the second-place votes cast by their voters are distributed, and so on until someone has a majority.

“Amanda may have a plurality, but she is everyone else’s last choice, which dooms her from the start,” said Shaun Kenney, a former executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia.

Virginia is a state where the GOP cannot afford to indulge the hard-core right wing if it wants to win statewide. The last Republican to win a statewide election was Bob McDonnell when he won the governorship in 2009. Republican Bill Bolling won the lieutenant governor seat that year, and Republican Ken Cuccinelli won the attorney general’s race.

But a few years later, in 2013, Cuccinelli defeated the more moderate Bolling in the Republican primary for governor, and then lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a close election. The next summer, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican, lost his primary to college economics professor Dave Brat, who criticized him as weak on immigration and received help from conservative talk radio personalities. Brat went on to win the general election.

Since those two elections, the Virginia GOP has moved further right as the state has grown more diverse and voted in higher numbers for Democrats. Democratic turnout in governor’s races went from 1.1 million in 2013 to 1.4 million in 2017; in presidential contests, from 2 million in 2016 to 2.4 million in 2020. Republican turnout has increased as well, but not at the same pace.

“Virginia is a bluish state. … Guns, babies and Trump is not going to be a winning election message in the entire state. You have to do more than that,” Daniel Gade, the Virginia GOP’s nominee for U.S. Senate in 2020, said in a recent interview on a local talk radio show.

Gade, who lost his bid to Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, said Republicans need to talk about economic growth and reopening schools. School reopening in particular could be a potent election-year issue in Virginia if any significant number of schools do not return full time in the fall. Virginia, along with New Jersey, is one of only two states that hold elections for governor and other statewide offices in odd years.

The gubernatorial election is a crossroads for the Virginia GOP, said Kenney.

“The best exorcism we could use is a convention floor fight where we finally point at what Chase stands for and pull a Reagan: ‘Those voices don’t speak for the rest of us,’” he told Yahoo News, quoting the 40th president’s famous “Time for Choosing” speech.

“It’s plagued us since Dave Brat beat Eric Cantor in 2014. We either exorcise the demons once and for all as conservatives or succumb to the idea that alt-right nationalism is what Republicans actually believe. Those are the stakes. And we can do it ... provided conservatives don’t split ourselves six ways to Sunday.”

The ranked-choice voting system is a tool that ensures a majority doesn’t split its support in a way that allows someone like Chase to exploit a failure of collective action. And, as a result, Chase isn’t happy about the Virginia GOP’s embrace of the practice.

Chase filed a lawsuit against the state party over its decision to hold a convention instead of a primary, which means voters have to sign up as delegates in advance to cast a ballot. She has also called the party’s delays in finalizing details for how to participate “voter suppression of the almost 2 million voters who voted for President Trump.” Her lawsuit, however, was dismissed in February.

As of now, it appears that the contest will come down to two business leaders — Glenn Youngkin and Pete Snyder — and one veteran lawmaker, Kirk Cox, who was Virginia’s House majority leader from 2010 to 2018.

Chase, meanwhile, has been in a defensive crouch since the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. She’s also threatening to run as an independent should Snyder win the nomination, saying the convention has been “rigged” against her.

“I think that really ended up being the start of the end for her,” Chris Saxman, a former Republican state delegate who now does political consulting, told Yahoo News. The Chase campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Chase had courted controversy plenty of times before Jan. 6, but the day before the insurrection she did a live-stream interview on Facebook with Joshua Macias, one of the two men arrested in Philadelphia with a concealed weapon outside a vote-counting center. Chase introduced Macias as an organizer of the Trump rally that would take place the next day. And she herself attended the rally on the Ellipse, where Trump spoke before his supporters marched to the Capitol and attempted to violently stop the certification of the presidential election results.

Chase said she did not march to the Capitol, but she has drawn attention for being one of three state legislators who attended the rally. And days after the insurrection, she called the rioters who assaulted the Capitol “patriots.”

“She overplayed her hand,” Saxman said. Prior to Jan. 6, “she was up there … doing quite well.”

But since the Capitol riot, her official Facebook page — which had over 125,000 followers — has been suspended permanently. Although she still has a personal page, her ability to speak to supporters through social media gave her a way around the traditional methods for raising money, which typically involve asking the business community for big donations.

Chase led in a poll conducted in early February by Christopher Newport University, with 17 percent support, although the poll showed 55 percent undecided, and it was not a poll that measured support among the small number of people who will take part in a party convention.

And it appears that Chase is not popular even in some of the most conservative pockets of the state. She attended services at a megachurch in Leesburg on Palm Sunday, a congregation that had hosted conservative activists for a “Pray, Vote, Stand” town hall earlier this year.

After the service, Chase complained that she had not been allowed to bring her gun into the service, and that she had not been asked to speak to the congregation in the same way that a candidate for attorney general had been.

“Can I be honest and tell you it was all I could do to choke back the tears? To sacrifice so much only to be treated like a third class citizen hurts,” Chase wrote on her personal Facebook page. “The Bible says to give honor where honor is due and to pray for those in authority.”

Key takeaways from day 4 of the Chauvin trial: Paramedics say Floyd was unresponsive when they arrived,"The fourth day of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin’s trial featured testimony from George Floyd’s longtime girlfriend as well as from first responders who attempted to resuscitate him after his fateful encounter with police.

Jurors heard from five witnesses on Thursday, including paramedics and other emergency workers called to the scene where Chauvin pinned Floyd against the pavement by placing a knee on his neck.

In all, 17 people, most of whom witnessed Floyd’s May 25, 2020, death firsthand, have testified in case so far.

Chauvin, 45, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. His murder trial is expected to take several weeks.

Here are the key takeaways from day four.

Floyd’s girlfriend takes the stand; Floyd family attorney speaks out

Courteney Batya Ross, Floyd’s girlfriend, testified that she and Floyd struggled with an opioid addiction and that Floyd used drugs while grieving the death of his mother.

A prosecution witness, Ross testified under cross-examination that Floyd was hospitalized following an overdose in March 2020, two months before his own death. Ross said she had taken Floyd to the hospital because he complained he wasn’t feeling well and that his stomach hurt.

Floyd’s May 25, 2020, death was declared a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office, which concluded that the 46-year-old died from “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” The report also listed “other significant conditions,” including heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and “recent methamphetamine use.”

As Ross delivered her testimony, Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, attorneys for Floyd’s family, issued a statement to reporters that criticized the defense team for attempting to “construct the narrative” that the fentanyl discovered in Floyd’s system was the cause of his death.

“We want to remind the world who witnessed his death on video that George was walking, talking, laughing and breathing just fine before Derek Chauvin held his knee to George’s neck,” the attorneys said in a statement released to reporters as Ross testified.

Ross also testified that at the time of his death, Floyd was still grieving the loss of his mother, who passed away two years earlier. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors played video filmed by bystanders in which Floyd calls out “Mama!” as Chauvin applies pressure to Floyd’s neck with his knee.

After returning from her funeral in Houston in May 2018, Ross said that Floyd, who she described as a “mama’s boy,” seemed “like a shell of himself.”

""He was broken,” she said.

During cross-examination from defense attorney Eric Nelson, Ross said that Floyd also called her “mama,” raising the possibility that Floyd had called out for his girlfriend — rather than his mother — during his final moments alive.

Paramedics say Chauvin stayed on Floyd’s neck after they arrived

Seth Zachary Bravinder, a paramedic with the local EMS who treated Floyd, testified that he asked Chauvin to get off Floyd’s neck so they “could move the patient” to begin resuscitation.

When he arrived, Bravinder had assumed there was potentially an ongoing struggle because police officers were still on top of Floyd.

But Bravinder and his partner soon discovered that Floyd was “unresponsive,” didn’t have a pulse and appeared to be in cardiac arrest.

According to Bravinder, the paramedics loaded Floyd into the ambulance in part to get away from the crowd of bystanders who appeared to be angry.

Bravinder’s partner, Derek Smith, testified that he checked Floyd’s pupils and determined that they were dilated, and that he also did not detect a pulse.

“In lay terms, I thought he was dead,” Smith said.

Smith later said there was no reason Minneapolis police could not have started chest compressions before emergency responders arrived. “Any lay person can do chest compressions,” he said.

Minnesota police sergeant believes restraint on Floyd went too far

Former Minneapolis Police Sgt. David Pleoger, a shift supervisor at the time of the incident, told prosecuting attorney Steve Schleicher that he believes the use of restraint on Floyd should have ended when he no longer resisted.

“Based on your review of the body-worn camera footage,” Schleicher asked Pleoger, “do you have an opinion as to when the restraint of Floyd should have ended in this encounter?”

“Yes,” Pleoger said.

“What is it?” Schleicher asked.

“When Floyd was no longer offering up any resistance to the officers,” Pleoger said.

Pleoger also testified that he did not know Floyd had died until he and the other officers who were involved in the incident went to Hennepin County Medical Center. It was there that Chauvin told Pleoger that he had knelt on Floyd’s neck, according to Pleoger’s testimony.

Biden’s infrastructure plan: The right blueprint for America?,"“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

President Biden on Wednesday unveiled a $2.25 trillion infrastructure plan that he called a “once-in-a-generation investment in America.”

The American Jobs Plan includes more than $600 billion in funds to repair and modernize the country’s roads, bridges, ports and rail systems. The proposal also calls for major investments to develop electric-vehicle infrastructure, expand high-speed internet to rural communities, build affordable housing, retrofit public buildings and upgrade the nation’s drinking water systems. The bill includes measures that go beyond the traditional definition of infrastructure, like $400 billion to improve caregiving for elderly people and people with disabilities, investments in research and development and the elimination of exclusionary zoning laws.

Biden proposes to pay for the plan by raising corporate tax rates and closing a number of corporate tax loopholes. According to the White House, these reforms will fully fund the American Jobs Plan over the next 15 years.

The release of Biden’s initial infrastructure proposal will likely lead to an extending period of negotiations that could change the substance of the bill dramatically before it reaches Congress for a vote. The broad concept of improving America’s infrastructure has significant support from members of both parties, and Democratic leaders have said they would like the final legislation to be bipartisan. But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday called this specific plan “the wrong prescription for America” and predicted it “is not going to get support from our side.”

Why there’s debate

Supporters of the plan have praised Biden for recognizing the massive investment they say is needed to restore America’s crumbling infrastructure and prepare the country for the economy of the future. They argue that the physical infrastructure projects in the bill will create millions of jobs, promote economic growth and help the U.S. transition to green energy. Others say that elements like clean water projects, elder care and rural broadband will address long-standing issues that stunt the country’s growth.

Story continues

A number of critics argue that America’s roads and bridges aren’t in nearly as bad shape as the bill’s proponents say and question the need for major federal infrastructure investment at all. Many on the right have echoed McConnell’s belief that Biden’s bill is a Trojan horse for Democratic policies that have little or nothing to do with actual infrastructure. Some say corporate tax hikes intended to pay for the plan will stifle the economy and reduce jobs.

Some on the left say Biden’s plan doesn’t go far enough. A group of progressive lawmakers have released their own infrastructure proposal that calls for $10 trillion in spending on green energy projects and climate justice initiatives over the next decade.

What’s next

Unlike the relatively swift process that was used to pass Biden’s coronavirus relief bill, negotiations on the infrastructure plan are expected to drag out well into the summer and possibly into the fall.

In the next few weeks, Biden is expected to unveil the second plank of his jobs agenda: A massive investment in what the administration is calling “human infrastructure.” That bill will reportedly include up to $2 trillion for education, childcare and other social programs.

Perspectives

Supporters

Poor infrastructure holds back the U.S. economy

“Most Americans, however, have little idea how far this country has fallen behind on meeting these needs. Yet, without modern infrastructure, the US cannot create decent jobs, social justice or climate safety. After decades of delay, now is the time for President Joe Biden to go big.” — Jeffrey Sachs, CNN

Biden’s plan will create millions of jobs

“A large-scale federal infrastructure investment program that is deliberately designed for maximum workforce impact can help accelerate reemployment, prevent scarring, and boost long-term inclusive and sustainable growth.” — Marcela Escobari, Dhruv Gandhi, and Sebastian Strauss, Brookings

Government projects can help the U.S. economy grow after the pandemic subsides

“We need to spend a lot to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, fight climate change, and more. And public investment can also be a major source of jobs and growth, helping to pull us out of the stagnation trap.” — Paul Krugman, New York Times

Biden is bringing back the era of big government after decades of neglect

“There are many reasons Biden is choosing, rightly, to do this now, when his Democratic predecessors were so much more cautious and incremental. The competitive and military threat from China, the nation’s demand for a burst of growth after the disaster of Covid-19, and the increasingly dire threat from climate change all figure into it. But the biggest reason is that the nation has come to a collective realization that the old industrial policy, fashioned in the late 1970s and 1980s, is no longer working.” — Noah Smith, Bloomberg

Though not technically infrastructure, investment in eldercare is desperately needed

“America is about to get hella old. And as someone with an aging mother, with whom I’ve had a lot of conversations about this stuff, planning long-term care is a really daunting proposition in this country. It’s a massive hole in our safety net.” — Jordan Weissmann, Slate

The plan will ultimately cost less than doing nothing

“Focusing on the size of the investment is misleading when you consider the high cost of not making it.” — Bernard L. Schwartz and David Rothkopf, USA Today

Critics

Biden’s plan is a liberal wish list disguised as an infrastructure bill

“The plan itself is really a big bait-and-switch. ... A fraction of the spending is actually devoted to traditional infrastructure projects that serve all people, such as roads, ports, schools and other public facilities. Meanwhile, hundreds of billions are set aside to build “affordable housing,” push power generation away from carbon-based fuels and promote union organizing.” — Henry Olsen, Washington Post

Throwing trillions of dollars at a problem isn’t the way to solve it

“It may be easy for many to believe that if Americans just summon the collective will to print trillions of dollars and/or tax it away from billionaires, the country can finally upgrade its infrastructure, do whatever it takes to achieve net zero carbon emissions and save the planet from a climate catastrophe. But it is not so simple.” — Mark Joffe, The Hill

The plan isn’t ambitious enough to address climate change

“While this plan represents some of the boldest thinking we’ve seen from the Democratic Party in the last decade, the fact is it’s not bold enough to defeat the crises facing our country now.” Sunrise Movement political director Evan Weber to Vox

The proposal lacks a cohesive vision

“In truth, Biden’s New American Jobs Plan has a kind of pray-and-spray quality to it, as if put together by a committee of publicly spirited people each of whom had their own view of what must be done for the environment, infrastructure and jobs. Each had a good idea, which was incorporated into the plan, but the ideas don't exactly cohere.” — Robert Reich, The HIll

A better plan would focus exclusively on traditional infrastructure

“The nation needs an infrastructure bill that focuses on infrastructure — and that means roads, bridges and the like. Unless the Biden administration reverses course, this isn’t it.” — Editorial, Las Vegas Review-Journal

Supporters exaggerate how damaged U.S. infrastructure really is

“Those clamoring for more infrastructure spending often claim that our roads and bridges and so on are ‘crumbling,’ and that infrastructure investment will ‘pay for itself’ in higher economic growth. Both of these claims are highly overstated.” — Robert Verbruggen, National Review

The federal government shouldn’t be funding infrastructure

“There is no need to subsidize infrastructure if it can be moved out of the government and supported by user fees. Rather than spending $2 trillion, we should privatize infrastructure where feasible and cut taxes and regulations on the rest.” — Chris Edwards, Washington Examiner

Georgia lawmaker arrested for knocking on Gov. Kemp's door calls possible 8-year prison term 'unfounded',"The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"With nods to FDR, JFK and LBJ, Biden goes big on infrastructure plan","President Biden traveled to Pittsburgh on Wednesday to introduce a $2.25 trillion infrastructure plan that, in both scope and cost, amounts to the most ambitious attempt by the federal government to refashion the nation’s economy and social fabric since at least Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society program of the 1960s.

As with many of his recent proposals, Biden framed the infrastructure plan as one of a superpower seeking to regain its footing, arguing that the investments the White House has outlined — $115 billion to repair roadways, $100 billion for high-speed internet and many other modernizing initiatives — would “put us in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming years.”

In his remarks, Biden noted that the United States was ranked 13th in the world when it came to the quality of its infrastructure. “Our adversaries are worried about us building this critical infrastructure,” the president said, likening his plan to the creation of the interstate highway system under Dwight Eisenhower and to the space race with the Soviet Union that John F. Kennedy vowed to win.

Biden’s ambitions are arguably broader, however, since the infrastructure plan seeks to address both reliance on carbon-based fuels and persistent racial inequalities in housing, transportation and other sectors. His prospects for passing the massive proposal may be helped by a sense of urgency arising from a pandemic that has revealed deep structural flaws in American society. Last summer’s racial justice protests, as well as increasingly frequent catastrophic weather events, have added urgency to the Democrats’ argument that simply patching up bridges will not do the trick.

Not that patching up bridges is absent from the plan: Biden says his plan will repair 10,000 bridges and 20,000 miles of roadway. His promise to “unclog traffic” could prove more ambitious than Kennedy’s bid to put humans on the moon (that is, if traffic ever returns to pre-pandemic levels, as it is generally expected to).

Story continues

It was significant, too, that Biden delivered his remarks in Pittsburgh, a onetime redoubt of the steel industry that has diversified its economy in recent years to include tech jobs. A native of Scranton, on the opposite side of Pennsylvania, Biden summoned the storied legacy of organized labor in the state. “It’s about time they started to get a piece of the action,” Biden said of labor unions, which could prove critical in helping him sell the plan. (Pennsylvania is also a state critical to Biden’s reelection prospects.)

Biden has been courting comparisons to both Johnson and Franklin D. Roosevelt, both of whom met fraught moments in American history with unbridled ambition. Like them, Biden will face spirited congressional opposition as well as a measure of public skepticism. Critics were already wondering, for example, why the infrastructure plan included $400 billion for “expanding access to quality, affordable home- or community-based care for aging relatives and people with disabilities.”

Funds allocated for electrical vehicle charging stations, replacement of lead pipes and upgrades to housing and schools met with similar suspicion from the right. In a Fox Business appearance on Tuesday, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wy., called the plan a “Trojan horse” for “more liberal spending and much higher taxes,” previewing what is emerging as a central argument from the Republican establishment.

“They want to do all sorts of social things,” Barrasso said of Biden and congressional Democrats.

Biden doesn’t have much hope of convincing Barrasso to vote for the package, known as the American Jobs Plan. But he does need to make sure that Barrasso does not persuade centrist senators Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., to also oppose the forthcoming bill. It may be with that in mind that Biden recently appointed Manchin’s wife to a committee on Appalachia’s future.

Much like Johnson, Biden comes to the Oval Office after having served on Capitol Hill, and if he never wielded quite as much influence, or engendered as much fear, as the legendary “Master of the Senate,” he nevertheless understands much better than either of his two direct predecessors the often unseemly business of turning a presidential proposal into a bill, then turning that bill into a law.

Biden intends to pay for the infrastructure plan by raising the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. The conservative Tax Foundation has already argued that such a tax hike would “erode American competitiveness and slow our economic recovery.” Spending for the infrastructure plan is expected to last eight years, while the tax increases needed to pay for that plan will be in place for 15.

Some progressives have said that the infrastructure plan should have been more ambitious; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for one, said that the plan should have been “way bigger.” The infrastructure plan does have a second component, the American Families Plan, which will include more social programs, and the details of which should become clear sometime in April or May. That second phase will also require a second tax hike that targets high-income individuals.

Overall, Democrats are plainly thrilled at the speed and scope of Biden’s plans. In her statement on the plan, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., who chairs the influential House Appropriations Committee, referenced Infrastructure Week, which during the Trump administration became a kind of running joke about the futility of actually addressing the nation’s infrastructure woes.

“We cannot simply return to normal,” DeLauro said, praising Biden’s “relentless focus on green energy.”

Biden’s first major legislative initiative was the American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus relief package unambiguously popular with the American public. Although no congressional Republicans supported the measure, they did not put up the kind of resistance that President Obama saw in 2009, when he introduced the Affordable Care Act.

It will now be up to Democratic leaders in Congress to craft a bill that hews to White House outlines while satisfying centrists and progressives alike and depriving Republicans of easy lines of attack like the one Barrasso and others have already been making. While those attacks may be predictable, they could prove effective in a deeply polarized nation, not to mention a Washington that allows little room for political error.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has also called the infrastructure bill a “Trojan horse” for progressive policies. And that was after a conversation on Tuesday with Biden, one of the few the former Senate adversaries have had in the last two months.

Biden believes that his plan is democratic as much as it is Democratic. He has frequently approached the presidency almost as a local politician might, focusing on policies that, while certainly ideological to a degree, he has sold as common-sense services delivered to his millions of constituents.

In his remarks on Tuesday, Biden said that it was critical to show the world that “democracies still deliver for their people,” as opposed, presumably, to engaging only in unproductive squabbling that has come to define Washington in the recent past.

“I believe we can,” Biden said. “I believe we must.""

3 takeaways from day 3 of the Derek Chauvin trial,"The Guardian

Prosecution has shown jury – and those watching at home via livestream – footage of the afternoon, the arrest and Floyd’s death A mural of George Floyd is seen next to Cup Foods in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 31 March. Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty Images The public has been able to livestream the murder trial of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin since Monday, as searing video of George Floyd and wrenching testimony from distressed witnesses who watched him die filled the court room and the senses of millions, from Minneapolis to the rest of the world. As the trial got fully under way, the prosecution showed the jury not only bystander video, with which many were familiar from but also a lot of never-before-seen footage showing various aspects of Floyd’s last afternoon, his arrest and his excruciating death as Chauvin kneeled on his neck last May. The prosecution has made it clear they will rely on using video of Floyd’s killing as the key tactic in their effort to secure a rare murder conviction of a white police officer for killing a Black person in America. “Believe your eyes,” prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told the jury during opening arguments on Monday. For many Minnesotans and Black people across the country, in particular, watching the videos of George Floyd’s final moments, as he begged and pleaded for mercy under the pressure of Chauvin and two other officers pinning him down, has acutely re-traumatized them. The prosecution also warned that, contrary to the long eight minutes and 46 seconds that prosecutors originally said was the length of time Chauvin’s knee was on Floyd’s neck, further evidence has shown it was actually even longer – nine minutes and 29 seconds. Some had watched footage at the time, but avoided it since; some had made a point of never watching it, perhaps until now. “For many, the nine minutes and 29 second [video] was the first time, not just jurors, but many viewers had seen that video in its entirety,” civil rights attorney Areva Martin told the Guardian. Abdulaziz Mohamed, the president-elect of the student body of the University of Minnesota, was in such disbelief when he first watched the original eight minutes and 46 seconds of bystander video last summer that he rewatched it multiple times and now is seeing it again at the trial. It’s unnerving. It just seems that we are being traumatized, over and over again Abdulaziz Mohamed “To say that it was traumatizing would be the understatement of the year. It’s unnerving. It just seems that we are being traumatized, over and over again,” he said. “It has to get to a point where we are able to collectively recognize not only trauma, but work to fight against a system that upholds and creates that trauma for us constantly,” Mohamed added. Chauvin denies the charges of murder and manslaughter and, as the defendant in his criminal trial, has been sitting in the courtroom all week in downtown Minneapolis, too, while footage and stills of him are being shown repeatedly. Dr Bula Wayessa, assistant professor of African American and African studies at the University of Minnesota, believes that watching the graphic content from the courtroom is important because it gives a wider range of viewers the chance to see what the Black community has experienced, despite its disturbing content. “I know the trauma will be with us for so many years to come and even for the generation to come,” he said. Wayessa said, however, that he saw the fear and a hopelessness in his 12-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter after they saw the video while watching television. He wasn’t emotionally ready to give any explanations, he said. For Areva Martin, who has been a practicing attorney for over two decades, and is based in Los Angeles, she had to prepare herself to watch. “I will be watching the trial from gavel to gavel. We will be watching those horrific moments, seconds and minutes when Chauvin is literally squeezing the life out of George. We are going to be watching that over and over again,” she said. Martin has been watching, she said, both with her attorney hat on and through her Black woman lens. She understands the trauma people endure when watching and rewatching the videos of Floyd’s death, she said. “It was heart-wrenching for me as a mother, as a wife, as a sister, as an African American to watch it,” she said. As the wife to her Black husband and the mother of her Black autistic son, Martin said she fears for the safety of the men in her life. “For every individual watching, especially if you’re African American, you can’t help but believe that that could be you or your loved one,” she said. Angi Porter, an attorney who lives in south Minneapolis where Floyd was killed, feels all too close to the events. She grew up being educated in civil rights history, she said, with her family being involved with the NAACP civil rights organization. She recalled seeing many pictures of lynching and the infamous images of Emmett Till in the pages of a magazine, and so pointed out it is not abnormal to be exposed to some of the gruesome, racially-motivated killings of Black people, via various media outlets throughout history. “It’s a common experience for Black children to be exposed to horrific images,” Porter said. “I think it is normal as a Black person to have this exposure but I wouldn’t say it’s any less traumatic each time.” Porter has been watching the trial since jury selection began in early March and applauds the prosecution for sharing videos of Floyd’s death because not all of the jury members had seen the video. “I, of course, watch that video and still feel my heart break each time,” Porter continued. “That could be my dad, my brother, my cousin, my friends because they are all Black men. That trauma doesn’t go away.” While some choose to watch the trial or read about it, others would rather avoid the trauma. “The thought of reliving the trauma of watching [Floyd] be killed over and over again … it’s really overwhelming to think about,” Victoria Millet, an associate in the equal opportunity and affirmative action office, also at the University of Minnesota, said. “I really try to avoid videos of Black bodied being brutalized.” She worries that traumatic videos will normalize and desensitize people to the deaths of Black bodies. We need this video evidence because I think it shed light on the atrocities that are happening, but as a Black person, it’s so difficult to see Victoria Millet “We need this video evidence because I think it shed light on the atrocities that are happening, but as a Black person, it’s so difficult to see,” said Millet, who lives five blocks away from where Floyd was killed. Millet’s husband has experienced nightmares from various videos of Black people being killed by police, she said. “As a Black man in America, it just cannot be healthy for him to walk through a world having those images burned into his head,” she said. But Millet admitted she also feels a sense of guilt for not watching. Meanwhile, Chauvin’s defense has been taking what some see as the route of exploiting racially-charged tropes, emphasizing earlier how Floyd was under the influence of drugs, was found to have drugs in his system, and whose struggle upon being arrested justified restraint, however unpleasant that was to witness. They intend to argue that it was the drugs and underlying health conditions that killed Floyd, despite the official autopsy concluding it was homicide. Areva Martin said that such strategies have been long used when there is a white officer and a Black victim. “The defense is you have an implicitly large Black male that is out of control because of drugs or alcohol and he is acting in such an erratic [fashion] that they must use extraordinary force to subdue him,” she said. Millet briefly watched the first day of testimony and then turned the live stream off when the defense started to attack Floyd’s character. “I thought that was really inappropriate,” she said. She added: “It’s really shifting the focus about who the trial is about in a way that I don’t think would happen if it were a white victim,” she said. Some observers expressed that what the world is now watching offers a sliver of insight into the experiences so many Black people have endured with police in America – and that the trial has the potential to hold a white officer accountable for a Black person’s death for the first time in Minnesota’s history. “In my mind [Chauvin’s] trial is a referendum on policing in America,” Martin said. “To finally say that police officers are not above the law, that they will face the same punishment as everyday citizens.”",
Kemp deputy expresses concerns about Georgia's new voting law: 'There were some things I didn't like',"Less than one week after Republicans in Georgia passed a controversial new election law, one of the state’s top GOP leaders expressed concern over portions of the bill he believes don’t make sense.

“There were some things I didn’t like in the law early on in the process and I spoke up really loudly about it,” Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan told Yahoo News. “I think an important part of this is about continuing to live around the mantra of making voting in Georgia easier to vote and harder to cheat.”

As lieutenant governor, Duncan presides over the state’s Senate and casts tie-breaking votes. With the measure passing in the Legislature on a party line vote, however, that wasn’t necessary. Still, Duncan takes issue with some of the provisions of the new law.

“I didn’t think it made sense for us to roll back no-excuse, absentee ballot voting,” Duncan said. “I felt like the early versions of the bill also limited Sunday voting. I didn’t think that was a really good position to take.”

“I [also] didn’t think it necessarily made sense [to not allow] water and food in line,” he added. “I think there were just better ways to do it.”

Following a record 5 million votes cast in the 2020 election cycle in Georgia, Duncan said he hopes for an even bigger turnout in 2024, something critics of Georgia’s new law say it was designed to prevent. Duncan also adds that Republicans in his state need to regain credibility by admitting the fact that former President Trump lost in 2020 “fair and square.”

“I think the best place for Republicans to start in any sort of election reform conversation is to start off by saying former President Donald Trump lost the election fair and square,” he said. “Now let’s go have a conversation about ways to modernize and update the way we vote here in Georgia.”

Despite his gripes about portions of the law, Duncan believes the passing of Senate Bill 202, now the Election Integrity Act of 2021, ensures future Georgia elections will be more secure than ever before with increased ID requirements and changes to early voting.

But Democrats say there was nothing wrong with the election laws, as evidenced by the law passing along strictly partisan lines. Instead, they contend, Republicans have rolled out the new law in direct response to Democrats winning the presidential race and Senate runoff elections.

“SB 202 suppresses voters, criminalizes compassion & seizes election authority from local + state officials,” Former Democratic House Leader Stacey Abrams tweeted on Thursday, shortly after Kemp signed the bill into law after it passed in the Republican-majority Senate. “Republicans passed & signed #SB202 to signal their capitulation to lies over truth. To fear over fairness. To suppression over participation.”

Now the courts will decide the law’s fate. As of Wednesday afternoon, three civil rights organizations — the New Georgia Project, the Black Voters Matter Fund and the Georgia NAACP — have filed separate legal challenges to the law saying it will disproportionately affect elderly voters and people of color.

“The thinly-veiled attempt to roll back the progress we have made to empower Georgians — to use their voices in the democratic process — creates an arbitrary law that does not improve voter confidence, secure election integrity nor increase access to the ballot box,” Rev. James Woodall, state president of Georgia NAACP, said in a statement.

The most glaring change enacted in the new law concerns absentee voting. The earliest that voters can now request a mail-in ballot is 77 days before an election, instead of the previous allotted 180 days. Additionally, the final deadline to complete an absentee ballot application was moved back a week. Republicans say those changes will cut down on the number of ballots rejected because of tight turnaround times.

GOP state Rep. Alan Powell said the new law brings uniformity to an electoral system that was severely stressed during the last election cycle.

“The Georgia election system was never made to be able to handle the volume of votes that it handled,” he told the New York Times. “What we’ve done in this bill in front of you is we have cleaned up the workings, the mechanics of our election system.”

Not surprisingly, Democrats disagree.

A record 1.3 million Georgians voted absentee in the general election, with then-candidate Joe Biden nearly doubling Trump’s total, receiving almost 850,000 votes compared to Trump’s 450,000. Democrats see the tightening of restrictions as a form of retaliation. The new provisions, progressives argue, suppresses the vote for marginalized communities, including Black Georgians who turned out in record numbers in the most recent election cycle, some of whom relied on longer turnaround times to return their ballots.

Nikema Williams, Georgia’s newest Democratic congresswoman, told CNN on Sunday that she believes the state’s recent progressive wins is fueling a GOP backlash.

“Republicans are pushing back and they’re upset that we were able to win,” she said. “And so they’re going to do everything in their power right now to restrict access to people who mainly look like me from voting.”

The new election law also has new voter ID requirements for requesting and returning a ballot. Applicants must now include their driver's license number, state ID number or a copy of another acceptable voter ID. But many poor Georgians and people of color who live in rural communities do not have a state-issued ID, potentially excluding them from participating in future elections.

Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of Georgia’s two new Democratic senators, questioned the motivations of Republican leaders who support this law.

“You are literally going to make public policy based on a lie, based on the feeling that some people have that things didn’t turn out the way they should have turned out?” Warnock said at an event in Atlanta Friday. “Is that how we make public policy?”

In defending the new law, Kemp said Tuesday that it “expands access” to voting.

“I think when people get educated on the bill and are not subjected to people misleading them on the other side about what this bill actually does,” he told NPR Tuesday, “I think they’ll have good understanding of why the General Assembly took the actions that they did.”

One bright spot in the new law cited by proponents and critics of the legislation is that it extends early voting opportunities, making Saturday voting mandatory while keeping Sunday hours optional. In addition, counties can now have early voting hours lasting up to 12 hours a day, with a minimum of eight hours.

But another point of contention in the law are its changes to the State Election Board. The secretary of state will no longer chair the board and the new chair would be appointed by a majority of lawmakers in the state House and Senate. Current Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger, a Republican, came under fire following the 2020 election when he disputed Trump’s false claims of voter fraud in the presidential election, and did not go along with pressure not to certify the results.

Duncan believes Raffensperger is getting pushed aside for the “appeasement” of those who buy into the “conspiracy” that Trump should have one in 2020.

“The only thing [Raffensperger is] guilty of is being former president’s scapegoat,” Duncan said.

Under the new law, the State Elections Board will now have more power to intervene in county elections boards that are deemed “underperforming,” which many feel leaves room for Republicans to overturn future elections that don’t go their way.

Hillary Holley, organizing director of Fair Fight, a grassroots nonprofit that encourages voter participation, believes that if these laws were in place in 2020, Republicans would have been able to stop the election from being certified and overturned the election in favor of Trump.

“They are trying to change the fundamental way elections work and that shouldn’t be a partisan issue,” Holley told Yahoo News.

Republican Rep. Barry Fleming, a key voice in creating the law, called the provision a “temporary fix, so to speak, that ends and the control is turned back over to the locals after the problems are resolved.”

With the repercussions of Georgia’s new election law still being debated and its legality soon to be argued in court, Duncan said that Republicans need to get back to focusing on the challenges already facing their constituents, rather than creating new ones.

“We’ve got to dive into communities and understand the real problems,” he said. “We can't just use 280 characters to demonize people all over the country, if not the world, if we want to convince folks to vote for us.”

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

What you need to know about the Matt Gaetz scandal,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has said a Justice Department inquiry into him for an alleged relationship with a 17-year-old girl is part of an extortion attempt against his family.

The New York Times reported Tuesday that Gaetz, 38, was under investigation for possibly paying for a 17-year-old to cross state lines and then have sex with him about two years ago. Gaetz could be charged under the Mann Act, which prohibits bringing anyone across state lines ""with intent that such individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.""

The age of sexual consent in Florida is 18, and Gaetz has not been charged with any crimes at the state or federal level.

The investigation was opened last year during President Donald Trump’s administration, which took the allegations against Gaetz seriously, according to Katie Benner, an author of the story who covers the Justice Department for the Times.

After the report was published, Gaetz told Axios, “The allegations against me are as searing as they are false. I believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to criminalize my sexual conduct, you know when I was a single guy.""

Gaetz claimed he and his family were actually working with the FBI because they had ""been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million while threatening to smear my name."" Gaetz’s father, Donald, is a former president of the Florida state Senate.

""We have been cooperating with federal authorities in this matter, and my father has even been wearing a wire at the FBI’s direction to catch these criminals,"" Gaetz said.

The former DOJ official in question is attorney David McGee, who in a Washington Post interview denied any involvement other than saying that the elder Gaetz had reached out to talk to him on a subject about which McGee would not elaborate. McGee said he wasn’t involved in the Justice Department investigation or any attempts to extort the family.

Story continues

“It is completely false. It’s a blatant attempt to distract from the fact that he’s under investigation for sex trafficking of minors,” McGee said, adding, “I have no connection with that case at all, other than [being] one of a thousand people who have heard the rumors.”

Gaetz went on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show Tuesday evening to further explain his situation, saying that the girl in the Times story “doesn’t exist.”

“I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old,” Gaetz said. “That is totally false. The allegation is, I read it in the New York Times, is that I've traveled with some 17-year-old in some relationship. That is false, and records will bear that out to be false.”

“Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you’re dating who are of legal age is not a crime,” he said.

During the Carlson interview, the congressman said the extortion attempt began on March 16 when “people were talking about a minor and that there were pictures of me with child prostitutes. That’s obviously false. There will be no such pictures, because no such thing happened.”

Gaetz attempted to pull Carlson into the story, telling him, “I can say that, actually, you and I went to dinner about two years ago, your wife was there, and I brought a friend of mine, you'll remember her. And she was actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn't cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme that she could face trouble.”

“I don't remember the woman you're speaking of,” Carlson said, “or the context at all.”

Later in the broadcast, Carlson noted, “That was one of the weirdest interviews I’ve ever conducted.”

“I don’t think that clarified much, but it certainly showed this is a deeply interesting story,” he added.

The Gaetz allegations appear to have sprung from an investigation into Joel Greenberg, a onetime Florida Republican official who was indicted last summer on 14 charges, including sex trafficking a minor, using a state database to create fake IDs and stalking a political opponent. A 2017 photo showed Greenberg, a former Seminole County tax collector, with Gaetz and Republican operative Roger Stone. Greenberg also posted a photo with Gaetz outside the White House to his Twitter account in 2019.

Gaetz was elected in 2016 and represents the state’s First Congressional District, which includes much of the Florida Panhandle. He’s been an outspoken Trump supporter and cable news fixture who has made headlines for stunts like wearing a gas mask when Congress was discussing COVID-19 legislation in March 2020.

Hours before the New York Times story on the investigation was published, Axios reported that Gaetz was considering an early retirement from Congress to take a position with the conservative outlet Newsmax. Gaetz is engaged to Ginger Luckey, 26, whom he proposed to on Dec. 30 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.

In 2017, Gaetz was the only ""no"" vote on a human trafficking bill that was passed unanimously by the Senate and by a 418-1 count in the House.

Republicans go to war over vaccine passports,"Several prominent Republicans are sounding the alarm over a Biden administration initiative to partner with private companies to develop a so-called vaccine passport, which would offer proof that a person had been inoculated against COVID-19.

While the idea behind the passports is that businesses like restaurants, sporting venues, airlines and retail outlets could use them to hasten a return to normal operation, the fear among some Republicans is that curtailing the ability of nonvaccinated persons to reenter everyday life represents a form of government tyranny.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who in recent months has become perhaps the most prominent GOP governor in the country, said Monday that he would sign an executive order prohibiting the use of vaccine passports in the state.

“We are not supporting doing any vaccine passports in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said at a news conference. “It’s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.”

Like those in most U.S. states, Florida's public schools and daycare centers require students to be vaccinated for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox and other diseases before being allowed to attend. While religious exemptions are permitted, the science behind vaccinating schoolkids before allowing them to congregate in classrooms is the same when it comes to businesses and COVID-19.

The state of Hawaii, which has required that COVID-19 tests be given to all travelers, is now considering using an app that would display a person’s vaccination status without divulging other health information.

“They would be able to verify the health record, they would then encrypt it so people can’t steal someone’s health record. Although really, all it is is whether you got vaccinated or not and your name and the date it occurred,"" Josh Green, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, told KHON2.

Story continues

On Tuesday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky announced that studies have confirmed that those who are fully vaccinated pose little or no threat of spreading COVID-19.

“Our data from the CDC today suggest that vaccinated people do not carry the virus,” Walensky said.

Yet for several Republicans, what stands out about vaccine passports is that they could restrict what those who refuse to be inoculated could do.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, said in a statement to Fox News that getting vaccinated is a personal decision and that attempts to limit freedoms to travel or frequent businesses represent creeping authoritarianism.

“Vaccine credentials would be a complete government overstep. Individuals in America have a personal responsibility for their health,” Sessions told Fox News. “Implementing a ‘vaccine passport’ runs the risk of undermining public trust and substantially limiting normal day-to-day essential activities.”

While being vaccinated drastically reduces the possibility of being infected with COVID-19, the risk doesn’t disappear completely, although severe illness and death from the disease become next to nonexistent. If not enough people get vaccinated, however, the U.S. population won't reach the herd immunity threshold that protects those who, for other health reasons, cannot be vaccinated for COVID-19. And with the virus continuing to circulate — new U.S. cases are up 20 percent over the last 14 days — the chance that it could mutate to a degree that renders current vaccines less effective is more likely.

Yet those health concerns seem secondary for Republicans like Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, who, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, has not shied away from dramatic analogies when asked about vaccine passports.

“Proposals like these smack of 1940s Nazi Germany. We must make every effort to keep America from becoming a ‘show your papers society,’” Cawthorn told Fox News. “The Constitution and our founding principles decry this type of totalitarianism.”

However, there are already statutes at the federal level that require people to be vaccinated against various infectious diseases in some cases. Under current federal law, for example, “a foreign national who applies for an immigrant visa abroad, or who seeks to adjust status to a permanent resident while in the United States,” must show proof of vaccination for mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, haemophilus influenzae type B and hepatitis B.

In some ways, the concerns over vaccine passports mirror the reluctance by some Republicans to enforce social distancing restrictions or follow mask mandates.

“What we’ve seen in this pandemic is that anything can be politicized, whether it’s a mask or vaccine, whatever it might be,” Lawrence Gostin, director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Center, told Business Insider. “But the truth is that vaccines are not only our best way out of this pandemic, they’re our only way out of this pandemic — because it’s clear that we can’t change our behavior.”

WHO's 'not credible' coronavirus report angers scientists and politicians alike,"WASHINGTON — A new report from the World Health Organization that seeks to uncover the origins of the coronavirus pandemic has been met with strong skepticism from Washington, all but ensuring that the question of how the pathogen emerged would remain a nagging issue for President Biden.

The most critical — and criticized — assertion made by WHO investigators was that it was “extremely unlikely” that the virus proliferated “through a laboratory incident.” Even though most scientists do not believe that the virus can be traced back to a laboratory, a significant number claim that the WHO has not convincingly shown that one of several more likely scenarios did take place.

“The lab leak hypothesis is alive and well,” said Stanford microbiologist David A. Relman in an email to Yahoo News. “This report contributes almost nothing to our understanding of that hypothesis.”

Released on Tuesday, the report says that a “zoonotic spillover” — for example, a fruit bat biting a human in the wilderness — was either possible or likely. Frozen meat was deemed a “possible” vehicle for the virus, which could reignite concerns about how thoroughly China regulates the production and sale of animals, especially those that belong to more exotic species. The most likely scenario, researchers said, was of the virus entering the human species through an “intermediate host,” such as a pangolin.

Questions about the etiology of the virus have as much to do with geopolitics as they do with science. Those questions come as the relationship between China and the United States seems to grow more strained by the day. On the same day that the report was issued, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China’s treatment of its Uyghur population, an ethnic minority that adheres to the Islamic faith, amounted to “genocide.”

When the WHO declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, 2020, Joe Biden was just beginning to pull ahead in the Democratic primaries; he would conduct most of his general campaign against then-President Donald Trump from his home in Delaware. Now that he is the president, Biden has decided to confront China on a number of issues, including trade and human rights. Among those issues is the role the East Asian superpower may have played in concealing — and thus worsening — the pandemic in its earlier stages, sometime in late 2019.

Story continues

Trump left the WHO, bitter at what he perceived as pro-China bias. Biden has returned the United States to the fold as part of his broader America-is-back approach to foreign policy. Yet his administration is as unwilling as Trump’s to endorse the WHO’s work when it comes to the pandemic. Biden’s objections may be far less bellicose, or conspiratorial, but they speak to a fraying of the Washington-Beijing relationship that has continued with the changeover in presidential administrations.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki addressed the 120-page report during a Tuesday briefing. “The report lacks crucial data, information and access,” she said. “It represents a partial and incomplete picture.”

A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington pointed Yahoo News to remarks made by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. “The Chinese side offered necessary facilitation for the team's work, fully demonstrating its openness, transparency and responsible attitude,” Hua said on Tuesday.

“Study of origins is also a global mission that should be conducted in multiple countries and localities,” Hua added, saying she hoped that the WHO report would “stimulate global cooperation in origin-tracing.” It is not clear that there are any serious efforts underway to trace the coronavirus to a nation other than China.

As with much else, the president’s nearly half-century in Washington is bound to inform his response today. In 1986, Biden was a third-term U.S. senator from Delaware when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant suffered a partial meltdown in the Soviet Union. Speaking on the Senate floor a week after the devastating explosion, Biden called the “expanding disaster” taking place in the Ukrainian countryside “an incredible event almost beyond comprehension.”

Now he has an “incredible event” of his own, one that — like Chernobyl — pits the United States against a cloistered superpower seen by a growing number of Americans as a threat.

Republicans eagerly blasted the WHO as kowtowing to Beijing.

“No one should be surprised that the WHO report on the origins of COVID-19 is misleading and incomplete,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the senior Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Yahoo News. “Either through sheer incompetence, gross negligence or outright corruption, the WHO helped the CCP hide the truth about COVID-19’s severity and transmissibility from the very beginning,” he added, referring to the Chinese Communist Party and long-standing concerns over its influence. (In 1986, U.S. officials accused the Soviet Union of a similar cover-up in Chernobyl.)

Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused China’s communist leaders of “obstruction of a thorough investigation,” which he said was “shameful but unsurprising.”

At issue is whether visiting virologists had all the access they needed in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei province, where cases of COVID-19 were first identified. The investigation was conducted by 17 Chinese scientists and an additional 17 scientists from abroad. But since China had final approval over the composition of the international team, some have questioned the baseline integrity of the effort.

“The World Health Organization has not produced a credible report,” said Richard Ebright, director of the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University. He described the scientists behind the report as “hand-picked stooges” who had neither the permission nor the willingness to fully hold Chinese scientists and officials to account.

Ebright and others have voiced alarm that among the investigators was Dr. Peter Daszak, a British zoologist who runs the EcoHealth Alliance in New York. Daszak has ties to the very lab from which some believe the virus escaped. Last year, the National Institutes of Health suspended Daszak’s funding because of concerns about his ties to China.

Daszak has been a constant presence on American media outlets including, in recent days, NPR and PBS, describing the WHO investigation as thorough and, to a large extent, conclusive. That has infuriated observers like Ebright, who say that such confidence is profoundly unwarranted.

""There's no evidence provided for any assertions,"" Ebright said. (Daszak did not respond to a Yahoo News request for comment.)

Even the head of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, appears to agree with such criticisms, complaining earlier this week that the researchers he sent to China had “difficulties” in “accessing raw data."" He deemed the product of their investigation “not extensive enough,” suggesting that more on-the-ground research was needed, including into the lab-leak hypothesis.

The most contentious assertion in the new report is one that scientists both in the United States and abroad have been making for a year: that the coronavirus did not originate at the Wuhan Institute of Virology or a similar scientific establishment in central China. That assertion has been questioned by skeptics who believe that an accident at the virology institute may have allowed the virus to “escape.”

Critics of Tuesday’s report may not have evidence to support that hypothesis, but they argue that the WHO does not have evidence to discount the possibility of a leak, either.

“The WHO team essentially appears to have abdicated any real role in looking carefully at a lab leak hypothesis,” said Relman, the Stanford microbiologist. “All they seem to have done is ask some labs and lab scientists whether they could have been the source of a leak, and were told no. This is not a scientific investigation by any stretch of the imagination.”

Trump was among those who subscribed to the notion that the virus — for which he used racist terms like “Chinese virus” and “kung flu” — came from a laboratory, though he never cited evidence to that effect. His anti-Chinese insinuations have been blamed for a rise in attacks against Asian Americans, including a brutal attack on Tuesday against a woman in midtown Manhattan. At the same time, those insinuations have made it difficult for scientists to discuss the origins of the virus without invoking, however inadvertently, Trump’s divisive rhetoric.

“I think the conclusion that it resulted from animal reservoirs is likely correct,” Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, told Yahoo News. But, he said, Tuesday’s report “won’t close the door” on questions that have remained without satisfying answers even as the pandemic enters its second year.

Nearly 3 million people worldwide have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The economic devastation has also been pronounced; the pandemic will ultimately cost the United States $16 trillion, a Congressional Budget Office study has found.

That has made people eager to find someone to blame for the coronavirus. Last June, a group of 25 Nigerians sued China for “volatility of the market leading to a decline in investment.” They sought $200 billion. The following months, China was sued by Missouri.

"'Skullduggery' political podcast: Prosecuting the police — March 31, 2021","The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"Witnesses at Derek Chauvin trial recount anguish, helplessness watching George Floyd's death","Almost a year after witnessing George Floyd’s death beneath the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, some of the bystanders who watched Floyd die testified Tuesday that they felt helpless as the fateful incident unfolded.

When asked about her emotions at not being able to render aid to Floyd, Genevieve Hansen, a Minneapolis firefighter who filmed the incident while off-duty, broke down in tears and said she was “totally distressed.”

“There was a man being killed,” she said, under questioning from the prosecution. “And had I had access to a call similar to that, I would have been able to provide medical attention to the best of my abilities, and this human was denied that right.”

Hansen was among five witnesses called Tuesday — all of them bystanders at the Cup Foods convenience store when Floyd died on May 25 — who testified in Chauvin’s murder trial. The trial is expected to last several weeks and could include hundreds of witnesses.

None of the bystanders who testified Tuesday knew who Floyd was before he died. But most of them seemed pained when they were asked to recount what they saw and witnessed that day. At times during the testimony, some sparred with Eric Nelson, Chauvin’s attorney, whose line of questioning seemed to suggest that the bystanders had made it more difficult for the police officers gathered at the scene to do their job.

Nelson asked Hansen, a firefighter for about two years, if she would be distracted if she had 20 or so people yelling at her or threatening her while trying to perform her duties.

“I know my job and I would be confident in doing my job and there’s nothing anybody can say that would distract me,” she replied emphatically.

Under questioning from Nelson, Hansen admitted that she’d grown angry and at one point called the officers a ""bitch.""

“There was no point in trying to reason with them because they’d just killed somebody,” she said.

Nelson also had a tense exchange with Donald Williams, a student of martial arts who was at the scene when Floyd died. Nelson asked Williams about insults he had directed at the officers during the incident.

Story continues

“You called [Chauvin] a tough guy, right?” Nelson asked. “You called him a bum at least 13 times.”

“I did,” Williams said, later adding that he remained controlled during the encounter.

Earlier, Williams testified that he was scared for his own safety as he pleaded with Chauvin to take his knee off Floyd’s neck — and that he called 911 after Chauvin did not respond to him.

“I did call the police on the police,” Williams said. “Because I believe I witnessed a murder.”

Another witness, Darnella Frazier, whose footage of Floyd was viewed by millions, indicated that she remained haunted by the scene after Floyd’s death. “It’s been nights I stayed up apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life,” she said. “But it’s like, it’s not what I should have done, it’s what [Chauvin] should have done.”

Another witness, Alyssa Funari, who was 17 at the time of the incident, also expressed regret.

“It was difficult because I felt like there wasn’t anything I could do as a bystander,” Funari said. “I felt like I was failing.”

Funari said she had driven to Cup Foods with her friend to purchase an aux cord for her car when she noticed the police presence. She testified that when she walked toward the store, she saw four police officers and Floyd on the ground.

Funari, who had started recording the incident, said she heard Floyd say “he couldn’t breathe and that his stomach hurt and that he wanted his mom.” Floyd “looked like he was struggling,” she said. “He looked like he was fighting to breathe.”

In his opening statement on Monday, Nelson sought to counter the narrative that Floyd was completely at the mercy of the officers. He described Floyd as combative and resistant, and said the evidence will show that, when confronted by police, he “put drugs in his mouth in an effort to conceal them” from the officers.

Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death.

Report: Rep. Matt Gaetz under investigation for sexual relationship with 17-year-old,"The New York Times

NEW YORK — For New York City’s economy, the last 12 months have amounted to one long, brutal winter. The pandemic forced the shutdown of most of the city’s businesses, wiped out hundreds of thousands of jobs and kept away tens of millions of tourists. By many measures, the nation’s biggest city suffered the greatest losses and faces one of the longest and steepest climbs back. Shows will not return to Broadway stages until after Labor Day, and many workers will not begin commuting to the office and buying lunch at the corner deli for months, if they return at all. But for the first time since the city went on lockdown late last March, there are palpable signs of rebirth, fueled by a growing supply of COVID-19 vaccines and an impending gusher of federal aid to City Hall, the schools, the transit system, restaurants and theaters. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Shoots of the budding optimism pop up almost daily: The Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking Central Park called back workers for a reopening this week. Union Square Café, a popular Manhattan restaurant that had been closed for months, is feeding diners again. Fans were in the stands again when the New York Yankees opened their season in the Bronx on Thursday, though limited to one-fifth of the seats. The city’s outlook has improved as result of the latest stimulus bill, financial analysts say, which included about $6 billion in direct aid to the city government, $6.5 billion to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and $4 billion to the city’s public schools. “There’s a lot of cash that’s going to come in fairly quickly here,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It’s going to provide big pops to places that have been more or less shut down.” The federal aid will help solve some of the city’s biggest short-term problems, including huge drops in revenue from property and sales taxes and fares that the MTA, which runs the subway, buses and two commuter rails, is heavily dependent on. Still, the road to full recovery will be long and steep, business leaders and analysts say. Entire industries, including the arts, hotels and restaurants, were decimated, with thousands of businesses closing for good. Tourism, a pillar of the economy, is years away from rebounding, according to forecasts. And many companies are making at least some remote work a permanent feature, raising questions about the future of Manhattan without legions of office workers. “The city still has a ways to go,” said Ana Champeny, director of city studies for the Citizens Budget Commission. “You’ve got to get commuters back in Midtown and downtown, the business district. You’ve got to get restaurants and theaters reopened.” The infusion of federal aid has provided some reason for hope. The MTA has gone from threatening to sharply reduce service and lay off workers to promising to restore 24-hour subway service, which was suspended during the pandemic. Many restaurants that struggled to survive through a monthslong ban on indoor dining can try to recoup losses and the costs of adapting to pandemic restrictions. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader from New York, said the aid that will flow to New York state and its residents from the stimulus bill, known as the American Rescue Plan, amounted to nearly $100 billion. Mayor Bill de Blasio will lay out a plan for spending the direct aid when he presents his budget in April, said a spokeswoman, Laura Feyer. The mayor said the aid would enable the city “to finally overcome the massive revenue loss and to serve our people, keep our workforce strong, bring our city back.” The direct local aid “can put the city on solid fiscal footing,” said Champeny, though the city still faces large budget deficits in future years. “It is an incredibly generous package that will definitely start the rebuild.” The rebuild faces formidable challenges. The New York metropolitan area lost more than 1 million jobs in 2020, close to double the Los Angeles area’s loss and triple the Chicago area’s, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The city’s official unemployment rate rose to 12.9% in February, more than double the national rate, which was 6.2% in February and fell to 6% in March.) The job losses fell harder on those who were clinging to the lower rungs of the city’s economic ladder. Low-paying jobs that cannot be done from home accounted for most of the losses, and many may not come back for years, if ever, economists said. New York was especially vulnerable to the pandemic’s economic pummeling because of its heavy reliance on tourists and business travelers to fill hotel beds and seats in restaurants, theaters and stadiums. The number of foreign visitors to New York is not expected to reach its 2019 level before 2025, according to the city’s tourism promotion agency. New York’s office towers are still largely empty, and the exodus of office workers from Manhattan — many of whom are not expected to return until the last half of the year — has crippled merchants and significantly reduced the value of much of the city’s commercial real estate, which will translate into a big drop in sales and property tax revenue. The city’s Independent Budget Office projected that the city’s recovery would remain “fragile and tentative for many more months.” Though a snapback in hiring this year and next would replace about 400,000 of the jobs the city lost, the budget office said that by the end of 2024 New York would still not have as many jobs as it did before the pandemic started. More than 200 of the city’s 700 hotels remain closed, leaving thousands of workers still unemployed, said Vijay Dandapani, chief executive of the Hotel Association of New York City. “My industry fell off a cliff on March 22 last year,” he said. Many hotel operators have received no federal aid during the pandemic, and nearly half are in default on their mortgages, Dandapani said. More than 40 hotels have fallen behind on their property tax payments to the city, which could put them in “a downward spiral” that they cannot escape, he added. But even the beleaguered hotel business is seeing glimmers of recovery. The Mandarin Oriental rehired more than 100 members of the Hotel Trades Council union for its reopening on Thursday, the hotel’s manager, Susanne Hatje, said. The Mandarin is offering discounted rates starting at $716 per night, 20% below prepandemic prices. The nearby Park Hyatt also reopened on Thursday, and other hotels are expected to join the trend as tourists trickle back. During the week that ended March 20, the city’s hotels had an occupancy rate of 50.8%, the highest in more than a year, according to STR, an industry research firm. Tourism may start to pick up slightly by late summer if fans return to the stands at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens. And if delegates come back to Manhattan in September for the United Nations General Assembly, hotels may fill more rooms. The city’s tourism promotion agency, NYC & Co., has forecast that the number of visitors will climb to 38 million this year, up from about 23 million in 2020, but still down about 40% from a record high level in 2019. Despite the city’s precarious situation, E.J. McMahon, founder of the Empire Center, a conservative research group, said he was wary about the extraordinary amount of federal aid flowing to the region. The pandemic’s impact on New York’s economy appears to be much deeper and longer lasting than the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack two decades ago, he said. “There’s going to be a hangover from this, a significant hangover.” Still, McMahon questioned, “What it is that government can do to actually re-create the economy?” Many of the lost jobs, such as cleaning hotel rooms and serving food, did not require much skill or extensive training, he said. “There’s a lot of potential here for problems and abuse of the money.” But James A. Parrott, an economist at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School, argued that the city should use some of the federal aid to retrain workers who have lost their jobs. “Tens of thousands of jobs will permanently disappear, and the city needs to do more to preserve the businesses that are trying to hang on,” Parrott said. “The city has never had a challenge on this scale before.” The restaurant business is one important part of New York’s private-sector economy that will benefit directly from the stimulus bill. The bill included more than $28 billion for restaurants across the nation that have been among the businesses worst hit by the pandemic’s economic fallout. A sizable chunk of that aid will likely go to New York’s restaurants because they experienced some of the longest and most severe restrictions, said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group. A recent survey by the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, estimated that 5,000 restaurants in the city had shut down for good during the pandemic. “This will save countless restaurants and jobs,” Rigie said. “It’s horrible that restaurants had to wait a year for this funding, but better late than never.” While it may take some time, “the city is going to see a big revival,” Zandi said. “It’s going to come roaring back.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
White House: Biden committed to nominating 1st Black woman to Supreme Court,"National Review

In a televised “townhall,” President Biden let it slip that he had never been in the White House residence until he himself became president. This, despite having been vice president for eight years, as you know. He also said: Living in the White House is much different from living at the vice-presidential spread. At the latter, you got lots of room, and you can go out and do things. The White House, however, is like a “gilded cage.” Also, people wait on you at the White House. They hand you your suit coat and so forth. “I find myself extremely self-conscious,” said Biden. “I don’t know about you-all, but I was raised in the way that you didn’t look for anybody to wait on you.” Being in the White House gives you a sense of history, or ought to, I guess. “I’m not Abraham Lincoln,” said Biden. “I’m not Franklin Roosevelt. How do I deal with these problems?” The business about not having been in the White House residence reminded me of George W. Bush — early, early in his first term. The second week, in fact. The first movie he screened was Thirteen Days, the Kevin Costner flick about the Cuban Missile Crisis. The new president invited members of the Kennedy family to watch the movie with him. So, that was February 2001. As I recall, Ted Kennedy and some of the others had not been invited to the residence since JFK’s assassination, almost 40 years before. The invitation was very, very Bush. Listen to Chris Matthews, in a column: Call me traditional, but this is how a first family should use this country’s most cherished house. Matthews further said, This is American government at its best. A Republican president pays tribute to a Democratic family and, in so doing, builds goodwill for his legislative agenda. A conservative with one set of values and loyalties exploits the grandeur of the White House to forge a workaday bond with the country’s most prominent liberal. (The last reference was to Ted.) Matthews went on to bash George W. Bush’s predecessor, Bill Clinton, for having no sense of historical responsibility over the house. “He treated the White House as a fund-raising casino,” Matthews said. And this is how his column ended: I remember sitting at dinner in the inaugural weeks of 1993 alongside a young Clinton aide who laughed aloud at something said by the man her guy had defeated, the senior George Bush. “He was asked what was the greatest thing about being president,” she hooted with loud mockery, “and he said ‘The honor of it.’” She thought the old man’s sentiment was beyond contempt. I believe that one of the first good things the younger Bush can do is bring it back. Yes, the honor of it. Very, very important. • When I was doing a little reading about living in the White House, I came across a fact, rather startling: Barron Trump was the first boy to live in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr., more than 50 years before. Plenty of girls — but no boys. • Here is President Biden on Xi Jinping: “He doesn’t have a democratic — with a small ‘d’ — bone in his body, but he’s a smart, smart guy.” Yes. • The meeting in Anchorage between U.S. officials and Chinese officials was “admirably acrimonious,” said George F. Will. I agree. And let me review a couple of remarks. In advance of the meeting, the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said, “Our relationship with China will be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be.” I think of a Buckley phrase: “neatly formulated.” Blinken went on to say, “And we will engage China from a position of strength.” In Anchorage, Blinken’s counterpart, Wang Yi, said, “I don’t think the overwhelming majority of countries in the world would recognize the universal values advocated by the United States.” My chief concern is: Do a majority of Americans recognize those values? • Let’s pause for a language note, as I sometimes do in this funny column. Above, I said, “Do a majority” — do you prefer “Does a majority”? In English, it’s either-eyether. • A headline reminded me of the Soviet Union: “Hong Kong activist Andy Li held at psychiatric hospital in secret after return from mainland.” (To read the article, go here.) Yes, that’s what they did back in the USSR: They held dissidents and critics in psychiatric hospitals, usually torturing them, sometimes to death. The CCP and the CPSU are indeed cousins. • In 2015, I wrote an article called “A Question of Honor: As the wolves circle, Iraqis who helped us are pleading for visas.” For The Atlantic, George Packer has now written an article called “A Debt of Honor: The U.S. must fulfill its responsibilities to the Afghans who put their trust and lives in American hands.” We screwed the Vietnamese. We screwed the Iraqis. We will screw the Afghans. It is very, very dangerous to be a friend of the United States, as Bernard Lewis and many others have observed — often more dangerous than being an enemy. • Bill Browder — father of the Magnitsky acts — tweeted the following: Alexey Navalny has gone on a hunger strike to protest the sadistic denial of medical care for his crippling back problems. Putin is trying to kill him in slow motion. I saw the same exact thing with Sergei Magnitsky. Yes. • Last summer, Russian agents poisoned Navalny with the military nerve agent Novichok. Ultimately, he was saved in a hospital in Germany. Before that, he was treated in an emergency room in Omsk, a city in Siberia. Recently, two heads of that hospital have died suddenly — unexpectedly. I think of one of my favorite lines from Garry Kasparov: “I believe in coincidences, but I also believe in the KGB.” • Did you see this headline in the Wall Street Journal? “Russian Disinformation Campaign Aims to Undermine Confidence in Pfizer, Other Covid-19 Vaccines, U.S. Officials Say.” Yeah, of course. What a sick m.o., IMO. (For the Journal article, go here.) • “So, you know Vladimir Putin,” said George Stephanopoulos to President Biden. “You think he’s a killer?” “Mmm hmm, I do,” answered Biden. This was in sharp contrast to Biden’s predecessor. To refresh your memory: The first time Donald Trump was asked about Putin and killing, he said, “Well, I think our country does plenty of killing also.” The other time he was asked about it, he said, “What, you think our country’s so innocent?” Conservatives used to call this “moral equivalence,” back in the bad old days. In reaction to Biden’s comment, Putin recalled his ambassador, and he challenged Biden to a debate. Many a democrat — note the small “d” — said that Putin ought to debate his political opponents in Russia, rather than imprisoning them. On Fox and so on, some righties were chortling that Putin would clean Biden’s clock, etc. Did you see Adam Kinzinger’s comment? He, as you know, is a renegade Republican congressman from Illinois (and a former Air Force pilot): Russia is not our ally; Putin is a murderer. He’s a tyrant who targets freedom-loving people & their elections. He helped Assad kill over 50k children in Syria & tortured activists in Belarus. He sows chaos & acts with impunity across the globe. I’m rooting for America, always. Kinzinger talks like a Republican from the bad old days. He ought to be in a museum or something. • I would like to quote Alon Ben-Meir. He is a veteran international-relations expert, born in Baghdad. In 2019, I did a podcast with him, writing about it in a blogpost, here. The other day, he tweeted, The ten-year-old civil war in Syria has gone far beyond tragic mass devastation. Innocent children, women, and men should not die from starvation when their only crime is, they were born in the wrong place at the wrong time. Yes. In my experience, no one gives a rat’s about the Syrians (except the Syrians). No one wants to hear about it. People will weary of the Uyghurs too. I’ve watched and written about human-rights fashion for a long time now. There is a flavor of the month. Then people lose their taste for it. Remember Darfur? The genocide in the west of Sudan? Terrible crimes still take place in Darfur, but the world has moved on. For years, I tried to interest people in the Uyghurs — people tended to snicker at the name. Now people try to lecture me on the subject. Typical. The issue of human rights is like hemlines. I mean, interest rises and falls. • Okay, let me lighten up — with the gun issue? Yes. Michael Che, on Saturday Night Live, had a funny line (and a serious one too). His co-anchor in the “Weekend Update” sketch, Colin Jost, was talking about gun crimes and gun legislation. Che quipped, “I just bought a gun last summer when all those white kids started talking about getting rid of the police.” • I take my hat off to City Journal, for its current issue: which is a blueprint for the revival of New York City. The world is starving for ideas. Of “dunking” and snarking — “owning” ’em and “drinking their tears” — we have plenty. For ideas — good, honest, and effective ideas — we are starved. So, hurrah for CJ. • The Masters is coming up. And in recent days I have had a memory. In 2008, I attended an event at “Golf House,” a.k.a. the U.S. Golf Association Museum. Arnold Palmer was one of the starry guests — the starriest — and he conducted a little press conference. Someone asked him about Tiger and his future: the record book and so on. Palmer said, essentially, “The sky’s the limit, as long as he stays healthy.” Then he spoke of some of his own injuries, as I recall. I thought, “‘As long as he stays healthy’? Come on, this is golf we’re talking about — not football, or even basketball.” Arnold, of course, was right. • Two years ago, I went to see Charles Hill at Yale. We did a podcast together, which I wrote about here. (The post will lead you to the podcast.) Hill was a great scholar of international relations, a great Foreign Service officer, a great teacher — a “grand strategist.” He has now died at 84. Let me give you another link: to Eric Edelman’s appreciation of him. Edelman, too, is a distinguished U.S. diplomat and scholar. Before going to Yale, I said to Charlie Hill, “Do you want to do a podcast?” “Sure,” he said. “What’s a podcast?” It was such a joy to know and correspond with him a bit. He not only knew the world, he also knew America, and what makes it great. And should our salt ever lose its savour — once and for all — we are cooked. All the diplomatic skill and military might in the world won’t make up for internal rottenness. • Some music? I review a recording — music for piano and orchestra by Chopin (sure), Rimsky-Korsakov (what?), and Korngold (what?) — here. Also, I tell an interesting story in this one, fed to me by a musicologist friend. I relate the story to William Shatner, of Star Trek — you’ll see. • A little language? Critics will say to me, of an article of mine, “You lost me at . . .” This phrase has grown up like a weed. It’s everywhere, taking over the lawn. I’m tempted to reply, “You lost me at ‘You lost me at.’” • I don’t know whether you’ve tried it, but Pepsi has put out a Peeps version, for Easter — you know, Peeps, like the chicks (marshmallow). On one hand, I think this heralds the end-times. On the other, I think: “Yankee ingenuity.” Bless you, my friends, and thanks for joining me. See you soon.

Biden selects diverse raft of judicial nominees,"WASHINGTON — In his four years as president, Donald Trump appointed 226 judges to the federal courts, including three Supreme Court justices. Now President Biden is set to exert his own influence on the composition of the nation’s courts, with 11 nominations to circuit and district courts announced on Tuesday.

“This trailblazing slate of nominees draws from the very best and brightest minds of the American legal profession,” Biden said in a White House statement that also praised the nominees — his first — for their “broad diversity of background, experience, and perspective.”

Among the 11 nominees were three Black women — including one, U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is seen as Biden’s likely first nominee to the Supreme Court, once an opening on that court arises. Her elevation to the influential D.C. circuit court, which was widely expected, will put her within literal and figurative walking distance of the highest court in the land.

(There is, of course, no telling when a Supreme Court vacancy will emerge, but there has been increasing pressure on Justice Stephen Breyer to retire, so that the 82-year-old reliable liberal can be replaced by a younger progressive while Democrats still have a majority in the Senate.)

Progressives cheered the nominations. “We commend President Biden for nominating stellar lawyers to serve on our nation’s federal courts,” said the Alliance for Justice, a group that has advocated for Democrats’ judicial picks. “Today’s nominees embody the demographic and professional diversity and forward-thinking that will ensure justice is served to the American people when they enter a courtroom.”

In its announcement of the nominations, the White House highlighted the fact that one of the nominees, Zahid Quraishi, now a New Jersey magistrate judge, would be “the first Muslim American federal judge in U.S. history.” Quraishi also served in the U.S. military’s judicial corps and was stationed in Iraq.

Story continues

Two of the nominees, Rupa Ranga Puttagunta and Florence Y. Pan, are women of Asian descent. Their nominations come at a time when Asian Americans are facing attacks across the nation, including a killing spree in Atlanta. Elected officials and activists from the Asian American community have asked Biden for greater representation in his administration.

Trump tended to favor white males for judicial nominations, though he did successfully appoint a woman, Amy Coney Barrett, to the U.S. Supreme Court. Another common trait of Trump’s nominees was their youth, meaning they will be on the federal bench for decades to come.

The aggressive pace of judicial nominations during Trump’s four years was set by White House counsel Don McGahn and Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, then the majority leader, as well as Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. The confirmations were seen by conservatives as a signature achievement of the Trump presidency.

Grassley, now the Senate Judiciary Committee’s ranking member, told Yahoo News in a statement that the committee “must evaluate each nominee on his or her merits and qualifications. The committee should give them a hard look to see if they have the experience, the temperament, and the commitment to the Constitution necessary to be a federal judge. We should neither be a rubber stamp, nor should we oppose nominees as a matter of course, as many Democrats did during the Trump administration.”

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a senior Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, welcomed news of the nominations. “I am pleased to see the White House act swiftly to nominate judges to help restore the federal bench after four years of special-interest court-packing,” he said in a statement to Yahoo News. “Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell let big Republican donors stock the federal courts with judges to rule reliably for those big-donor interests. It will take determined effort to expose and undo the damage done by that court-packing machine.”

Leading Biden’s inaugural batch of nominees — her name was first among those announced, a small but telling sign — was Jackson, who currently serves on the D.C. district court. Biden has nominated her to serve on the D.C. circuit court, sometimes regarded as the second-most-important court in the country after the Supreme Court, because many cases of national significance are heard in its courtrooms.

The seat Jackson is expected to occupy, should she be confirmed, was previously held by Merrick Garland, who now serves as U.S. attorney general. Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second Supreme Court pick, also sat on the D.C. circuit court. Biden committed to selecting a Black woman for the Supreme Court, a promise that helped him earn the crucial endorsement of Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., during last year’s contentious Democratic presidential primaries. That endorsement from one of the leading Black legislators on Capitol Hill helped Biden win the South Carolina primary and, in the weeks that followed, to consolidate support from both centrist and left-leaning Democrats.

Barack Obama faced some criticism during his presidency for not pushing more aggressively to have the Senate confirm his judicial nominees. Unable to surmount Republican intransigence, he left office with more than 100 openings for his successor, Trump.

A vacancy on the Supreme Court, which Obama had intended to fill with Garland, was one of those openings. McConnell blocked Garland’s confirmation at the time.

Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 1980s and 1990s, and while it is unclear just how much of a hand he will have in guiding the nominations, it is highly unlikely he will let them languish. The committee does include several Republicans who are expected to seek the 2024 nomination for president, including Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. They could all challenge the nominees in profile-raising ways, much as then-Sen. Kamala Harris did with Kavanaugh and Barrett when she sat on the same committee.

Hearings for the 11 nominees have not yet been scheduled.

MMA fighter who watched George Floyd's death gives emotional testimony at Chauvin trial: 'I witnessed a murder',"The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

How the global demand for seafood is leading Chinese factories to pollute an African nation,"Gunjur, a town of some fifteen thousand people, sits on the Atlantic coastline of southern Gambia, the smallest country on the African continent. During the day, its white-sand beaches are full of activity. Fishermen steer long, vibrantly painted wooden canoes, known as pirogues, toward the shore, where they transfer their still-fluttering catch to women waiting at the water’s edge. The fish are hauled off to nearby open-air markets in rusty metal wheelbarrows or in baskets balanced on heads. Small boys play soccer as tourists watch from lounge chairs. At nightfall, work ends and the beach is dotted with bonfires. There is drumming and kora lessons; men with oiled chests grapple in traditional wrestling matches.

Hike five minutes inland, and you’ll find a more tranquil setting: a wildlife reserve known as Bolong Fenyo. Established by the Gunjur community in 2008, the reserve is meant to protect seven hundred and ninety acres of beach, mangrove swamp, wetland, savannah, and an oblong lagoon. The lagoon, a half mile long and a few hundred yards wide, has been a lush habitat for a remarkable variety of migratory birds as well as humped-back dolphins, epaulet fruit bats, Nile crocodiles, and callithrix monkeys. A marvel of biodiversity, the reserve has been integral to the region’s ecological health—and, with hundreds of birders and other tourists visiting each year, to its economic health, too.

But on the morning of May 22, 2017, the Gunjur community discovered that the Bolong Fenyo lagoon had turned a cloudy crimson overnight, dotted with floating dead fish. “Everything is red,” one local reporter wrote, “and every living thing is dead.” Some residents wondered if the apocalyptic scene was an omen delivered in blood. More likely, ceriodaphnia, or water fleas, had turned the water red in response to sudden changes in pH or oxygen levels. Locals soon reported that many of the birds were no longer nesting near the lagoon.

A few residents filled bottles with water from the lagoon and brought them to the one person in town they thought might be able to help—Ahmed Manjang. Born and raised in Gunjur, Manjang now lives in Saudi Arabia, where he works as a senior microbiologist. He happened to be home visiting his extended family, and he collected his own samples for analysis, sending them to a laboratory in Germany. The results were alarming. The water contained double the amount of arsenic and forty times the amount of phosphates and nitrates deemed safe. The following spring, he wrote a letter to Gambia’s environmental minister, calling the death of the lagoon “an absolute disaster.” Pollution at these levels, Manjang concluded, could only have one source: illegally dumped waste from a Chinese fish-processing plant called Golden Lead, which operates on the edge of the reserve. Gambian environmental authorities fined the company twenty-five thousand dollars, an amount that Manjang described as “paltry and offensive.”

Story continues

Golden Lead is one outpost of an ambitious Chinese economic and geopolitical agenda known as the Belt and Road Initiative, which the Chinese government has said is meant to build goodwill abroad, boost economic cooperation, and provide otherwise inaccessible development opportunities to poorer nations. As part of the initiative, China has become the largest foreign financier of infrastructure development in Africa, cornering the market on most of the continent’s road, pipeline, power plant and port projects. In 2017, China cancelled fourteen million dollars in Gambian debt and invested thirty-three million to develop agriculture and fisheries, including Golden Lead and two other fish-processing plants along the fifty-mile Gambian coast. The residents of Gunjur were told that Golden Lead would bring jobs, a fish market, and a newly paved, three-mile road through the heart of town.

Golden Lead and the other factories were rapidly built to meet an exploding global demand for fishmeal—a lucrative golden powder made by pulverizing and cooking fish. Exported to the United States, Europe, and Asia, fishmeal is used as a protein-rich supplement in the booming industry of fish farming, or aquaculture. West Africa is among the world’s fastest-growing producers of fishmeal: more than fifty processing plants operate along the shores of Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, and Gambia. The volume of fish they consume is enormous: one plant in Gambia alone takes in more than seven thousand five hundred tons of fish a year, mostly of a local type of shad known as bonga—a silvery fish about ten inches long.

For the area’s local fishermen, most of whom toss their nets by hand from pirogues powered by small outboard motors, the rise of aquaculture has transformed their daily working conditions: hundreds of legal and illegal foreign fishing boats, including industrial trawlers and purse seiners, crisscross the waters off the Gambian coast, decimating the region’s fish stocks and jeopardizing local livelihoods.

At the Tanji fish market in summer of 2019, Abdul Sisai stood at a table offering four sickly-looking catfish for sale. The table swarmed with flies, the air was thick with smoke from nearby curing sheds, and menacing seagulls dive-bombed for scraps. Sisai said that bonga had been so plentiful two decades ago that in some markets it had been given away for free. Now it costs more than most local residents can afford. He supplements his income by selling trinkets near the tourist resorts in the evenings.

“Sibijan deben,” Sisai said in Mandinka, one of the major languages in Gambia. Locals use the phrase, which refers to the shade of the tall palm tree, to describe the effects of extractive export industries: the profits are enjoyed by people far from the source—the trunk. In the past several years, the price of bonga has increased exponentially, according to the Association for the Promotion and Empowerment of Marine Fishers, a Senegalese-based research-and-education group. Half the Gambian population lives below the international poverty line—and fish, primarily bonga, accounts for half of the country’s animal-protein needs.

After Golden Lead was fined, in 2019, it stopped releasing its toxic effluent directly into the lagoon. Instead, it ran a long wastewater pipe under a nearby public beach, dumping waste directly into the sea. Swimmers soon started complaining of rashes, the ocean grew thick with seaweed, and thousands of dead fish washed ashore, along with eels, rays, turtles, dolphins, and even whales. Residents burned scented candles and incense to combat the rancid odor coming from the fish meal plants, and tourists wore white masks. The stench of rotten fish clung to clothes, even after repeated washing.

Jojo Huang, the director of the plant, has said publicly that the facility follows all regulations and “does not pump chemicals into the sea.” The plant has benefited the town, she told The Guardian.

In March 2018, about a hundred and fifty local shopkeepers, youth and fishermen, wielding shovels and pickaxes, gathered on the beach to dig up the pipe and destroy it. Two months later, with the government’s approval, workers from Golden Lead installed a new pipe, this time planting a Chinese flag alongside it. The gesture carried colonialist overtones. One local called it “the new imperialism.”

Manjang was outraged. “It makes no sense!” he told me, when I visited him in Gunjur at his family compound, an enclosed three-acre plot with several simple brick houses and a garden of cassava, orange, and avocado trees. Behind Manjang’s thick-rimmed glasses, his gaze is gentle and direct as he speaks urgently about the perils facing Gambia’s environment. “The Chinese are exporting our bonga fish to feed it to their tilapia fish, which they’re shipping back here to Gambia to sell to us, more expensively—but only after it’s been pumped full of hormones and antibiotics.” Adding to the absurdity, he noted, is that tilapia are herbivores that normally eat algae and other sea plants, so they have to be trained to consume fish meal.

Manjang contacted environmentalists and journalists, along with Gambian lawmakers, but was soon warned by the Gambian trade minister that pushing the issue would only jeopardize foreign investment. Dr. Bamba Banja, the head of the Ministry of Fisheries and Water Resources, was dismissive, telling a local reporter that the awful stench was just “the smell of money.”

Global demand for seafood has doubled since the nineteen-sixties. Our appetite for fish has outpaced what we can sustainably catch: more than eighty per cent of the world’s wild fish stocks have collapsed or are unable to withstand more fishing. Aquaculture has emerged as an alternative—a shift, as the industry likes to say, from capture to culture.

The fastest-growing segment of global food production, the aquaculture industry is worth a hundred and sixty billion dollars and accounts for roughly half of the world’s fish consumption. Even as retail seafood sales at restaurants and hotels have plummeted during the pandemic, the dip has been offset in many places by the increase in people cooking fish at home. The United States imports eighty percent of its seafood, most of which is farmed. The bulk of that comes from China, by far the world’s largest producer, where fish are grown in sprawling landlocked pools or in pens offshore spanning several square miles.

Aquaculture has existed in rudimentary forms for centuries, and it does have some clear benefits over catching fish in the wild. It reduces the problem of bycatch—the thousands of tons of unwanted fish that are swept up each year by the gaping nets of industrial fishing boats, only to suffocate and be tossed back into the sea. And farming bivalves—oysters, clams, and mussels—promises a cheaper form of protein than traditional fishing for wild-caught species. In India and other parts of Asia, these farms have become a crucial source of jobs, especially for women. Aquaculture makes it easier for wholesalers to ensure that their supply chains are not indirectly supporting illegal fishing, environmental crimes, or forced labor. There’s potential for environmental benefits, too: with the right protocols, aquaculture uses less fresh water and arable land than most animal agriculture. Farmed seafood produces a quarter of the carbon emissions per pound that beef does, and two-thirds of what pork does.

Still, there are also hidden costs. When millions of fish are crowded together, they generate a lot of waste. If they’re penned in shallow coastal pools, the solid waste turns into a thick slime on the seafloor, smothering all plants and animals. Nitrogen and phosphorus levels spike in surrounding waters, causing algal blooms, killing wild fish, and driving away tourists. Bred to grow faster and bigger, the farmed fish sometimes escape their enclosures and threaten indigenous species.

Even so, it’s clear that if we are to feed the planet’s growing human population, which depends on animal protein, we will need to rely heavily on industrial aquaculture. Leading environmental groups have embraced this idea. In a 2019 report, the Nature Conservancy called for more investment in fish farms, arguing that by 2050 the industry should become our primary source of seafood. Many conservationists say that fish farming can be made even more sustainable with tighter oversight, improved methods for composting waste, and new technologies for recirculating the water in on-land pools. Some have pushed for aquaculture farms to be located farther from shore in deeper waters with faster and more diluting currents.

The biggest challenge to farming fish is feeding them. Food constitutes roughly seventy per cent of the industry’s overhead, and so far the only commercially viable source of feed is fish meal. Perversely, the aquaculture farms that produce some of the most popular seafood, such as carp, salmon, or European sea bass, actually consume more fish than they ship to supermarkets and restaurants. Before it gets to market, a “ranched” tuna can eat more than fifteen times its weight in free-roaming fish that has been converted to fishmeal. About a quarter of all fish caught globally at sea end up as fish meal, produced by factories like those on the Gambian coast. Researchers have identified various potential alternatives—including human sewage, seaweed, cassava waste, soldier-fly larvae, and single-cell proteins produced by viruses and bacteria—but none is being produced affordably at scale. So, for now, fish meal it is.

The result is a troubling paradox: the seafood industry is ostensibly trying to slow the rate of ocean depletion, but by farming the fish we eat most, it is draining the stock of many other fish—the ones that never make it to the aisles of Western supermarkets. Gambia exports much of its fish meal to China and Norway, where it fuels an abundant and inexpensive supply of farmed salmon for European and American consumption. Meanwhile, the fish Gambians themselves rely on for their survival are rapidly disappearing.

In September 2019, Gambian lawmakers gathered in the stately but neglected hall of the National Assembly for an annual meeting, where James Gomez, minister of the country’s fisheries and water resources, insisted that “Gambian fisheries are thriving. ” Industrial fishing boats and plants represent the largest employer of Gambians in the country, including hundreds of deckhands, factory workers, truck drivers, and industry regulators. When a lawmaker asked him about the criticisms of the three fish-meal plants, including their voracious consumption of bonga, Gomez refused to engage. “Boats are not taking more than a sustainable amount,” he said, adding that Gambian waters even have enough fish to sustain two more plants.

Under the best circumstances, estimating the health of a nation’s fish stock is a murky science. Marine researchers like to say that counting fish is like counting trees, except they’re mostly invisible—below the surface—and constantly moving. Ad Corten, a Dutch fishing biologist, told me that the task is even tougher in a place like West Africa, where countries lack the funding to properly analyze their stocks. The only reliable assessments of fish stocks in the area have focussed on Mauritania, Corten said, and they show a sharp decline driven by the fish-meal industry. “Gambia is the worst of them all,” he said, noting that the fisheries ministry barely tracks how many fish are caught by licensed ships, much less the unlicensed ones. As fish stocks have been depleted, many wealthier nations have increased their marine policing, often by stepping up port inspections, imposing steep fines for violations, and using satellites to spot illicit activity at sea. They also have required industrial boats to carry mandatory observers and to install monitoring devices onboard. But Gambia, like many poorer countries, has historically lacked the political will, technical skill, and financial capacity to exert its authority offshore.

Still, though it has no police boats of its own, Gambia is trying to better protect its waters. In August 2019, I joined a secret patrol that the fisheries agency was conducting with the help of an international ocean conservation group called Sea Shepherd, which had brought—as surreptitiously as it could—a one-hundred-and-eighty-four-foot ship called the Sam Simon into the area. It’s equipped with extra fuel capacity, to allow for long patrols, and a doubly reinforced steel hull for ramming into other boats.

In Gambia, the nine miles of water closest to the shore have been reserved for local fishermen, but on any given day dozens of foreign trawlers are visible from the beach. Sea Shepherd’s mission was to find and board trespassers, or other vessels engaged in prohibited behaviors, such as shark finning or netting juvenile fish. In the past few years, the group has worked with African governments in Gabon, Liberia, Tanzania, Benin, and Namibia to conduct similar patrols. Some fisheries experts have criticized these collaborations as publicity stunts, but they have led to the arrest of more than fifty illegal fishing ships.

Barely a dozen local government officials had been informed about the Sea Shepherd mission. To avoid being spotted by fishermen, the group brought in several small speed boats at night and used them to spirit a dozen heavily armed Gambian Navy and fisheries officers out to the Sam Simon. We were joined on the patrol by two gruff private-security contractors from Israel, who were training the Gambian officers in military procedures for boarding ships. While we waited on the moonlit deck, one of the Gambian guards, dressed in a crisp blue-and-white camouflage uniform, showed me a music video on his phone by one of Gambia’s best-known rappers, ST Brikama Boyo. He translated the lyrics of a song, called “Fuwareyaa,” which means “poverty”: “People like us don’t have meat and the Chinese have taken our sea from us in Gunjur and now we don’t have fish.”

Three hours after we embarked, the foreign ships had all but vanished, in what appeared to be a coördinated flight from the forbidden waters. Sensing that word about the operation had gotten out, the Sam Simon’s captain changed plans. Instead of focussing on the smaller unlicensed ships close to land that were mostly from neighboring African countries, he would conduct surprise at-sea inspections of the fifty-five industrial ships that were licensed to be in Gambian waters. It was a bold move: marine officers would be boarding larger, well-financed ships, many of them with political connections in China and Gambia.

Less than an hour later, we pulled alongside the Lu Lao Yuan Yu 010, a hundred-and-thirty-four-foot electric-blue trawler streaked with rust, operated by a Chinese company called Qingdao Tangfeng Ocean Fishery, a company that supplies all three of Gambia’s fish-meal plants. A team of eight Gambian officers from the Sam Simon boarded the ship, AK-47s slung over their shoulders. One officer was so nervous that he forgot the bullhorn he was assigned to carry. Another officer’s sunglasses fell into the sea as he leaped onto the deck.

Onboard the Lu Lao Yuan Yu 010 were seven Chinese officers and a crew of four Gambians and thirty-five Senegalese. The Gambian marine officers soon began grilling the ship’s captain, a short man named Shenzhong Qui who wore a shirt smeared with fish guts. Below deck, ten African crew members in yellow gloves and stained smocks stood shoulder to shoulder on either side of a conveyor belt, sorting bonga, mackerel, and whitefish into pans. Nearby, the floor-to-ceiling rows of freezers were barely cold. Roaches scurried up the walls and across the floor, where some fish had been stepped on and squashed.

I spoke to one of the workers who told me his name was Lamin Jarju and agreed to step away from the line to talk. Though no one could hear us above the deafening ca-thunk, ca-thunk of the conveyor, he lowered his voice before explaining that the ship had been fishing within the nine-mile zone until the captain received a radioed warning from nearby ships that a policing effort was under way.

When I asked Jarju why he was willing to reveal the ship’s violation, he said, “Follow me.” He led me up two levels to the roof of the wheel room, where the captain works. He showed me a large nest of crumpled newspapers, clothing, and blankets, where, he said, several crew members had been sleeping for the past several weeks, ever since the captain hired more workers than the ship could accommodate. “They treat us like dogs,” Jarju said.

When I returned to the deck, an argument was escalating. A Gambian Navy lieutenant named Modou Jallow had discovered that the ship’s fishing log book was blank. All captains are required to maintain log books and keep detailed diaries that document where they go, how long they work, what gear they use, and what they catch. The lieutenant had issued an arrest order for the infraction and was yelling in Chinese at Captain Qui, who was incandescent with rage. “No one keeps that!” he shouted.

He was not wrong. Paperwork violations are common, especially on fishing boats working along the coast of West Africa, where countries don’t always provide clear guidance about their rules. Fishing-boat captains tend to view log books as tools of bribe-seeking bureaucrats or as statistical cudgels of conservationists bent on closing fishing grounds.

But the lack of proper logs makes it almost impossible to determine how quickly Gambia’s waters are being depleted. Scientists rely on biological surveys, scientific modelling and mandatory reports from fish dealers on shore to assess fish stocks. And they use log books to determine fishing locations, depths, dates, gear descriptions, and “fishing effort”—how long nets or lines are in the water relative to the quantity of fish caught.

Jallow ordered the fishing Captain to steer his ship back to port, and the argument moved from the upper deck down to the engine room, where the Captain claimed he needed a few hours to fix a pipe—enough time, the Sam Simon crew suspected, for the Captain to contact his bosses in China and ask them to call in a favor with high-level Gambian officials. Jallow, sensing a stalling tactic, smacked the Captain in the face. “You will make the fix in an hour!” Jallow shouted, grabbing the Captain by the throat. “And I will watch you do it.” Twenty minutes later, the Lu Lao Yuan Yu 010 was en route to shore.

Over the next several weeks, the Sam Simon inspected fourteen foreign ships, most of them Chinese and licensed to fish in Gambian waters, and arrested thirteen of them. Under arrest, ships are typically detained in port for several weeks and fined anywhere from five thousand to fifty thousand dollars. All but one vessel was charged with lacking a proper fishing-log book, and many were also fined for improper living conditions and for violating a law that stipulates Gambians must comprise twenty per cent of shipping crews on industrial vessels in national waters. On one Chinese-owned vessel, there weren’t enough boots for the deckhands, and one Senegalese worker was pricked by a catfish whisker while wearing flip flops. His swollen foot, oozing from the puncture wound, looked like a rotting eggplant. On another ship, eight workers slept in a space meant for two, a four-foot-tall steel-sided compartment directly above the engine room and dangerously hot. When high waves crashed onboard, the water flooded the makeshift cabin, where, the workers said, an electrical power strip had twice almost electrocuted them.

Back in Banjul, one rainy afternoon I sought out Manneh, the local Gambian journalist and environmental advocate. We met in the white-tiled lobby of the Laico Atlantic hotel, decorated with fake potted plants and thick yellow drapes. Pachelbel’s Canon played in an endless loop in the background, accompanied by the plinking of water dripping from the ceiling into half a dozen buckets. Manneh had recently returned to Gambia after a year in Cyprus, where he had fled after his father and brother had been arrested for political activism against Yahya Jammeh, a brutal autocrat who was eventually forced from power in 2017. Manneh, who told me that he hoped to become President one day, offered to take me to the Golden Lead factory.

The next day, Manneh returned in a Toyota Corolla he had hired for the difficult drive. Most of the road from the hotel to Golden Lead was dirt, which recent rains had turned into a treacherous slalom course of deep and almost impassable craters. The trip was about thirty miles, and took nearly two hours. Over the din of a missing muffler, he prepared me for the visit. “Cameras away,” he cautioned. “No saying anything critical about fish meal.” Just a week before my arrival that some of the same fishermen who had pulled up the plant’s wastewater pipe had apparently switched sides, attacking a team of European researchers who had come to photograph the facility, pelting them with rocks and rotten fish. Though they opposed the dumping and resented the export of their fish, some locals did not want foreign media publicizing Gambia’s problems.

We finally pulled up at the entrance of the plant, five hundred yards from the beach, behind a ten-foot wall of white corrugated metal. An acrid stench, like burning orange peels and rotting meat, assaulted us as soon as we got out of the car. Between the factory and the beach was a muddy patch of land, studded with palm trees and strewn with litter, where fishermen were repairing their boats in thatched-roof huts. The day’s catch lay on a set of folding tables, where women were cleaning, smoking, and drying it for sale. One of the women wore a hijab dripping wet from the surf. When I asked her about the catch, she shot me a dour look and tipped her basket toward me. It was barely half-full. “We can’t compete,” she said. Pointing at the factory, she added, “It all goes there.”

The Golden Lead plant consists of several football-field-size concrete buildings, and sixteen silos, where dried fish meal and chemicals were stored. Fish meal is relatively simple to make, and the process is highly mechanized, which means that plants the size of Golden Lead need only about a dozen men on the floor at any given time. Video footage clandestinely taken by a fishmeal worker inside Golden Lead reveals the plant is cavernous, dusty, hot, and dark. Sweating profusely, several men shovel shiny heaps of bonga into a steel funnel. A conveyor belt carries the fish into a vat, where a giant churning screw grinds it into a gooey paste, and then into a long cylindrical oven, where oil is extracted from the goo. The remaining substance is pulverized into a fine powder and dumped onto the floor in the middle of the warehouse, where it accumulates into a ten-foot-tall golden mound. After the powder cools, workers shovel it into fifty-kilogram plastic sacks stacked floor to ceiling. A shipping container holds four hundred bags, and the men fill roughly twenty to forty containers a day.

Near the entrance of Golden Lead, a dozen or so young men hustled from shore to plant with baskets on their heads, brimming with bonga. Nearby, standing under several gangly palm trees, a forty-two-year-old fisherman named Ebrima Jallow explained that the women pay more for a single basket, but Golden Lead buys in bulk and often pays for twenty baskets in advance—in cash. “The women can’t do that,” he said.

A few hundred yards away, Dawda Jack Jabang, the fifty-seven-year-old owner of the Treehouse Lodge, a deserted beachfront hotel and restaurant, stood in a side courtyard staring at the breaking waves. “I spent two good years working on this place,” he told me. “And overnight Golden Lead destroyed my life.” Hotel bookings have plummeted, and the plant’s odor at times is so noxious that patrons leave his restaurant before finishing their meal.

Golden Lead has hurt more than helped the local economy, Jabang said. But what about all of those young men hauling their baskets of fish to the factory? Jabang waved the question away dismissively: “This is not the employment we want. They’re turning us into donkeys and monkeys.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the tenuousness of this employment landscape, as well as its corruption. In May, many of the migrant workers on fishing crews returned home to celebrate Eid just as borders were closing down. With workers unable to return to Gambia and new lockdown measures in place, Golden Lead and other plants suspended operation.

Or they were supposed to. Manneh obtained secret recordings in which Bamba Banja, of the Ministry of Fisheries, discussed bribes in exchange for allowing factories to operate during the lockdown. In October, Banja took a leave of absence after a police investigation found that, between 2018 and 2020, he had accepted ten thousand dollars in bribes from Chinese fisherman and companies, including Golden Lead.

On the day that I visited Golden Lead, I made my way down to the sprawling beach. I found Golden Lead’s new wastewater pipe, which was about 12 inches in diameter, already rusted, corroded and only slightly visible above the mounds of sand. The Chinese flag was gone. Kneeling down, I felt liquid flowing through it. Within minutes, a Gambian guard appeared and ordered me to leave the area.

The next day I headed to the country’s only international airport, located an hour away from the capital, Banjul, to catch my flight home. My luggage was light now that I’d thrown away the putrid-smelling clothes from my trip to the fish-meal plant. At one point during the drive, as we negotiated pothole after pothole, my taxi driver vented his frustration. “This,” he said, gesturing ahead of us, “is the road the fishmeal plant promised to pave.”

At the airport, I discovered my flight had been delayed by a flock of buzzards and gulls blocking the only runway. Several years earlier, the Gambian government had built a landfill close by, and scavenger birds descended in droves. While I waited among a dozen German and Australian tourists, I called Mustapha Manneh. I reached him at home, in the town of Kartong, seven miles from Gunjur..

Manneh told me he was standing in his front yard, looking out on a litter-strewn highway that connects the JXYG factory, a Chinese fish-meal plant, to Gambia’s largest port, in Banjul. In the few minutes we had been talking, he said, he had watched ten tractor-trailer trucks rattle by, kicking up thick clouds of dust as they went, each hauling a forty-foot-long shipping container full of fish meal. From Banjul, those containers would depart for Asia, Europe, and the United States.

“Every day,” Manneh said, “it’s more.”

John James Audubon's 'Carolina Parakeets.' Wikimedia CommonsIt was winter in upstate New York in 1780 in a rural town called Schoharie, home to the deeply religious Palatine Germans. Suddenly, a flock of gregarious red and green birds flew into town, seemingly upon a whirlwind. The townspeople thought the end of the world was upon them. Though the robin-sized birds left quickly, their appearance was forever imprinted on local lore. As author Benjamin Smith Barton wrote, “The more ignorant Dutch settlers were exceedingly alarmed. They imagined, in dreadful consternation, that it portended nothing less calamitous than the destruction of the world.” You and I know that the birds weren’t a precursor of mankind’s demise – but in a way, there was impending doom ahead. These birds were Carolina parakeets, America’s only native parrot. In February 1918, the last captive Carolina parakeet died, alone in a cage in the Cincinnati Zoo, the same zoo where the last captive passenger pigeon, named Martha, died four years earlier. The last “official” wild Carolina parakeet was spotted in Florida just two years later. Why did these birds go extinct? It remains a mystery. Given that parrots today are at greater risk for extinction than other major bird groups, is there anything scientists can learn from the Carolina parakeet? Unraveling parakeet mysteries Over the past six years, I’ve been collecting information about where the Carolina parakeet was observed over the last 450 years. The extinct Carolina parakeet, mounted on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Wikimedia Commons, CC BY I spent hours upon hours reading historical documents, travel diaries and other writings, ranging from the 16th century all the way into the 1940s. I’ve often become lost in the stories surrounding these parrot observations – from the first accounts of Europeans exploring the New World, to the harrowing tales of settlers traveling the Oregon Trail in the 1800s, to grizzled egg hunters scouring the swamps of Florida in the early 1900s. I also dug through natural history museum collections, looking at what many would just see as just some old, dusty, creepy dead birds. But I see them differently: beautiful in their own way, each with a story to tell. My goal was to unravel some of the lasting mysteries about the Carolina parakeet – like where it lived. Historically, people used to determine a species range by plotting the most extreme observations of that species on a map, drawing a polygon around them and called it a day. Because of this, people long thought Carolina parakeets lived from upstate New York all the way to Colorado and down to the Texas coast. But birds are often seen in areas where they don’t normally go. For instance, the range of the snowy owl – like Hedwig of “Harry Potter” fame – doesn’t really extend all the way to Bermuda, though one was once spotted there. The historic distribution of the extinct Carolina parakeet. The green area represents new understanding of where the eastern subspecies lived. The blue is where the western subspecies lived. The red line is based on a range map for the species published in 1891. Ecology and Evolution (2017), CC BY What’s more, scientists don’t know what really drove these parakeets to extinction. Some thought it was habitat loss. Some thought it was hunting and trapping. Some thought disease. A few even thought it was competition with nonnative honey bees for tree cavities, where the parakeets would roost and nest. Thanks to the data I compiled as well as cutting-edge machine learning approaches to analyze those data, my colleagues and I were able to reconstruct the Carolina parakeets’ likely range and climate niche. It turned out to be much smaller than previously believed. Generally, their range extended from Nebraska east to Ohio, south to Louisiana and Texas. The eastern subspecies lived mostly along the southeastern coast from Alabama, through Florida and up to Virginia. We were also able to confirm the longstanding hypothesis that the parakeets in the northwest part of their range migrated southeasterly in the winter, to avoid the blistering cold of the Midwest. Why it matters In a world that faces extinction on a scale not seen in the past 65 million years, some of you may wonder: Aren’t there more important things to study? While this may seem rather minor, some scientists consider the Carolina parakeet one of the top candidates for “de-extinction.” That’s a process in which DNA is harvested from specimens and used to “resurrect” extinct species, not unlike “Jurassic Park” (but way less action and decidedly less Jeff Goldblum). If someone were to spend millions of dollars doing all of the genetic and breeding work to bring back this species, or any other, how will they figure out where to release these birds? Given the effects of climate change, it’s no longer a given that scientists could release birds exactly where they used to be and expect them to flourish. Whether or not de-extinction is a worthwhile use of conservation effort and money is another question, best answered by someone other than me. But this is just an example of one potential use of this type of research. In many ways, the history of the Carolina parakeet’s decline parallels the history of American growth over the course of the 19th century. All that prosperity came with many terrible costs. As the U.S. expanded and remade the landscape to suit its needs, many native species lost out. Today, parrots face a serious threat of extinction. Parrot diversity tends to be highest in areas around the world that are rapidly developing, much like the U.S. during the 19th century. So whatever lessons the Carolina parakeet can teach us may be crucial moving forward. I continue to study Carolina parakeets, and other recently extinct species, in the effort to hear and relate these lessons. As cliche as it is to say, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Seven people have died from blood clots after the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, UK regulators said.

A total of 30 blood clots possibly linked to the vaccine have been reported in the UK.

The UK's drug regulator maintains the benefits of the shots outweigh the risks.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Seven people have died from blood clots after receiving AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Saturday, according to multiple reports.

The agency on Thursday reported 25 new cases of rare blood clots possibly linked to the vaccine, bringing the total number of cases to 30, but did not indicate how many, if any, people had died. MHRA has not received clotting reports following the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine, it said in its Thursday report.

It's still unclear if the AstraZeneca vaccine is causing the blood clots, or if it's just a coincidence.

MHRA maintains the shots are safe. Seven deaths out of more than 18 million AstraZeneca doses delivered by March 24 still means that adverse outcome possibly related to the shot is extremely rare.

""The benefits … in preventing Covid-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so,"" Dr. June Raine, the chief executive of the MHRA, told the BBC.

Many countries have resumed use of AstraZeneca's vaccine

In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine's rollout due to concerns about its possible link to the rare blood clots, Insider's Barnaby Lane reported.

Many resumed or partially resumed its use after the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization emphasized its safety.

""The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in preventing COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalization and death, outweigh the risks of side effects,"" the European Medicines Agency said in a press briefing March 31, echoing what the regulator said in the weeks prior.

Story continues

As Insider's Dr. Catherine Schuster-Bruce previously reported, the EMA said an expert panel including hematologists, neurologists, and epidemiologists could not identify any specific risk factors including age, gender, or previous medical disorder that raised some people's risk of ""these very rare events.""

While there are some theories as to why a vaccine could lead to blood clots, none have been proven in this case, EMA said.

"Earth contains buried chunks of an alien world that are 'millions of times larger than Mount Everest,' research suggests","An artist's depiction of an impact of a protoplanet like Theia and Earth. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Wikimedia Commons

Two gigantic blobs of dense rock hundreds of miles tall sit deep inside Earth.

New research suggests these blobs are remnants of a planet that hit Earth 4.5 billion years ago.

The collision of Earth and this ancient planet, called Theia, may have helped create the moon.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

If you were to peer deep under Earth's crust, you'd spot two giant blobs of rock cupping the planet's core like a pair of hands.

The source of these mysterious continent-sized formations - one under the Pacific Ocean, the other under Africa -has baffled geologists for four decades. Some experts have suggested that the massive rocks are fragments of tectonic plates that got trapped under their counterparts.

But according to new research, their origin may be otherworldly.

A group of scientists from Arizona State University suggested the blobs are remnants of a ""Mars-sized planetary embryo"" named Theia, which struck Earth in its infancy 4.5 billion years ago. The impact is thought to have turned Earth's surface into a sea of fiery magma and caused it to shoot out enough planetary debris to create the moon.

Qian Yuan, the lead researcher behind the findings, studies geodynamics at ASU. He thinks that following the ancient collision, parts of Theia may have sunk and gotten preserved deep in our planet's mantle - the semisolid layer between Earth's crust and core, he said.

Those pieces are ""millions of times larger than Mount Everest in terms of volume,"" Yuan told Insider.

Dense areas up to 621 miles in height

Geologists discovered these chunks - their technical name is large low-shear-velocity provinces - by sending seismic waves down into the planet. Under both Africa and the Pacific Ocean, the speed of these seismic waves slowed to a crawl, suggesting an area of rock denser than its surroundings. The animation below, based on a 2016 analysis, shows the size of these areas.

According to Yuan, these blobs are between 1.5 and 3.5% more dense than the rest of Earth's mantle, and hotter.

Story continues

If the planet Theia was rich in iron and highly dense, Yuan's models showed, any pieces of it that broke off when it hit Earth would have sunk deep into our planet's mantle. There, they could have accumulated undisturbed, rather than getting mixed into the rest of the mantle.

It's also possible denser chunks of Earth's crust sank into the mantle and joined them, contributing to the blobs' growth over time, Yuan said.

Figuring out what these slabs are made of is challenging. Their deepest parts are 1,800 miles under our feet, in the part of the mantle closest to Earth's outer core. They're 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) high and two to three times wider than they are tall.

But scientists have figured out that plumes of hot rock and magma from some Icelandic and Samoan volcanoes came from these blobs. By analyzing this magma's makeup, researchers can glean insight into the composition of these mysterious buried chunks. According to a 2019 study, some elements in the volcanic plumes date back to about 4.5 billion years ago - when Theia supposedly hit Earth.

When planets collide

The idea that the impact between a tiny planet and Earth helped form the moon has been around for more than 45 years. But a problem with that hypothesis is that scientists haven't found any evidence of Theia's existence.

A 2016 study suggested that's because Earth's and Theia's cores fused together. Another idea, put forward in 2018, posits that when the planets collided, both were ""almost completely vaporized,"" Yuan said. According to that thinking, Earth became a rapidly spinning mass of molten and vaporized rock called a synestia, then collapsed back into a molten planet. Part of that spinning mass became the moon, and Theia was no more.

A third theory - called the ""hit-and-run,"" according to Yuan - is that Theia just glanced off Earth, and chunks of one planet, or pieces from both, combined to form the moon. But the moon's composition matches Earth's almost exactly, which suggests it contains very little of Theia.

Yuan's new findings, which will soon be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, may finally offer proof that Theia was in our solar system billions of years ago.

What you can and can't do once vaccinated that the CDC guidelines don't tell you,"Elderly-care workers celebrate getting vaccines in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 24, 2020. Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images

The CDC's guidelines for vaccinated people don't cover every scenario, including some common ones.

There isn't advice for people who've had one dose or for families with members that aren't immunized.

Experts weigh in on what's safe in 6 common scenarios not mentioned in the CDC recommendations.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

With a growing number of states rolling out vaccines to the general public, most US adults could get their hands on a shot by summer, if not sooner. So far, 30% of the US population has received a first dose.

But until a majority of the country has been vaccinated, it's tough even for vaccinated people to determine what's safe. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers basic guidelines for vaccinated Americans, quite a few common scenarios aren't addressed in the agency's recommendations.

For instance, the CDC doesn't offer advice for households in which only some family members are vaccinated, or for people who've received just one vaccine dose. The guidance also stops short of telling vaccinated people whether they can return to indoor activities, and there's no concrete rule about exactly how many fully vaccinated people can gather indoors without masks.

So we asked physicians to weigh in on a handful of these common yet confusing scenarios. In general, they said, vaccinated people can incur more risk if they live alone or with others who've gotten their shots.

Wait to get both shots before changing your behavior

The CDC doesn't consider a person to be fully vaccinated until at least two weeks after their second dose of Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine, or two weeks after their single shot of Johnson & Johnson's. That's because it takes time for immunity to build.

Dr. Vivek Cherian, an internal-medicine physician in Baltimore, told Insider that it's not worth the risk to start changing your behavior in between your first and second shot.

""You'd be really only talking about waiting an extra few weeks to get your second dose and reap those benefits,"" he said.

Steer clear of large gatherings if you live with unvaccinated people

The CDC says it's alright for vaccinated people to remove their masks when visiting other fully vaccinated people indoors or seeing unvaccinated people from a single household.

""The guidance is fairly straightforward,"" Dr. Jonathan Leizman, a family medicine physician and the chief medical officer at Premise Health, told Insider. ""What is not always straightforward, though, are real-life circumstances. Split households, where some members are vaccinated and others are not, is one example.""

Physicians generally advise that these households stick to outdoor activities and steer clear of large gatherings until all members have gotten their shots.

For example, Cherian said, in his family, he's vaccinated but his wife and children aren't. So they've chosen to refrain from activities with crowds - such as birthday parties - even if they're outdoors.

""Given that our older son is attending a school that is practicing safety against COVID-19 by maintaining learning pods, we feel an even greater ethical responsibility to reduce risk as much as possible,"" he said.

Households with high-risk individuals should be extra cautious

Leizman said it's important to consider whether unvaccinated people in your household are vulnerable to severe COVID-19. If that's the case, even the vaccinated person should continue to wear masks in public and ensure any gatherings with people outside the home are social distanced and outdoors.

""In instances where one member of a couple is unvaccinated and does not have risk factors for severe COVID-19, [the couple] may socialize indoors and without a mask with another adult who is fully vaccinated,"" Leizman said.

The CDC recommends that vaccinated people continue to avoid medium and large in-person gatherings - but the agency doesn't give a specific cutoff for the number of attendees. Experts don't yet seem to agree about whether multiple households of fully vaccinated people should gather in groups.

""The time for concerts, weddings, and other large-scale events will certainly come, and the risk of creating a superspreader event is certainly lower if participants are vaccinated,"" Leizman said. But he added that ""vaccination is truly only one part of the public health puzzle.""

For now, he suggested that ""fully vaccinated people should avoid these types of gatherings.""

But Cherian said the size of the event isn't the main issue - it's whether any unvaccinated people are in attendance.

""If all individuals are fully vaccinated, there is an extremely low risk to those present,"" he said. ""When you start having larger gatherings and include unvaccinated individuals from many different households, the risk of COVID-19 transmission increases.""

It's fine to take the subway, but wear your mask

The CDC updated its guidelines on Friday to allow vaccinated people to travel domestically on planes, trains, or buses. But it doesn't offer specific recommendations for Americans' daily commutes.

Subways, trains, and buses tend to hold large crowds, so riders face a higher risk of COVID-19 exposure.

Leizman said that vaccinated people can consider taking the subway if they wear masks and practice social distancing whenever possible.

Be selective about high-risk activities like indoor dining or church services

Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician in Baltimore, told CNN that she considers the CDC guidelines for vaccinated people to be ""overly cautious"" about indoor activities.

""Let's say that someone is vaccinated and really wants to attend in-person church services and to go back to their senior center for indoor activities,"" she said. ""The risk to them is very low, and their risk to others is also low.""

The same goes for indoor dining, Wen added: ""I'd go so far as to say that a couple that really wants to eat out in a restaurant again could do so occasionally, but not night after night.""

In general, experts recommended that vaccinated people choose the indoor activities that matter most to them, then engage in these activities sparingly until most others are vaccinated as well.

Then and now: Rising temperatures threaten corals,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at coral bleaching, and how warming waters are threatening the survival of a true wonder of the seas.

Coral reefs are hives of activity in the ocean, where many different species can be found. Scientists refer to such zones as biodiversity hotspots.

Although reefs take up less than 1% of the area covered by ocean, they are estimated to be home to more than a third of life under the waves.

Click here to see the BBC interactive

Yet they too face an uncertain future as a result of a warming world. Scientists list climate change as the main cause of damage to the world's reefs.

Corals can't tolerate very high temperatures, so as ocean water warms, they effectively become ""sick"". Thermal stress of this kind can lead to the coral becoming bleached, meaning they lose their striking colours and turn white or very pale.

Coral can survive bleaching events, but in this state they are also more likely to die.

The before and after photos show an episode of bleaching and coral mortality in American Samoa, a territory in the Pacific Ocean, back in 2015.

A US team of scientists observed at the time: ""Severe bleaching and mortality occurred on shallow inshore and [lagoon] reefs along southern Tutuila [American Samoa's main island].

""These shallow habitats have limited water circulation, which worsens the effects of high temperature stress.""

Despite this worrying event, the state of the reefs in this area are currently deemed to be ""good"".

Map

Delicate partnership

Coral is an umbrella term for several species of marine invertebrates (animals without backbones). They have a hard outer layer (exoskeleton) made from calcium carbonate - the same stuff shells are made out of.

Story continues

They are found all over the globe, from tropical waters to the freezing polar regions. However, corals only form reefs in the warm, shallow seas of the tropics. The most famous of these is the 2,300km-long Great Barrier Reef, located off the north-eastern shores of Australia.

Healthy coral forms a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae. In return for being allowed to live in the corals' hard, calcium carbonate exoskeleton, the algae help produce food for their hosts. Zooxanthellae also provide the vibrant colours we associate with healthy coral reefs.

However, as waters warm, and the delicate marine ecosystem becomes sick, or stressed, the mutually beneficial relationship breaks down.

The algae ""jump ship"", leaving the coral without its main food source. The result is that the coral turns white or very pale and becomes more vulnerable to pathogens.

Coral bleaching is thus a visible and dramatic signal of a reef under severe pressure.

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) says that the temperature increase in the oceans as a result of climate change is the main cause of bleaching.

According to London's Natural History Museum, coral reefs have an estimated global value of £6tn each year.

Fish and other marine animals lose their habitats when coral die off

This is partially a result of their contribution to the fishing and tourism industries.

In addition, the ridges in reefs act as barriers and can reduce wave energy by up to 97%, providing coastal areas with crucial protection against threats such as tsunamis.

They help protect areas such as mangrove forests and seagrass beds that act as nurseries for marine animals, as well as human coastal populations.

Barrier reef under threat

In 2019, an Australian government report downgraded the outlook of The Great Barrier Reef from ""poor"" to ""very poor"" as a result of climate change.

It said rising sea temperatures - thanks to greenhouse gas emissions from human activity - remained the biggest threat to the reef.

The reef was designated a World Heritage site in 1981 for its ""enormous scientific and intrinsic importance"", but in recent years it has been increasingly damaged by warmer seas, which have killed off coral and affected its long-term health.

The Great Barrier Reef's condition is deteriorating as a result of climate change. say scientific studies

Noaa researchers say that, if the bleaching is not severe, it is possible for the coral to recover.

However, scientists are concerned that we are pushing the delicate marine ecosystems beyond their ability to cope. This means that natural wonders sometimes described as the ""rainforests of the seas"" could be reaching their breaking point.

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch.

"Can Vaccinated People Spread the Virus? We Don't Know, Scientists Say.","The New York Times

CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — The children tumbled out of a white van, dazed and tired, rubbing sleep from their eyes. They had been on their way north, traveling without their parents, hoping to cross the border into the United States. They never made it. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Detained by Mexican immigration officers, they were brought to a shelter for unaccompanied minors in Ciudad Juárez, marched in single file and lined up against a wall for processing. For them, this facility about 1 mile from the border is the closest they will get to the United States. “‘Mommy, I have bad news for you,’” one of the girls at the shelter, Elizabeth, 13, from Honduras, recalled telling her mother on the phone. “‘Don’t cry, but Mexican immigration caught me.’” The children are part of a growing wave of migrants hoping to find a way into the United States. If they make it across the border, they can try to present their case to U.S. authorities, go to school and one day find work and help relatives back home. Some can reunite with parents waiting there. But for those caught before crossing the border, the long road north ends in Mexico. If they are from elsewhere in the country, as a growing number are because of the economic toll of the pandemic, they can be picked up by a relative and taken home. But most of them are from Central America, propelled north by a life made unsustainable by poverty, violence, natural disasters and the pandemic, and encouraged by the Biden administration’s promise to take a more generous approach to immigration. They will wait in shelters in Mexico, often for months, for arrangements to be made. Then, they will be deported. The journey north is not an easy one and the children who brave it have to grow up fast. At the shelter, most of them are teenagers, but some are as young as 5. Traveling alone, without parents — in groups of children, or with a relative or a family friend — they may run into criminal networks that often take advantage of migrants, and into border officers determined to stop them. But they keep trying, by the thousands. “There is a big flow, for economic reasons, and it will not stop until people’s lives in these countries improve,” said José Alfredo Villa, director of the Nohemí Álvarez Quillay shelter for unaccompanied minors in Ciudad Juárez. In 2018, 1,318 children were admitted into shelters for unaccompanied minors in Ciudad Juárez, local authorities said. By 2019, the number of admissions had grown to 1,510 children, though it dipped to 928 last year because of the pandemic. But in the first 2 1/2 months of this year, the number has soared to 572 — a rate that, if kept up for the rest of the year, would far surpass 2019, the highest year on record. When children enter the shelter, their schooling stops, the staff unable to provide classes for so many children coming from different countries and different educational backgrounds. Instead, the children fill their days with art classes, where they often draw or paint photos of their home countries. They watch television, play in the courtyard or complete chores to help the shelter run, like laundry. The scene in Ciudad Juárez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas, tells only one part of a larger story that is playing out all along the border’s nearly 2,000 miles. Elizabeth, the 13-year-old from Villanueva, Honduras, said that when Mexican authorities detained her in early March, she thought of her mother in Maryland and how disappointed she would be. When she called from the shelter, her mother was ecstatic at first, thinking she had crossed, Elizabeth said; then, on hearing the news, her mother burst into tears. “I told her not to cry,” Elizabeth said. “We would see each other again.” The New York Times agreed to use the middle names of all unaccompanied minors interviewed to protect their identities. Their family circumstances and the outlines of their cases were confirmed by caseworkers at the shelter who are in touch with their relatives and with authorities in their countries to arrange for their deportation. If Elizabeth had made it across the river into Texas, her life would be different now. Even if apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, she would have been released to her mother and given a court date to present her asylum case. The success of her asylum application would not be a given. In 2019, 71% of all cases involving unaccompanied minors resulted in deportation orders. But many never turn up for their hearings; they dodge authorities and slip into the population, to live lives of evasion. For the majority of children in the shelter, being caught in Mexico means only one thing: deportation to their home country in Central America. About 460 children were deported from shelters in Juárez in the first three months of the year, according to Villa, the shelter director. And they often wait for months as Mexican officials routinely struggle to gain the cooperation of Central American countries to coordinate deportations, he said. Elizabeth has no idea who will take care of her if she is sent back to Honduras. Her father walked out on the family when she was born, she said, and the grandmother she lived with is dying. When Elizabeth’s mother left in 2017, it broke her, she said. The mother had taken out loans to support Elizabeth. When loan sharks came after the family seeking repayment, she went to the United States to look for work, Elizabeth said. “When my mother left, I felt my heart left, my soul,” she said, crying. Elizabeth’s mother landed a good job in landscaping in Maryland and wanted to spare her daughter the treacherous journey to the United States. But when the grandmother’s health left her unable to care for Elizabeth, it was the girl’s turn to say goodbye. Elizabeth said she doubted whether she would ever see her grandmother again. In early March, Elizabeth made it to the Rio Grande, on Mexico’s northern border. She began wading toward Texas when local authorities caught her and pulled her out of the water. Mexican immigration officials dropped her off at the Nohemí Álvarez Quillay shelter, which is named after an Ecuadorean girl who died by suicide at another shelter in Juárez in 2014 after being detained. She was 12, and on her way to reunite with parents who had lived in New York City since she was a toddler. In mid-March, two weeks after her arrival, Elizabeth celebrated her 13th birthday at the shelter. As shelter staff cut the cake for Elizabeth — the children are prohibited from handling sharp objects — three more children were dropped off by immigration authorities, just hours after the eight who had arrived that morning. They watched cartoons as they waited for shelter officials to register them. Elizabeth’s best friend since she arrived, Yuliana, 15, was by her side, apprehended by Mexican authorities in December when she tried to cross the border carrying her 2-year-old cousin and tugging on the hand of her 4-year-old cousin. Yuliana is from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, one of the most violence-wracked cities in the world. Both girls said they had seen a parent struggle to put food on the table before making the tough decision to migrate to the United States. And both felt that their failure to cross had upturned the tremendous expectations that had been placed on them: to reunite with a lonely parent, to work and to send money to family members left behind. For the girls, home is not a place — Honduras or the United States. Home is where their families are. That is where they want to be. “My dream is to get ahead and raise my family,” Yuliana said. “It is the first thing, to help my mother and my brothers. My family.” The day she left San Pedro Sula to join her father in Florida, she said, her mother made her promise one thing. “She asked me never to forget her,” Yuliana said. “And I answered that I could never, because I was leaving for her.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",

So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

India pushes back deadline for coal-fired utilities to adopt new emission norms,"(Corrects to add 'back' in headline)

By Sudarshan Varadhan

CHENNAI (Reuters) - India has pushed back deadlines for coal-fired power plants to adopt new emission norms by up to three years, and allowed utilities that miss the new target to continue operating after paying a penalty, according to a government notice.

India had initially set a 2017 deadline for thermal power plants to install Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) units that cut emissions of sulphur dioxides. But that was postponed to varying deadlines for different regions, ending in 2022.

The new order dated April 1 from the environment ministry says plants near populous regions and the capital New Delhi will have to comply by 2022, while utilities in less polluting areas have up to 2025 to comply or retire units.

Operators of coal-fired utilities including state-run NTPC Ltd and industry groups representing private companies such as Reliance Power and Adani Power have long been lobbying for dilution of the pollution standards, citing high compliance costs.

The latest notice follows suggestions from the power ministry that plants be given deadlines to adopt norms in line with the severity of pollution in the region where they are located.

A task force will be constituted by the Central Pollution Control Board to categorise plants in three categories ""on the basis of their location to comply with the emission norms"", the environment ministry said in its order.

In case of non-compliance, a penalty of up to 0.20 rupees ($0.0027) will be levied for every unit of electricity produced.

The power ministry said in January that a ""graded action plan"" could help avoid immediate increase in power prices in various relatively clean areas of India and avoid unnecessary burden on power utilities and consumers.

Indian cities have some of the world's most polluted air.

Thermal power companies, which produce three-fourths of the country's electricity, account for some 80% of its industrial emissions of particulate matter, sulphur- and nitrous-oxides, which cause lung diseases, acid rain and smog.

One of the companies producing the J&J vaccine has a history of quality control violations, AP reported.

Emergent Biosolutions was cited by the FDA on quality control issues, including mold and cracked vials.

The company is at the center of the mix-up that led to 15 million discarded doses of the vaccine on Wednesday.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The company at the center of the mix-up that led to roughly 15 million discarded doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has a history of quality control violations, the Associated Press reported.

A manufacturing plant in Baltimore under Emergent Biosolutions, one of eight companies producing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, spoiled a batch of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, delaying production and halting future shipments, The New York Times reported Wednesday.

The mishap was due to human error, according to The Times, when workers at the plant mixed up the vaccine ingredients. The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating the incident.

But the company has been cited on multiple occasions by the Food and Drug Administration for quality control issues, ranging from cracked vials and poorly trained employees to problems managing mold and other contaminants within one of its facilities, according to records obtained by AP through the Freedom of Information Act.

When Johnson & Johnson first went to Emergent in April of last year to produce their vaccine, Emergent's Bayview facility was described as a contract testing laboratory that ""did not manufacture products for distribution,"" according to FDA records obtained by the AP. At the time, it also didn't have the capacity for making millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

In a recent inspection, the FDA cited the company's Bayview plant on ""data integrity concerns"" after a review found that the facility had failed to ensure that electronic testing data ""was protected from deletion or manipulation,"" the AP reported.

The Bayview plant was criticized for not following proper testing and lab procedures, according to the report. The FDA also cited the facility for not having a proper method for discarding rejected materials after an inspector wrote that ""separate or defined areas to prevent contamination or mix-ups are deficient"" at the plant.

In December 2017, another Emergent plant in Canton, Massachusetts, was also cited for not correcting ""continued low level mold and yeast isolates"" found in the facility.

A 2018 inspection of the company's Baltimore facility found that ""procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile are not adequately established and followed,"" according to the AP report.

A spokesman for the FDA told the AP that the agency ""cannot comment on any particular company or any potential or ongoing compliance matters.""

Representatives from Emergent did not immediately return Insider's request for comment regarding the report, but Emergent spokesman Matt Hartwig told AP in a statement that the company's ""rigorous quality checks"" found the spoiled batch that did not meet its standards.

""Discarding a batch of bulk drug substance, while disappointing, does occasionally happen during vaccine manufacturing, which is a complex and multi-step biological process,"" he wrote in the email to AP.

Despite the factory mixup, the Biden administration still expects to reach its goal of having enough vaccines to make every American adult eligible for a vaccine by the end of May, The Times reported.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that none of the already available doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines were impacted by the factory mixup, and that the company still expects to deliver 24 million doses in April and 100 million doses by the end of May.

""Obviously, these are doses that the U.S. government has purchased, but we also have plenty of doses from Pfizer and Moderna regardless,"" Psaki said.

In an interview on ""CBS This Morning,"" top US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci responded to the incident, saying that ""human errors do happen.""

""The good news about this, despite the fact that it's really quite unfortunate that about 15 million doses are not going to be able to be used, you do have checks and balances, and you see that,"" Fauci said, ""and that's the reason why the good news is that it did get picked up.

""That's the reason that nothing from that plant has gone into anyone that we've administered to,"" Fauci continued.

In a chaotic situation at the southern border, agents are escorting migrants and expelling them from the US before they know what’s happening Joel Duarte Mendez, 25, and his son, Hector, traveled from Honduras to the US over 12 days to city of Reynosa, Texas. They were flown from the Rio Grande Valley to El Paso and later bussed and deported into Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Photograph: Jorge Salgado/The Guardian They couldn’t work out quite where they were or where they were headed when the guards told them: “Keep going”. They walked forward, as instructed, across an unfamiliar bridge and then suddenly they were in Mexico. Or, more accurately, back in Mexico. But 800 miles from where they had arrived in America. In a chaotic situation at the southern border, US Customs and Border Protection agents are escorting migrants across the bridge that links downtown El Paso, Texas, with the adjacent city in Mexico, Ciudad Juárez, and expelling them from the US before they even know what’s happening. One young mother just sat directly down on the sidewalk on the Mexican side of the international bridge linking the two cities and clutched her breastfeeding child to her as they huddled in cold, late March weather. The child, no more than 18 months old, wearing a pink sweater and wrapped in a blanket first fed, then slept in her arms, unaware of the moments her bewildered mother would let a tear roll down her face. At one point the woman covered the little girl’s hands with socks to stop her from crying due to the cold wind, despite the fact that the mother didn’t have a jacket of her own. A group of migrants rapidly deported from the US under Trump’s Title 42 wait on the Mexican side of the Paso del Norte international bridge, between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico on 10 March 2021. Photograph: Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images The sight is all too familiar in Juárez where dozens of migrants are being unceremoniously ejected from the US daily via a health protocol put in place by the Trump administration, known as Title 42, where migrants can be expelled to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the US. Some undocumented people who cross the US-Mexico border are being admitted to the US to begin the asylum process, mainly unaccompanied minors and – theoretically – parents with very young children. But most adult migrants and families currently being apprehended in the US are being expelled, though often not before being taken on a confusing and winding journey by the authorities on the American side. “I came through Reynosa, I went to the wall and immigration picked us up,” 25-year-old Joel Duarte Mendez, who had originally traveled from Honduras, explained. Reynosa is at the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border, 754 miles from the cities of Juárez and El Paso at the extreme western end. After crossing from Reynosa into Texas, Mendez and his two-year-old son, Hector, were briefly detained. “Then they had us on a plane, then from there they put us on a bus and they just threw us here,” he said, pointing at the international bridge linking El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. I said, ‘this is my opportunity to go’ and, well, that just simply wasn’t the case American border agents had lined up the group of people after they got off the bus, took them part way across the bridge and then “they told us to ‘keep going’,” Mendez said. He clung to Hector, the boy wrapped in a jacket obviously fit for his father, who was braving the cold weather in a T-shirt. “I came with my son to give him a better life,” Mendez said. Their trip from Honduras to the border took 12 days, he said. He owned a coffee farm and a home in Honduras, but both had been destroyed when massive hurricanes hit the country last November. With the climate crisis believed to be causing stronger hurricanes, Mendez and Hector have effectively become climate refugees. He used what was left of his money to pay for the trip, he said. “We thought they were letting people with children five years and younger enter [the US], so I said, ‘this is my opportunity to go’ and, well, that just simply wasn’t the case,” he told the Guardian, dejectedly. Families wait inside a processing center in Ciudad Juárez as they are interviewed near the Paso del Norte international bridge. Photograph: Jorge Salgado/The Guardian Title 42 was the last big piece of Donald Trump’s anti-immigration agenda that all but closed the US-Mexico border to the undocumented in the pandemic. Joe Biden’s administration has rescinded Trump’s so-called Remain in Mexico policy, where migrants were forced to wait in often-dangerous border towns in Mexico while their claims for asylum from violent countries were processed in the US, sometimes taking years. But for those without legal cases already underway in the US, Biden is continuing to use Title 42 while the pandemic lingers. Many crossing the border now are not even being officially processed into a border patrol or a Department of Health and Human Services facility, nor being turned over to family in the states to await a date with immigration court. They are just expelled into Mexico. Mendez and the breastfeeding mother were among a group of approximately three-dozen migrants, almost all of them parents with young children, whom the Guardian saw being ousted from the US in recent days. In Juárez, they were escorted into a gated area right off the bridge by the Mexican authorities, where journalists were not allowed to interview them. But tears were visible, and many looked confused. The last mother in line had a young boy in her arms and another small child walking in front of her, both children were crying, while tears began streaming down the woman’s face when she realized she was in Mexico. The group spent more than an hour in the gated area, before it was opened and several families spilled onto the streets of Juárez, left to fend for themselves. Those who had contacts in the area asked for directions to taxis or called someone to pick them up, but others just sat on the street, unsure of their next move. One father, who was not prepared to share his name, explained that since crossing briefly into the US they had never been told where they were or where they were going. “We were there in the detention center waiting supposedly for them to contact a family member of ours [in the US] so they could come get us or send for us, but no, they lied to us,” he said. The other father said: “It’s completely false that they would let us enter with small children.” Four children sit on the streets of Ciudad Juárez after being deported from the US. Photograph: Jorge Salgado/The Guardian There are conflicting reports about why migrants are being transported from one end of the Texas border to the other, ranging from accounts about emergency shelters being full on either side of the border, especially because of Covid-19 restrictions that have closed many or shrunk capacity, to cruel tactics simply to deter migrants with an extra dose of desperation. Nearby, another family: three children huddled around their mother, the father pacing back and forth. He confirmed that they had received no information from the agents who expelled them. “Imagine what we go through from Honduras to get here: walking, hitchhiking, feeling hungry, suffering with our children,” he said. “They took our photos, our fingerprints, kept us for three days, and then sent us here without signing anything.” Mendez said he thought things would be different under the Biden administration. He has a brother in Charlotte, North Carolina, who had been expecting to pick him and Hector up, when Mendez called him with the bad news. “He reprimanded me for making the journey,” Mendez said. “I told him I had no other choice, I didn’t want us to starve.” Now, he was stranded in Juárez, thousands of miles from home, with no money to return.

"Biden aims to juice EV sales, but would his plan work?","DETROIT (AP) — Dangling tax credits and rebates in his drive to fight climate change, President Joe Biden wants you to trade your gas-burning car, truck or SUV for a zero-emissions electric vehicle.

Some buyers would find his offer persuasive. Yet Biden's goal is a daunting one: Even if Congress approves his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, along with its incentives, it would take many years to replace enough internal combustion vehicles with EVs to make a huge dent in tailpipe emissions.

Right now, there are about 279 million vehicles on the road in the United States. The proportion that are fully electric, according to IHS Markit, is 0.36%. Of the 14.5 million new vehicles that were sold last year, 2% were fully electric.

Even if every new vehicle sold were battery powered — something no one envisions — it would take about 15 years to swap out the entire fleet. What's more, cars built during the past two decades last far longer than previous vehicles, so buyers are keeping them longer. The average U.S. vehicle has been on the road for nearly 12 years.

Research shows that each EV sold does cut emissions. But it could take a couple of years for an EV to reach that point if coal is used to generate power to recharge the vehicle, said Bruce Belzowski, a retired University of Michigan transportation researcher who runs a company that studies the auto industry's future.

“If you don't start somewhere, you're never going to get anywhere,” Belzowski said. “Every electric vehicle that you sell is going to be net positive for the environment.”

The Biden administration didn't offer specifics on just how much car buyers would receive to trade in their vehicles. But it plans to spend $174 billion over eight years on EVs. That figure includes incentives for consumers, grants to build 500,000 charging stations, and money to develop U.S. supply chains for parts and minerals needed to make batteries.

“We're going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale rebates to all American families,” Biden said Wednesday.

Story continues

The biggest incentive likely will be expansion of the electric vehicle tax credit, now $7,500, which is phased out after an automaker sells 200,000 battery-electric vehicles. Tesla and General Motors have exceeded the cap. Nissan is getting close.

A summary of Biden's plan didn't have any numbers. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, though, are backing a bill that would raise the cap to 600,000. The bill also includes a tax credit of at least $1,250 for those who buy used EVs.

Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, an industry consulting firm, said that either the administration doesn't yet have specific numbers or deliberately omitted them while negotiations take place among the auto industry, Congress and environmental groups.

“They know there's going to be some level of compromise needed,” he said.

The form and size of the rebates also were not detailed. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has proposed large discounts to those who buy American-made EVs — a possible reprise of the 2009 “Cash for Clunkers” program that offered $4,500 rebates for people to trade in less-efficient vehicles.

The rebates and charging stations address two key reasons why many consumers are wary about switching to electric vehicles, Schuster said. Combined, he predicts that the incentives would help elevate EV sales from about 358,000 this year to over 1 million by 2023 and up to 4 million by 2030.

If Biden's plan succeeds and EV sales take off, shortages of computer chips, metals used to build batteries, and a lack of battery factory capacity could leave the industry falling behind buyer demand, at least for a couple of years, Schuster said.

David Kirsch, a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, said the Biden plan isn't really a tipping point that will turn consumers from combustion to electric vehicles.

“There will be some good changes that will happen because of the scale of this investment, and those should not be minimized,"" Kirsch said. “I think electrification was coming anyway.”

Indeed, the industry already was spending billions to develop EVs. LMC Automotive said 22 new electric models are coming out this year. A 2018 study by Alix Partners found that the global auto industry would spend $255 billion on EVs by 2023.

At the same time, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota and most major automakers, wrote in a letter to Biden that despite battery costs declining, EVs still are more expensive than combustion vehicles. The group, joined by the United Auto Workers union and a parts supply association, is urging the government to help address the difference. It is seeking tax credits, research spending and requirements to replace the federal fleet with electric vehicles.

Even with such added spending, people in general will likely drive less in the future, because in the aftermath of the pandemic, many companies will allow a combination of work from home and office work. That will make some people even more reluctant to replace their vehicles, Schuster said.

Yet Kirsch says that no matter how effective Biden's plan is or isn't in fighting climate change, the spending on modernizing the transportation fleet and infrastructure is long overdue.

“What we're doing is playing catch-up on some long-delayed investment,” he said.",

There’s nothing unusual about exaggeration in politics. But when it comes to the debate over voting rights, something more than exaggeration is going on. There’s a real — and bipartisan — misunderstanding about whether making it easier or harder to vote, especially by mail, has a significant effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. The evidence suggests it does not. The fight over the new Georgia election law is only the latest example. That law, passed last week, has been condemned by Democrats as voter suppression, or even as tantamount to Jim Crow. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Democrats are understandably concerned about a provision that empowers the Republican-controlled state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. That provision has uncertain but potentially substantial effects, depending on what the Legislature might do in the future. And it’s possible the law is intended to do exactly what progressives fear: reshape the electorate to the advantage of Republicans, soon after an electoral defeat, by making it harder to vote. And yet the law’s voting provisions are unlikely to significantly affect turnout or Democratic chances. It could plausibly even increase turnout. In the final account, it will probably be hard to say whether it had any effect on turnout at all. The Georgia law The Georgia can be boiled down to a few points: — The law makes absentee voting harder. People must have a qualifying form of identification to vote by mail. The law also makes it harder to request and return an absentee ballot, restricting the period when people can apply for one and limiting the number of drop boxes where voters can return such a ballot in person. — On balance, it might make in-person voting easier, especially in the general election (though it contains provisions that cut in both directions). The law expands the number of required days of early voting, including on the weekend days that progressives covet (two Saturdays are now required instead of one). There’s also a provision that requires large precincts with long lines to add machines, add staff or split the precinct. Depending on how this is rolled out, it could be a big win for voters in Georgia’s urban areas, who have dealt with some of the longest lines in the country. Cutting in the other direction is the gratuitous and probably ineffectual limitation on handing out food and water to people standing in line to vote. Of more concrete but still limited importance is a rule that makes it harder for people to cast a provisional ballot if they show up at the wrong precinct. (It’s worth noting that many states don’t count these ballots at all, and there were only around 10,000 total provisional ballots in Georgia in the last election, including those cast in the right precinct). — It shortens the runoff period. Runoffs would be held four weeks after an initial election, instead of the nine weeks that had been in place for federal elections in the last few years. A main consequence would be to shorten early runoff voting to one week, instead of three, plausibly affecting turnout in exactly the kind of close, low-turnout race where it could easily be decisive. — It empowers the state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. It removes the secretary of state as chair of the state board of elections and allows the Legislature to appoint a majority of the board’s members, including the chair. And it empowers the state board to take over county boards of elections, if the circumstances merit it. These might prove to be very important. But for the purposes of this article, we are not considering them “voter suppression” provisions. They do not inherently make it harder for people to vote by restricting whether or how they can vote. If we leave aside the administrative provisions and the question of intent, the core question on voter suppression is to what extent does reducing voting options — like early voting in the runoffs or mail voting in general — reduce turnout and Democratic chances? The limited import of convenience voting For decades, reformers have assumed that the way to increase turnout is to make voting easier. Yet surprisingly, expanding voting options to make it more convenient hasn’t seemed to have a huge effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. That’s the finding of decades of political science research on advance, early and absentee voting. One prominent study even found that early voting decreases turnout, though that’s a bit of an outlier. There’s essentially no evidence that the vast expansion of no-excuse absentee mail voting, in which anyone can apply for a mail absentee ballot, had any discernible effect on turnout in 2020. That shouldn’t be a huge surprise: Even universal vote by mail, in which every registered voter is automatically sent a mail ballot (as opposed to every voter having an opportunity to apply for one), increases turnout by only about 2% with no discernible partisan advantage. Believe it or not, turnout increased just as much in the states that didn’t have no-excuse absentee voting as it did in the states that added it for the first time. Similarly, Joe Biden improved over Hillary Clinton’s performance by 3 percentage points in the states that added it, compared with 2.9 points in the states that did not. A more rigorous study by political scientists at Stanford found that no-excuse mail voting might have increased turnout by a whopping 0.02% in the 2020 election. The study used a novel approach: The researchers compared the turnout among 65-year-olds in Texas, who were eligible to vote by mail without an excuse, with 64-year-olds in Texas, who weren’t. The turnout among 64-year-olds was indistinguishable from that of 65-year-olds, even though the latter group voted by mail in large numbers. Like Georgia, Texas did not require an identification to vote by mail, but has a strict ID requirement for in-person voting. The partisan makeup of the electorate didn’t appear to change, either. The Democratic share of voters appeared to tick up by two-tenths of a percentage point — enough to decide a very close election. But it’s also so small that it could just be statistical noise, with no effect at all. Social science methods just don’t offer the level of precision necessary to nail down whether this, or any, change might move the needle by a tenth of a point. The Georgia law doesn’t come anywhere close to eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, unlike what the political scientists tested in Texas. As a result, one might expect the new law to have an even smaller effect. (You could make a counterintuitive argument that making absentee voting harder is worse for Democrats than eliminating it altogether, and that Democrats might be better off discouraging people from mail voting to avoid unnecessary ballot rejections of people who could have successfully voted in person.) The Georgia runoff elections, while hardly a scientific case study, nonetheless offer another useful example. There were fewer opportunities to vote in advance compared with the general election, because of the shorter election campaign and the holiday season. Based on the drop-off in early voting, many analysts wound up underestimating the final turnout by 20% or more. In the end, turnout exceeded expectations. The number of Election Day voters was higher than it was in the general election, as many people who might have voted early if it weren’t for Christmas or New Year’s Day now turned out on Election Day. Maybe runoff turnout would have been higher with the same early voting opportunities as in the general. But maybe not. And none of this had any discernible negative effect on the Democrats, who of course did better than they did in the general. Why doesn’t convenience matter? How is it possible that something like eliminating no-excuse absentee mail voting, a method beloved by millions of voters, wouldn’t materially affect turnout or election results? One simple answer is that convenience isn’t as important as often assumed. Almost everyone who cares enough to vote will brave the inconveniences of in-person voting to do so, whether that’s because the inconveniences aren’t really so great, or because they care enough to suffer them. This supposes a certain reasonable level of convenience, of course: Six-hour lines would change the calculation for many voters. And indeed, long lines do affect turnout. It also supposes a certain level of interest. Someone might think: There’s no way I’m waiting a half-hour in line to vote for dogcatcher. Similarly, the importance of a convenient voting option probably grows as the significance of a race decreases. The implication, though, is that nearly every person will manage to vote if sufficiently convenient options are available, even if the most preferred option doesn’t exist. That makes the Georgia election law’s effort to curb long lines potentially quite significant. Not only might it mitigate the already limited effect of restricting mail voting, but it might even outweigh it. Also, convenience voting may not be as convenient for lower-turnout voters, who essentially decide overall turnout. Low-turnout voters probably aren’t thinking about how they’ll vote a month ahead of the election, when they’ll need to apply for an absentee ballot. Someone thinking about this is probably a high-turnout voter. Low-turnout voters might not even know until Election Day whom they’ll support. And that makes them less likely to take advantage of advance voting options like no-excuse early voting, which requires them to think about the election early and often: to submit an application, fill out a ballot and return it. As a result, convenience voting methods tend to reinforce the socioeconomic biases favoring high-turnout voters. The methods ensure that every high-interest voter has many opportunities to vote, without doing quite as much to draw less engaged voters to the polls. Another reason is that voting restrictions may backfire by angering and energizing Democratic voters. This law’s restrictions on handing out water in line, for instance, may do more to mobilize Democrats than to stop them from voting. One recent study even theorized that the Supreme Court’s decision to roll back elements of the Voting Rights Act didn’t reduce Black turnout because subsequent efforts to restrict voting were swiftly countered by efforts to mobilize Black voters. That doesn’t mean the Georgia law or other such laws are without consequence. Many make voting more difficult, enough to intimidate or discourage some voters. Many outright disenfranchise voters, even if only in small numbers. Perhaps the disenfranchisement of even a single voter merits outrage and opposition, especially if the law is passed on dubious or even fabricated grounds, and with Jim Crow mass disenfranchisement as a historical backdrop. But setting aside intent, it does mean that many such voting provisions, like that in Georgia, are unlikely to have a huge effect on turnout or Democratic chances. There are consequences to misunderstanding the stakes of changing voting laws. Minor changes in voting access can overshadow larger issues, including the kinds of potentially significant provisions in the Georgia law that empower the state Legislature. The HR 1 bill passed in the U.S. House by Democrats on a near party-line vote, for instance, would do quite a bit to expand voting access but relatively little to protect against partisan interference in election administration. The perception that voting laws have existential stakes for democracy or the political viability of the two parties has made bipartisan compromise extremely difficult. The virtue of bipartisanship is often and understandably dismissed as naive, but voting laws are a rare case where bipartisanship has value of its own. Democracy, after all, depends on the consent of the loser. This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

How to know if you can exercise after your COVID-19 vaccine or if you should just rest up,"One sports medicine doctor (not pictured) said pullups helped soothe his post-vaccine sore arm. Crystal Cox/Insider

No strong evidence shows how exercise right before or after the COVID-19 shot affects its efficacy.

Staying active supports your immune system, but overtraining can deplete it.

Listen to your body to gauge if you're feeling too low to work out.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The day after his second dose of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Kevin Bernstein did a long endurance ride on his Peloton - and achieved a personal best.

Hours after her second jab of the same vaccine, nurse Kristen Choi felt so chilled, nauseous, light-headed, and feverish she thought for a moment she had COVID-19.

As more Americans get both vaccinated and keep an eye toward their post-pandemic body goals, some are questioning if it's a good, bad, or neutral idea to work out right before or after the vaccine - if, unlike Choi, they feel up for it.

While there's no strong evidence showing that exercising around the time of your vaccine will increase or decrease its efficacy, Bernstein, the chief medical officer at Peaks Coaching Group, told Insider there are some things to keep in mind when planning your vaccines and fitness routines.

Don't force a workout if you're dragging, but try not to be too sedentary either

The available COVID-19 vaccines can come with side effects, which is simply a reflection of the immune system learning how to fight off the virus. Usually, symptoms are mild and last only a day or two.

Some of the the most commonly reported side effects include headaches, fatigue, chills, nausea, and dizziness, according to a January CDC report analyzing safety data on the nearly 13 million people who'd received a vaccine. In about 1% of people, the vaccine leads to a high (over 102 F) fever.

Women seem to be a lot more likely than men to report side effects, perhaps because estrogen elicits a stronger immune response. The second dose, too, tends to be more likely to elicit side effects, and some evidence suggests COVID-19 survivors may have more severe reactions.

""My advice to patients is to listen to your body,"" Bernstein said. ""If you have significant fatigue and fever, then it is likely not the day to do a high-intensity interval training workout. If you're not feeling it, see how you feel again tomorrow.""

However, try not to lie around the house all day either, he added. Even people who received a placebo vaccine in clinical trials reported side effects. ""I would still recommend at least getting outside for a nice walk and continuing to stay hydrated while your immune system works its magic,"" Bernstein said.

Overtraining ahead of the vaccine isn't smart

The vaccine works by training your immune system to fight off invaders that look like the coronavirus, so it's in your best interest to receive it with a system that's in good shape. In other words, you want to put your best players in the game, not those on the injured list.

That's why some experts have advised against taking painkillers or drinking alcohol before your vaccine.

Exercise, however, is something that can both support and deplete your immune system. Regular physical activity keeps it healthy, but overdoing it can backfire, Bernstein - who rode his Peloton as usual the days leading up to both doses - pointed out.

He said if you are at risk for overtraining syndrome - when you out-train your body's ability to recover - or have significantly amped up your workouts, dial it back ahead of the vaccine. Worsened performance, being moody, feeling a compulsion toward exercise, sleep problems, and more can all signal overtraining syndrome, something that should be discussed with a general practitioner or sports medicine doc, Bernstein said.

If you're training hard because of an upcoming race, consider timing your vaccine accordingly, if possible. ""I would not plan on getting the vaccine within a few days of a goal event, including planned training activities,"" Bernstein said.

Light arm exercises can help with injection site pain

The day of both doses, Bernstein did pullups, which alleviated his only symptom: a sore arm. While pullups may be too intense for people who don't already do them regularly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does advise people keep their arms active to help deal with site pain. A cool, wet washcloth and over-the-counter painkiller may help too.

""I believe there is a mental health component to getting a vaccine or any type of medical intervention. Exercise is a potent positive mental health coping mechanism. I believe that continuing to keep moving before and after the vaccine is important both for physical and mental health benefits,"" Bernstein said.

The New York Stock Exchange's massive post-COVID question,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 20: Traders, some in medical masks, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 20, 2020 in New York City. Trading on the floor will temporarily become fully electronic starting on Monday to protect employees from spreading the coronavirus. The Dow fell over 500 points on Friday as investors continue to show concerns over COVID-19. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)

A year ago last week, March 23, 2020 to be exact, as COVID-19 was beginning to ravage America, the New York Stock Exchange closed its trading floor and moved to all electronic trading. It was the first time in 228 years that the floor was closed but markets remained open. (The floor and trading were both shuttered for two days after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 and four days after 9/11, more on the latter, later.)

The move was said to be temporary and as it turned out the floor was completely shut for the next two months, only to reopen in May at 25% capacity. And that’s more or less where things stood until recently, when, Yahoo Finance has learned, the exchange opened up to 50% capacity, meaning some 160 brokers and traders are working the floor of the biggest stock market in the world, (with listed companies worth some $32 trillion.) Still a small fraction of the thousands who traded there only a few decades ago.

That all-electronic trading at the NYSE went off without a hitch—and during such a wild and crazy 12 months to boot—is both a positive and a negative for the exchange. On the one hand the past year showcased the NYSE’s remarkable technology. Bravo NYSE! On the other hand, it makes us realize once and for all that the guys in the funny jackets—the floor brokers, specialists and traders—were exactly what we thought they were, a colorful anachronism.

I don’t begrudge nor do I mean to disparage the men (and it has been almost entirely men) who worked or still work on the floor of the NYSE. (Full disclosure, one of my grand uncles and a first cousin once removed owned a seat on the exchange and were specialists for Sprint and some other stocks.) What I’m really saying is that middlemen, including those at the NYSE, are a dying breed in our economy, as technology and the internet have no use for them.

And now as the NYSE looks to go back to work, the jobs being brought back to the exchange have been shown to be redundant. As such the positions on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, this American institution, this epicenter of capitalism, are inexorably going the way of bank tellers, travel agents and newspaper delivery boys. When the NYSE fully acknowledges this, what its plan is, and what becomes of the trading floor are all unknown.

“There are floor haters,” counters Peter Tuchman, a trader for Quattro Securities. “There are press people who are not happy about the floor — just a stick up their a—. Everybody's business has been compromised by technology — publishing, news media, technology has come into all of our worlds. I don’t know why everybody thinks the floor is a waste of time. That it’s just a show. I think that’s all horse sh—. What the investment community said to us when we were closed is they were thrilled markets were open and tradeable but volatility and price discovery and liquidity were compromised by the lack of human beings.”

A note about Peter Tuchman who’s been working on the floor since 1985. Peter is known as the most photographed person on Wall Street because, well, with his animated expressions and his distinctive hair styles, he takes a great picture. (He’s not a bad quote either as you can see.) I remember decades ago, before I knew who he was, I just called him Market Dude. Tuchman has become the very personification of the floor, the NYSE, and even stock trading writ large.

When asked about going all electronic last year, NYSE Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund acknowledges it went well but said, “we did miss the human judgment and flexibility when the floor was closed. It saves investors money, providing more accurate prices and lower volatility. We found the floor, when open, saves investors about $10 million a day.”

With all due respect to Peter and Michael, maybe.

If I had a nickel for every time someone at the NYSE, from the CEO down to a junior clerk, explained to me that human trading added an element of fairness and liquidity that machines can’t match, I could have retired long ago. I do remember thinking during the Nasdaq’s botched Facebook IPO in 2012, ""hmm, maybe they have a point."" But that was an aberration and furthermore no one really knows if humans could have prevented those problems.

Truth be told, floor trading has been a bit of a buggy whip for quite some time. By 2007 most exchanges around the world had done away with in-person trading and the so-called ""open outcry"" system (which is exactly what it sounds like it is.) And indeed the NYSE began to pull in its horns around then, closing an additional trading floor that year and the Stock Exchange Lunch Club (infamous for reactionary practices), a year earlier. By 2017, only 10% of the NYSE’s volume was reportedly done in person. I remember someone years ago describing the floor to me as ""the world's longest funeral.""

“The New York Stock Exchange long ago became an electronic market,” said James Angel, associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business focused on markets and financial exchanges. “The New York Stock Exchange floor for many years has been mostly a media presence,” he said. Asked whether human interaction provides value for trading: “You would need a very powerful microscope to see the difference,” Angel responded.

Tuchman and Blaugrund would tell you if they had a nickel for every time someone told them that the trading floor and the NYSE’s landmark Beaux Arts building at 11 Wall Street and 18 Broad Street (it’s two structures) was nothing more than a very expensive, albeit effective, marketing platform for the exchange, they too could have retired long ago. But it certainly is that, an awesome-looking trading floor with what is essentially an exclusive old-school club upstairs, replete with a stunning board room, a signature antique clock, a secret dining room, an enormous Faberge vase (said to be the largest Faberge piece in the world), framed Civil War bonds, a Warhol, a Led Zeppelin guitar and lord knows what else. Honestly, the whole thing is very cool. People, i.e. CEOs, senators, heads of state and civilians alike all love to see this stuff.

So even if you accept that in-person trading does benefit investors, you also have to accept that it isn’t much, it’s less every year and that most of the value of physical exchange is for marketing.

Recently though, we found out that the NYSE is contemplating leaving the space and in fact leaving New York City altogether, or at least threatening to. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, NYSE president Stacey Cunningham warned the exchange might leave over a proposed financial transaction tax.

“The New York Stock Exchange belongs in New York. If Albany lawmakers get their way, however, the center of the global financial industry may need to find a new home…We’ve proved, by pandemic-driven necessity, that we can close the physical trading floor on a moment’s notice and maintain service without missing a beat.”

Cunningham mentioned Florida and Texas as tax-friendly states and lawmakers from both states wasted no time telling Cunningham to come on down, the taxes—and the weather—are fine.

For some more context here, remember that the Intercontinental Exchange bought the NYSE in 2013. (The company’s stock, ticker ICE, has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years btw.) ICE’s CEO is billionaire Jeff Sprecher, husband of former Georgia U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler. It’s been a rocky time for the couple, who came under fire for stock trades made after Loeffler was privately briefed early last year as a government official regarding the dangers of the COVID pandemic. (A Senate Ethics Committee probe later cleared the couple.) Loeffler lost her high profile Senate race to Raphael Warnock, and she sold her WNBA team the Atlanta Dream after clashing with players over their support for Black Lives Matter.

Before I comment more on the disposition of the exchange and its trading floor, I want to go into some NYSE history, by no means all of it, because that could and does fill many books, but just a few interesting bits. You might know how the exchange was founded in 1792 by 24 brokers who gathered underneath a buttonwood tree in downtown Manhattan to hammer out some principles. Fun fact: One of the signers of the Buttonwood Agreement which of course the NYSE displays, was Leonard Bleecker, the namesake of Bleecker Street.

Before its august buildings were constructed, NYSE trading took place in a number of locations, including the Tontine Coffee House, all settings for countless panics, runs, crashes and routes as well as melt-ups, crazy rallies and blow outs. The exchange has been and continues to be a real-time roller coaster scorekeeping mechanism of the American economy. What could possibly be wilder than that?

Besides the market action though, the New York Stock Exchange has witnessed a full assortment of historical drama: A massive unsolved bombing in 1920 nearly in front of the exchange which killed 40 people. (It was a horse-drawn wagon bomb. Can you imagine?) On the other side of things, there was the time Abbie Hoffman and his band of Yippies invaded the gallery of the exchange in 1967 and showered the floor with dollar bills.

And remember the New York Sack Exchange? That was the name given to the New York Jets ferocious defensive line, Gastineau, Klecko, Salaam and Lyons who were invited to ring the opening bell at the NYSE in November 1981.

For the 1987 movie “Wall Street,” Oliver Stone received rare permission to shoot on the NYSE floor during trading hours. (Sidenote: My other favorite Wall Street movie, “Trading Places,” was shot in 1982 in the COMEX at 4 World Trade Center—the filmmakers were first turned down by the Chicago Merc—on a weekend, because Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd were too much of a distraction during market hours.)

On Aug. 4, 1995, Maria Bartiromo (before she went all deep Fox) became the first journalist to report live from the floor of the exchange where she was often bumped and jostled, sometimes intentionally it seemed, in the then mayhem that often consumed the floor. Those were the days my trader friends.

The following decade brought us the Shakespearean mega scandal over the $188 million pay package given to then NYSE CEO Dick Grasso, with billionaire and NYSE director, Ken Langone as Grasso’s ally. Those two warred bitterly against their nemesis, then New York State Attorney General Elliot Spitzer. In the end Grasso won because a judge ruled that when the NYSE went from a nonprofit to for profit corporation, NYSE no longer fell under the state’s purview.

Along the way I had a few NYSE experiences too. I’ve rung the bell there twice, once wearing a top hat. (Of course all kinds of other riffraff besides me have been bell ringers: A few of my favorites: Snoop, Darth Vader and Mr. Potato Head.) But my most memorable NYSE experience actually took place about a mile and a half away from the exchange, at 5 Penn Plaza, on Monday, September 17, 2001, the day the stock exchange resumed trading after 9/11.

First, remember the exchange never opened on Tuesday 9/11 and then was closed the rest of the week because of the immediate dangers from the site of the terrorist attack just blocks away, as well as for Americans and the economy to get their bearings. And so reopening the exchange was the stuff of the highest drama—and it happened to be my very first day working for CNN.

At around 8:45 a.m., I entered the building which was near Madison Square Garden and was directed up to a floor with a terrace facing south overlooking the still smoldering ruin of what used to be the Twin Towers. I was shown over to two directors' chairs, one occupied by the anchor Paula Zahn. We were introduced and Paula asked me, “Do you know about the stock market and all that, because it’s not my area of expertise.” Affirmative, I answered. “Oh,” she added, “we’re going to Lou Dobbs, who’s on the floor of the exchange. Are you good with that?” Also affirmative. (This was before Dobbs went all deep Fox.) Paula and I chatted a bit (we would work together for a number of years after) until the director counted us in to the market open at 9:30 a.m. I knew it was going to be a bloodbath and it was. And Paula, Lou and I covered it live. The Dow fell 684 points, a 7.1% decline, (airlines and insurance stocks fared even worse) a record at the time for biggest one session loss.

It was a day I will never forget. But I know that a million other people have a million other powerful memories of the NYSE too. That’s why, the physical NYSE and its trading floor really are a thing.

NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 11: Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange participate in a moment of silence in remembrance of the events of September 11, 2001 on September 11, 2015 in New York City. Throughout the nation people are holding somber gatherings and memorial events to reflect on the 14-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that resulted in the loss of nearly 3,000 people. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)

And it can’t just disappear. So says the exchange at least.

First, the NYSE’s Blaugrund confirmed that the exchange was looking to go back to full capacity. ""We certainly intend to, but we don’t have a timeline.” he said. “Hopefully, we can get back to an ordinary course of business sometime this year.”

What about the future?

“Unequivocally, we're going to continue to have an active robust floor as part of the NYSE,” Blaugrund said. “The floor itself adds a lot of value to issuers and investors. It is a core part of our DNA.""

Really? But how can the exchange justify the expense of the process of human interaction, never mind maintaining the building (which it owns, but still?) Blaugrund hints at something in the works: “We’re investing in a new generation of technology for the floor brokers and for our options trading floor,” he said. “All will come online over the next 24 months. This is something that’s part of our past and present but also part of our future.”

Hmm, I’m intrigued.

Fifty years ago, February 8, 1971, to be exact, the Nasdaq began operations as the world's first electronic stock market. Yep, the Nasdaq kind of figured it out from the get go. Tellingly, it’s even not apparent who the key personalities were in creating the exchange. (It appears Gordon Macklin for one was instrumental.) Contrast that with the 24 signers of the Buttonwood Agreement from the 18th century. That contrast speaks volumes to the different paths the NYSE and Nasdaq have taken.

Of course the NYSE has now gone whole hog following Nasdaq's technology lead. But even as the Nasdaq has pooh-poohed the NYSE as an in-person dinosaur, the all-tech exchange has added more pizazz and real-time features to its Times Square MarketSite headquarters over the years. With the giant neon video billboard, the bell-ringing, the meeting rooms, the huge new cocktail space and terrace, Nasdaq spends a fortune on in-person New York City marketing too. So what does that tell you?

Kenny Polcari, chief executive of Kace Capital Advisors, who worked on the floor of the NYSE for 38 years until he left in 2019, reminisced a bit about his time on the floor: “I was there during what I would consider the greatest period for markets: The 80s and 90s and early part of the 21st century because it was energetic, exciting. It was 5,500 type-A personalities in the place. It was everything you could possibly imagine about being at the heart of capitalism.

“Could you make the argument it’s all electronic and we don’t need it? Of course you could,” Polcari said. “People can say [the exchange] doesn’t matter; it does matter. [Executives from] a listed company whose market is the New York Stock Exchange still absolutely love to go there. They love to bring their business there, their company there to show it off. It says something about who you are as a company when you are listed at the New York Stock Exchange. It’s part of the fabric of the nation and it’s got this presence that people around the world are just amazed with. It is an incredible American institution.”

But will there be people on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 20 years Kenny? “No, I don’t think so,” he said. “I’m not sure there will be people on the floor in five years.”

Then what will be there? Though the NYSE is loath to admit it, the exchange does need the physical presence for…gulp...marketing. Will the exchange ever own up to the floor just being that? And would that make the floor, less of a thing?

As the NYSE now returns to work from its COVID winter, this is its $32 trillion problem to figure out.

"Suez Canal shipping backlog ends, days after giant vessel freed","Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- With the sun rising outside their conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the visitors to a secretive investment empire bent their heads in prayerful meditation.It was another Friday morning, 7 o’clock, and a familiar scene was unfolding again inside Archegos Capital Management, an obscure family office that would go on to shake the financial world.In the days before the pandemic, 20 or 30 people would squeeze together around the long table and, over coffee and Danishes, listen to recordings of the Bible, according to people who were there.First might come the Old Testament, perhaps Isaiah or Lamentations. Then came the New, the Gospels, which called out to the listeners drawn from a path known more for its earthly greed than its godly faith: Wall Street.Hitting the play button and then receding into the background was the host, Bill Hwang, the mysterious billionaire trader now at the center of one of the biggest Wall Street fiascos of all time.The story thus far -- of a mind-boggling fortune made in stealth and then wiped out very publicly in a blink -- has sent shock waves through some of the world’s mightiest banks. Estimates of the potential size of his position before it imploded have spiraled toward $100 billion. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the disaster, which has set teeth on edge in trading rooms across the globe.But those accounts tell only part of the story. Interviews with people from inside Hwang’s circle, Wall Street players close to him and documents associated with his multimillion-dollar charitable foundation fill in missing puzzle pieces -- ones that haven’t been reported previously.The picture that emerges is unlike anything Wall Street might suspect.There are, in a sense, not one but two Bill Hwangs.Christian CapitalistOne of them walks for hours through New York’s Central Park listening to recordings of the Bible and embraces a new, 21st-century vision of an age-old ideal: that of a modern Christian capitalist, a financial speculator for Christ, who seeks to make money in God’s name and then use it to further the faith. A generous benefactor to a range of unglamorous, mostly conservative Christian causes, this Hwang eschews the trappings of extravagant wealth, rides the bus, flies commercial and lives in what is, by billionaire standards, humble surroundings in suburban New Jersey.Then there’s the other Bill Hwang: a former acolyte of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson with a thirst for risk and a stomach for volatile markets -- a daring trader who once lost a fortune betting against German automaker Volkswagen AG while running a hedge fund that was supposedly focused on Asian stocks.This is also the Bill Hwang who then went on to quietly become one of the most successful alumni of Robertson’s vaunted Tiger Management. This one masks his dangerous leveraged bets from public view via financial derivatives, was once accused of insider trading and pleaded guilty in 2012 to wire fraud on behalf of his hedge fund, Tiger Asia Management.That same Bill Hwang, it turns out, is also a backer of one of Wall Street’s hottest hands of late, Cathie Wood of Ark Investments. Like Hwang, Wood is known to hold Bible study meetings and figures into what some refer to as the “faith in finance” movement.And here, at last, is where the Bill Hwangs collide. The fortune he amassed under the noses of major banks and financial regulators was far bigger and riskier than almost anyone might have thought possible -- and these riches were pulled together with head-snapping speed. In fact, it was perhaps one of the greatest accumulations of private wealth in the history of modern finance.And Hwang lost it all even faster.Breakneck SpeedArchegos -- a Greek word often translated as “author” or “captain,” and often considered a reference to Jesus -- was believed by many traders doing business with the firm to be sitting atop $10 billion of assets. That figure, representing Hwang’s personal fortune, was actually closer to $20 billion, according to people who did business with Archegos.To put that figure in context: Bill Hwang, a name few even on Wall Street had heard until now, was worth more than well-known industry figures like Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen and David Tepper.Even more remarkable is the breakneck speed at which Hwang’s fortune grew. Archegos started out in 2013 with an estimated $200 million. That’s a sizable fortune but nowhere near big money in the hedge fund game.Yet within a decade, Hwang’s fortune swelled 100 times over, traders and bankers now estimate. Much of those riches accrued in the past 12 to 24 months alone, as Hwang began to employ more and more leverage to goose his returns, and as banks, eager for his lucrative trading business, eagerly obliged by extending him credit.Hwang’s success enabled him to endow his own charity, the Grace & Mercy Foundation, which had almost $500 million of assets as of 2018, according to its most recent tax filing.One institution close to Hwang, and a beneficiary of his foundation, is The King’s College, a small Christian school in the heart of New York’s Financial District.In a statement to Bloomberg, the college said it was grateful for his generosity and that “our prayers are with Mr. Hwang and his staff.”McDonald’s JobThe story of both Bill Hwangs begins in South Korea, where he was born Sung Kook Hwang in 1964. The tale he has told friends and associates is a familiar one of immigrant striving -- followed by financial success that few even on Wall Street can fathom.Hwang grew up in a religious household (like roughly a third of Koreans, his parents were Christian). When he was a teenager, the family moved to Las Vegas, where his father got a job as a pastor at a local church. Hwang has told friends that he arrived in the U.S. unable to speak or write in English and only picked up the language while working nights at McDonald’s. Soon after, his father died and his mother moved the family to Los Angeles. Hwang went on to study economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, and then picked up an MBA at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.Finance beckoned -- and Hwang, it turned out, was very good at it. While a lowly salesman at Hyundai Securities, part of the sprawling Korean chaebol the Hyundai Group, he caught Julian Robertson’s eye. Hwang, not yet 33, was then handed a golden ticket to Wall Street: an offer to join Robertson’s Tiger Management, then at the top of its game.Hwang quickly distinguished himself by introducing Robertson to the Korean markets -- at the time headed into the teeth of the Asian financial crisis -- and masterminding what turned into a lucrative stake in SK Telecom Co.Hamptons LunchTiger colleagues say Hwang was one of Robertson’s most successful proteges -- a quiet, methodical analyst with intense focus. Even today, he keeps his desk free of all clutter, the better to focus his mind. Robertson, these people recall, dubbed him “the Michael Jordan of Asian investing.”Robertson, now 88, still considers Hwang a friend, and the two lunched together in the Hamptons a few months ago.“He’s not one to be tiny, that’s one thing for sure,” Robertson told Bloomberg after news of the Archegos losses broke.Hwang would eventually strike out on his own as a so-called Tiger cub. Initially, Hwang shot the lights out, returning an annualized 40% through 2007, when he managed $8 billion.The hot streak didn’t last. In late 2008, his Tiger Asia incurred stinging losses on a big bet against Volkswagen. Many other hedge funds were shorting the German automaker, too, and when Porsche Automobil Holding SE abruptly announced that it would raise its stake, all hell broke loose. VW soared 348% within 48 hours, crushing shorts like Hwang.Tiger Asia ended the year down 23%. Many investors pulled their money, angry that a hedge fund that was supposed to be focusing on Asia somehow got caught up in the massive squeeze.GameStop FrenzyIt was a painful and instructive lesson for Hwang, people who know him say. In the future, he’d hunt out stocks that many traders were shorting and go long instead. Millions of amateur investors took up that approach this year during the social media-fueled frenzy over GameStop and other stocks.But before the next success, Tiger Asia ran into more trouble -- this time, trouble big enough to bring Hwang’s days as a hedge fund manager to an end.When Tiger Asia pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2012, the SEC said the firm used inside information to trade in shares of two Chinese banks. Hwang and his firm ended up paying $60 million to settle the criminal and civil charges. The SEC banned him from managing outside money and Hong Kong authorities prohibited him from trading there for four years (the ban ended in 2018).Shut out of hedge funds, Hwang opened Archegos, a family office. The firm, which recently employed some 50 people, initially occupied space in the Renzo Piano-designed headquarters of the New York Times. Today it’s based further uptown, by Columbus Circle, sharing its address with the Grace & Mercy Foundation.“My journey really began when I was having a lot of problems in our business about five or six years ago,” Hwang said in a 2017 video. “And I knew one thing, that this was a situation where money and connections couldn’t really help. But somehow I was reminded I had to go to the words of the God.”That belief helped Hwang rebuild his financial empire at dizzying speed as banks loaned him billions of dollars to ratchet up his bets that unraveled spectacularly as the financial firms panicked. What ensued was one of the greatest margin calls of all time, pushing his giant portfolio into liquidation. Some of the banks may end up with combined losses of as much as $10 billion, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co.Leveraged Blowout: How Hwang’s Archegos Blindsided Global BanksAs a bruised Wall Street points its collective finger at Hwang, his Christian associates have rallied around him.Doug Birdsall, honorary co-chairman of the Lausanne Movement, a global group that seeks to mobilize evangelical leaders, said Hwang always likes to think big. When he met with him to discuss a new 30-story building in New York for the American Bible Society, Hwang said, “Why build 30 stories? Build it 66 stories high. There are 66 books in the bible.”Before so much went so wrong so fast, Archegos appeared to be ramping up. A year ago, Hwang petitioned the SEC to let him work or run a broker-dealer; the SEC agreed.It’s impossible to say where Bill Hwang, the hard-charging financial speculator, ends, and Bill Hwang, the Christian evangelist and philanthropist, begins. People who know him say the one is inseparable from the other. Despite brushes with regulators, staggering trading losses and the question swirling around his market dealings, they say Hwang often speaks of bridging God and mammon, of bringing Christian teaching to the money-centric world of Wall Street.”If you know how Bill lives, you will never think this man is worth the kind of money he was,” said John Bai, a finance executive who’s known Hwang for 30 years. “Maybe for some it’s an epic disappearance of wealth, but he’s got God on his side. I am not worried about Bill. He’s not about the money.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",
How to make your Facebook News Feed a less divisive place,"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- With the sun rising outside their conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the visitors to a secretive investment empire bent their heads in prayerful meditation.It was another Friday morning, 7 o’clock, and a familiar scene was unfolding again inside Archegos Capital Management, an obscure family office that would go on to shake the financial world.In the days before the pandemic, 20 or 30 people would squeeze together around the long table and, over coffee and Danishes, listen to recordings of the Bible, according to people who were there.First might come the Old Testament, perhaps Isaiah or Lamentations. Then came the New, the Gospels, which called out to the listeners drawn from a path known more for its earthly greed than its godly faith: Wall Street.Hitting the play button and then receding into the background was the host, Bill Hwang, the mysterious billionaire trader now at the center of one of the biggest Wall Street fiascos of all time.The story thus far -- of a mind-boggling fortune made in stealth and then wiped out very publicly in a blink -- has sent shock waves through some of the world’s mightiest banks. Estimates of the potential size of his position before it imploded have spiraled toward $100 billion. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the disaster, which has set teeth on edge in trading rooms across the globe.But those accounts tell only part of the story. Interviews with people from inside Hwang’s circle, Wall Street players close to him and documents associated with his multimillion-dollar charitable foundation fill in missing puzzle pieces -- ones that haven’t been reported previously.The picture that emerges is unlike anything Wall Street might suspect.There are, in a sense, not one but two Bill Hwangs.Christian CapitalistOne of them walks for hours through New York’s Central Park listening to recordings of the Bible and embraces a new, 21st-century vision of an age-old ideal: that of a modern Christian capitalist, a financial speculator for Christ, who seeks to make money in God’s name and then use it to further the faith. A generous benefactor to a range of unglamorous, mostly conservative Christian causes, this Hwang eschews the trappings of extravagant wealth, rides the bus, flies commercial and lives in what is, by billionaire standards, humble surroundings in suburban New Jersey.Then there’s the other Bill Hwang: a former acolyte of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson with a thirst for risk and a stomach for volatile markets -- a daring trader who once lost a fortune betting against German automaker Volkswagen AG while running a hedge fund that was supposedly focused on Asian stocks.This is also the Bill Hwang who then went on to quietly become one of the most successful alumni of Robertson’s vaunted Tiger Management. This one masks his dangerous leveraged bets from public view via financial derivatives, was once accused of insider trading and pleaded guilty in 2012 to wire fraud on behalf of his hedge fund, Tiger Asia Management.That same Bill Hwang, it turns out, is also a backer of one of Wall Street’s hottest hands of late, Cathie Wood of Ark Investments. Like Hwang, Wood is known to hold Bible study meetings and figures into what some refer to as the “faith in finance” movement.And here, at last, is where the Bill Hwangs collide. The fortune he amassed under the noses of major banks and financial regulators was far bigger and riskier than almost anyone might have thought possible -- and these riches were pulled together with head-snapping speed. In fact, it was perhaps one of the greatest accumulations of private wealth in the history of modern finance.And Hwang lost it all even faster.Breakneck SpeedArchegos -- a Greek word often translated as “author” or “captain,” and often considered a reference to Jesus -- was believed by many traders doing business with the firm to be sitting atop $10 billion of assets. That figure, representing Hwang’s personal fortune, was actually closer to $20 billion, according to people who did business with Archegos.To put that figure in context: Bill Hwang, a name few even on Wall Street had heard until now, was worth more than well-known industry figures like Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen and David Tepper.Even more remarkable is the breakneck speed at which Hwang’s fortune grew. Archegos started out in 2013 with an estimated $200 million. That’s a sizable fortune but nowhere near big money in the hedge fund game.Yet within a decade, Hwang’s fortune swelled 100 times over, traders and bankers now estimate. Much of those riches accrued in the past 12 to 24 months alone, as Hwang began to employ more and more leverage to goose his returns, and as banks, eager for his lucrative trading business, eagerly obliged by extending him credit.Hwang’s success enabled him to endow his own charity, the Grace & Mercy Foundation, which had almost $500 million of assets as of 2018, according to its most recent tax filing.One institution close to Hwang, and a beneficiary of his foundation, is The King’s College, a small Christian school in the heart of New York’s Financial District.In a statement to Bloomberg, the college said it was grateful for his generosity and that “our prayers are with Mr. Hwang and his staff.”McDonald’s JobThe story of both Bill Hwangs begins in South Korea, where he was born Sung Kook Hwang in 1964.

Half of UK firms expect long-term post-Brexit disruption-survey,"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- Stronger-than-forecast March hiring pushed up U.S. stock futures on Friday and sowed optimism among investing professionals who said vaccines, easing lockdowns and ongoing government stimulus bode well for markets after the S&P 500 surged past 4,000. Several warned the pace of growth will eventually pressure the Federal Reserve, which has vowed years of near-zero rates.“We were expecting a big number and today’s jobs report delivered in a major way,” said Eric Merlis, head of global markets trading at Citizens Bank. “It is the flip side of what we saw for March of last year and another clear sign that the U.S. economy is on a strong path to recovery.”Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 last month and February employment was revised up to a 468,000 gain, according to a Labor Department report Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 6%, as the workforce participation rate edged higher. June contracts on the S&P 500, trading in an abbreviated Good Friday session, extended gains, rising 0.6% to 4,030.5 as of 8:53 a.m. in New York.Here’s what investors and strategists were saying:Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management“With 280,000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector added, it is a clear signal that pockets of the economy that have been hit by pandemic restrictions are starting to come back to life,” he said. “Overall, the payroll data suggests that the labor market has begun to turn around, but we still have a long way to go.”Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer at Marketfield Asset Management LLC “The overall picture adds to the sense that monetary and fiscal policy are out of whack with the overall economy,” he said. “Although we understand that this is currently an explicit aim of both the Federal Reserve and Biden administration, the odds of unintended consequences has increased.”Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics“Overall, particular segments of the labor market -- like leisure & hospitality and education -- remain weak because of the ongoing restrictions. But the opposite is true in many other sectors, with job openings soaring and voluntary quit rates already back to pre-pandemic levels. The upshot is that an acceleration in wage growth in those better-placed sectors could add to the upward pressure on prices this year.”Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services“The initial knee-jerk reaction is positive. For today, the market is focused on this reinforcing that the economy is going to be strong and that strength should help corporate profitability as a whole. We still think there will be this tug-of-war over the coming months over this really positive economic data and how much good data before the Fed flinches or changes their posture?”Priya Misra, global head of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities“This is an overall very solid report. Headline, participation, even average hourly earnings -- all good news. I think it is justifying the rise in Treasury rates, but the market is too optimistic about Fed hikes.”“We still like the 5-year sector and think it will struggle to go over 1%. The long-end is tougher. The deficit is $3.6 trillion this year, so will need to attract people for all the Treasury auctions coming up. Still forecasting 10s to reach 2% later this year.”Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer for Bleakley Advisory Group“The uptrend in rates will likely resume. As life is always a trade off, markets and the economy are as well. The better the economy gets, the higher rates go, which itself will eventually become its own speed bump if it continues,” he said. “Equities will continue to be an either/or market. If rates rise, the Nasdaq will underperform everything else, and vice versa.”Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank, told Bloomberg TV and Radio“When the year is all set and done, we’ll see the United States economy growing at a more rapid pace than China for the first time in over 40 years.”“The big hope is that this growth is sustainable, that it’s not inflationary. Of course, there’s going to be imbalances, but from a global growth standpoint, the U.S. is definitely in the lead.”Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.“While we still have a long way to go to repair the damage that was done to the economy last year, we’re making good progress.” “The improving job market should increase consumer spending and that coupled with the twin tailwinds of continued monetary and fiscal stimulus is what is going to propel the stock market higher this year.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",
March jobs report shows ‘the best is yet to come’: economist,"Joe Brusuelas, RSM chief economist and Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the latest jobs report and market outlook.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: All right, let's stay on the jobs report and talk a bit more about what you take out of these numbers. We're joined now by Joe Brusuelas. He is the Chief Economist over at RSM. We're also joined by Emily Roland, the co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. Thanks to you both for jumping on this morning. Joe, let's just start with your view on this jobs figure and kind of how you're thinking about these numbers, given we've seen a 900-plus, 1,000 non-farm payroll report.

JOE BRUSUELAS: All right, so not only were the jobs created strong across the board, they were also clustered in some very high-paying industries. If you look at those additions in goods producing, 183,000, construction, 110,000, manufacturing, 53,000, government, 136,000, education and health, 101,000-- this is a boomer of a jobs report.

Moreover, if you add in the, what was it, 156,000 back revisions over the past two months, we had over a million jobs. Turns out, my forecast of just a million wasn't quite optimistic enough. Hey, look, when you look at the composition of this, I come to one conclusion-- the best is yet to come.

JULIE HYMAN: So if the best is yet to come, Emily, is the best you have to come for the markets, right? I mean, it feels like stocks have been pricing in some pretty optimistic numbers when it comes to GDP, when it comes to jobs. Are they? Or I mean, we're seeing futures take a leg up. How are you thinking about these numbers?

EMILY ROLAND: Yeah, thanks for having me this morning, everybody. And, Julie, I think you're right-- this story is really becoming about, you know, the economy just booming this year. And in some sense for investors, that's kind of a gimme. You know, we're coming off really depressed levels.

Story continues

We still have 8 and 1/2 million jobs left to restore, but there's a lot of momentum right now. And this report this morning was awesome. We are seeing futures up here a little bit. The bond market, you're seeing a little bit of a back up in treasuries. But a lot of this has been priced in. So if you think back to 2020, that was really a market of multiple expansion-- of stocks moving higher in anticipation of this reopening, in anticipation of vaccines being rolled out in the US.

And now it's really more of a show-me story. You know, is the hard data going to show up and exceed or meet these lofty expectations that the markets have priced in? And in our view, it's going to be a little bit more challenging to get those exceptional returns in the market as we head forward.

We are confident that this better economic backdrop will feed through to corporate earnings. And so we do think that that earnings engine is going to be there in order to kick markets into gear and continue to climb higher here this year.

BRIAN SOZZI: So, Emily, in addition to the headline coming in strong, 916,000, you had 156,000 worth of upward revisions to jobs in January and February. So all that is good, positive-- clearly, the economy is kicking into gear. So come Monday morning, are you rotating out of value and back into growth?

Because I would make the argument that it's time for growth to start picking up here. It hasn't done well, but these jobs numbers say, growth should be doing well in this type of environment.

EMILY ROLAND: You know, I would expect that the rotation into more cyclical or economically-sensitive parts of the market to continue here. So you know, I do think that value will continue to catch a bid as the economy is turbo-charged here with more fiscal stimulus and vaccine rollouts. That really benefits areas like financials and industrials, which are our favorite pick. The other way that I would think about this, though, is from a US versus non-US equity standpoint.

This report is providing further evidence that there is a multi-speed economic growth backdrop unfolding here with the US economy accelerating faster than the rest of the world, with potentially the exception of China. So for us, that's meant having an overweight the US equities, and looking to areas like US financials and US value to play the cyclical rotation, and having an underweight to European equities as, unfortunately, their economic growth backdrop is stalling a little bit.

MYLES UDLAND: You know, Joe, you mentioned the best is yet to come, at least in your view, given what we've seen in these numbers. How unique of a period, then, given kind of how you've seen the economy evolve over your career, how unique a period are we heading into, where we're going to be looking at seven-figure job gains, we could be looking at GDP prints in the high single-digits, maybe even a 10% quarter at some point this year? And how challenging might it be for investors and the broader kind of market community to see through these numbers, understand them for what they are instead of have the inflationistas come out and start calling for overheating and all these sorts of things that you know are certainly coming?

JOE BRUSUELAS: OK, this is going to be the best growth we've seen since the 1980s-- the best job creation we've seen in terms of the composition since the 1980s. Just because you're seeing an economy reflate, it does not necessarily follow that you're going to have inflation. In fact, I think one of the major arguments back in the 1980s was, well, we can have quality growth without having inflation.

And I would make the case that, well, we're going to see inflation rise just due to year ago base effects, largely due to the recovery in the price of oil. Remember, a year ago March, oil was averaging $31 a barrel. It was $61 a barrel last month. So you're going to get the arithmetic of that.

But then you're going to see it ease, simply because this economy is about-- it's just ready to take off. When you unpack those numbers further, you can begin to see the reflation in restaurant and bar hiring. That's where a lot of the damage was. Now, I do think there are a couple-- there are two major policy takeaways here.

First, when you take a look at the fiscal aid that's in train into the economy, I think you could see better reports in April, May, and/or June. I mean, you're going to see some really, really strong numbers here. Second, I think this does pull forward the clock when we're going to see the Fed begin to openly talk about tapering operations later next year. And of course, that will likely pull forward the first rate hike into 2023.

Now, I don't think the Fed's going to move off of one report. But if the type of composition in terms of hiring-- and, of course, you're going to see some nice wage data going forward as people begin to work again, in addition to the trillions of dollars sitting in cash accounts in household savings. It's hard to make the case here that you're just not going to see the best economy in anyone's memory, really in our career arcs. These are going to be-- this is going to be just an exciting year. And I expect 2022 to be just as strong.

BRIAN SOZZI: Well, Joe, let's stay on policy here, because, clearly, the economy is kicking into high gear. And I remember you telling us last month we were looking at a million-plus job gains in the months ahead. And I imagine this is a pretty good day for the Biden administration. Does this make the case easier for him that this economy can handle higher corporate taxes, this economy can handle higher taxes on people making more than $400,000 without, you know, the economy tanking?

JOE BRUSUELAS: Right. And we saw that in the 1990s when taxes did go up, but the rate of growth was so strong, people really didn't notice. If I'm thinking about this-- well, pre-tax-- pre-tax hike, I would have thought next year we'd have about 5% growth. Well, that may be closer to 4% if they follow through and get the sort of tax plan that they're proposing. We're in early days. We don't know-- we're at a lot of speculation here.

I think in terms of policy, though, you see growth like we're going to see this year, you see these employment numbers, people start to feel a lot more confident, that gives the Biden demonstration greater degrees of freedom to pursue their very ambitious infrastructure policy. As an economist when I look at that infrastructure proposal, I don't really see spending, I don't really see taxes.

What I see is, OK, if they do this, this will result in a 4/10 to 5/10 of a increase in productivity per annum. Now today, productivity means very little. But over the long-term, it's absolutely everything. That's how we increase the living standard, the overall welfare of the economy and the nation.

You stick the landing on vaccines, you stick the landing on resuscitating the labor market, people are going to let you engage in transformational projects such as infrastructure. So one would imagine our friends over at the Council of Economic Advisors inside the White House, big smile on their faces as they're looking at their terminals this morning.

MYLES UDLAND: All right, Joe Brusuelas, Emily Roland, thank you both for jumping on this morning. Hope you guys both get to enjoy a long weekend on the other side of this. And I know we'll talk to both of you quite soon-- really appreciate your time this morning.

EMILY ROLAND: Thank you.",
"U.S. adds 916K jobs in March, unemployment rate at 6%","Bloomberg

But the opposite is true in many other sectors, with job openings soaring and voluntary quit rates already back to pre-pandemic levels. The upshot is that an acceleration in wage growth in those better-placed sectors could add to the upward pressure on prices this year.”Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services“The initial knee-jerk reaction is positive. For today, the market is focused on this reinforcing that the economy is going to be strong and that strength should help corporate profitability as a whole. We still think there will be this tug-of-war over the coming months over this really positive economic data and how much good data before the Fed flinches or changes their posture?”Priya Misra, global head of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities“This is an overall very solid report. Headline, participation, even average hourly earnings -- all good news. I think it is justifying the rise in Treasury rates, but the market is too optimistic about Fed hikes.”“We still like the 5-year sector and think it will struggle to go over 1%. The long-end is tougher. The deficit is $3.6 trillion this year, so will need to attract people for all the Treasury auctions coming up. Still forecasting 10s to reach 2% later this year.”Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer for Bleakley Advisory Group“The uptrend in rates will likely resume. As life is always a trade off, markets and the economy are as well. The better the economy gets, the higher rates go, which itself will eventually become its own speed bump if it continues,” he said. “Equities will continue to be an either/or market. If rates rise, the Nasdaq will underperform everything else, and vice versa.”Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank, told Bloomberg TV and Radio“When the year is all set and done, we’ll see the United States economy growing at a more rapid pace than China for the first time in over 40 years.”“The big hope is that this growth is sustainable, that it’s not inflationary. Of course, there’s going to be imbalances, but from a global growth standpoint, the U.S. is definitely in the lead.”Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.“While we still have a long way to go to repair the damage that was done to the economy last year, we’re making good progress.” “The improving job market should increase consumer spending and that coupled with the twin tailwinds of continued monetary and fiscal stimulus is what is going to propel the stock market higher this year.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",
Is Amazon stock silly cheap?,"Benzinga

Benzinga has examined the prospects for many investor favorite stocks over the past week. The past week's bullish calls included airlines, Chinese EV makers and a consumer electronics giant. An auto giant and a new exchange-traded fund were among the bearish calls that were seen. The quarter-ending, holiday-shortened week concluded with the Nasdaq up 2.6% but the Dow Jones industrials only fractionally higher. The first quarter ended with the S&P 500 near record highs, and it was above 4,000 at week's end. The 10-year Treasury yield was up to about 1.7%. The market seemed unconcerned about the prospects for a corporate tax hike and even appeared to like the White House's huge infrastructure spending plan. However, volatility increased last week, and the Russell 2000 index took a hit. It seems chip shortages will be a problem for a while. An aerospace giant struggling to get back on its feet announced big orders last week, as did the leading electric vehicle maker. That EV maker also teamed up with the iPhone maker, though they won't be making cars together. There were rumors about new products from the latter though. Furthermore, there was fresh good news about the COVID-19 vaccines, New York became the 15th state to legalize recreational marijuana, and a social media giant received good news from the U.S. Supreme Court. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors.

NFL's new 17-game season will change how I train: Kansas City Chief star Patrick Mahomes,"NFL phenom Patrick Mahomes may still be only 25 years old, but even his youthful healthy self will have to alter how he trains to make it successfully through the NFL's new 17 game regular season.

""I mean obviously it'll be different and it'll be something that we'll have to adjust to. But it's something that we had talked about in the collective bargaining agreement. Whatever your beliefs are you got to go out there and adjust, and do whatever you can to be the best football player you can be every single day. I'll be trying to figure out ways to take care of my body more and more, so you can adjust your body for a 17 game regular season,"" the star Kansas City Chiefs QB told Yahoo Finance Presents.

In a widely expected move after the new 2020 collective bargaining agreement, the league's owners voted this week to extend the regular season by one game to 17 from 16. The pre-season will be shortened to three games from four.

The Super Bowl will be played on Feb. 13, 2022 as opposed to Feb. 6. The addition of the extra regular season is expected to upend everything from football records to how players train and recover.

Super Bowl champion Mahomes is already in full preparation mode.

""You'll have to change your day-to-day work, work ethic, work involvement and how much you're going to put on your body every single day because you want to be in that Super Bowl again and you want to be playing for a championship and you want to make sure your body can take the workload of that and adding in another game is adding more to your body. So you have to make sure that you're prepared,"" Mahomes explained.

While Mahomes is doubling down on his training efforts, he is also building out his business empire.

After signing a record-setting 10-year $503 million contract in 2020, Mahomes purchased a minority stake in the Kansas City Royals. He then invested an undisclosed sum for a stake in surging wearable device company Whoop. The tech unicorn has an estimated valuation of about $1.2 billion.

Those moves come in addition to Mahomes having endorsement deals with athletic-wear maker Adidas, sports recovery device seller Hyperice, NetJets rival Airshare and supplement seller BioSteel.

More recently, Mahomes has dabbled in the exploding NFT market (earlier this month he reportedly sold $3.4 million in NFTs) and attached his name to a SPAC that is on the prowl for tech investments.

""I am trying to build an empire off the field in every way,"" says Mahomes.

Fed officials on the fence about adopting digital US dollar,"The Federal Reserve is continuing its research on the use of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC), but key officials are saying not to expect any Fed-issued digital dollars any time soon.

“That fundamental question of, ‘what are we trying to do with this’ is not clearly answered,” Fed Governor Randal Quarles said in a webinar on Tuesday.

The Fed is working with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to build and test a digital dollar in different hypothetical use cases. But whether or not the Fed ultimately adopts one is a separate question.

Although other central banks have communicated stronger interest in adopting digital versions of their currencies, Fed officials are cautioning that there are many risks associated with launching one.

One issue is privacy. If the Fed uses a blockchain to manage the distribution of digital dollars, users may have concerns about the central bank being able to access and track individual spending data.

Another issue is disrupting the banking system. If the Fed allowed users to pay for goods and services using a Fed-issued digital wallet, banks would be competing with the Fed itself for deposit funding. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said he is open to a ""two-tier"" system where the private sector manages the wallet, not the Fed.

There’s also the concern about whether or not the Fed has the legal authority to issue a digital dollar at all. Powell pledged that he would not launch one without explicit legislation from Congress authorizing the Fed to do so.

“You can expect us to move with great care and transparency in considering a CBDC,” Powell said on March 22.

Why central banks?

Other central banks are moving faster on their own digital currencies, with the European Central Bank already telegraphing the possibility of launching one within four years.

The Fed project is also several years behind the People’s Bank of China, which is already piloting its own digital yuan with users and merchants.

Some central banks see monetary policy benefits to launching digital currencies.

For example, the use of a central bank-issued digital wallet would allow central banks to more directly pass on stimulus to consumers. Instead of “helicopter dropping” money onto the banking system, the Fed could funnel the stimulus straight into consumer wallets.

The ECB and other central banks with negative interest rates could also apply those rates directly to any deposits held in those wallets, more effectively pushing consumers to spend into the economy.

Bank of America Securities expects that central banks will find more benefits in a digital currency than risks.

“We believe CBDCs will become more widespread by the mid-2020s,” BofA Securities wrote Wednesday.

But for the U.S., policymakers are hesitant to disrupt the status quo given the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. Even with the race among other central banks and private players like Facebook’s Diem (formerly Libra), the Fed has said it will not move with haste on the digital dollar project.

“I don’t see an urgent flaw in our system that a central bank digital currency would fix,” Quarles said Tuesday.

God and Man Collide in Bill Hwang’s Dueling Lives on Wall Street,"(Bloomberg) -- With the sun rising outside their conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the visitors to a secretive investment empire bent their heads in prayerful meditation.

It was another Friday morning, 7 o’clock, and a familiar scene was unfolding again inside Archegos Capital Management, an obscure family office that would go on to shake the financial world.

In the days before the pandemic, 20 or 30 people would squeeze together around the long table and, over coffee and Danishes, listen to recordings of the Bible, according to people who were there.

First might come the Old Testament, perhaps Isaiah or Lamentations. Then came the New, the Gospels, which called out to the listeners drawn from a path known more for its earthly greed than its godly faith: Wall Street.

Hitting the play button and then receding into the background was the host, Bill Hwang, the mysterious billionaire trader now at the center of one of the biggest Wall Street fiascos of all time.

The story thus far -- of a mind-boggling fortune made in stealth and then wiped out very publicly in a blink -- has sent shock waves through some of the world’s mightiest banks. Estimates of the potential size of his position before it imploded have spiraled toward $100 billion. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the disaster, which has set teeth on edge in trading rooms across the globe.

But those accounts tell only part of the story. Interviews with people from inside Hwang’s circle, Wall Street players close to him and documents associated with his multimillion-dollar charitable foundation fill in missing puzzle pieces -- ones that haven’t been reported previously.

The picture that emerges is unlike anything Wall Street might suspect.

There are, in a sense, not one but two Bill Hwangs.

Christian Capitalist

One of them walks for hours through New York’s Central Park listening to recordings of the Bible and embraces a new, 21st-century vision of an age-old ideal: that of a modern Christian capitalist, a financial speculator for Christ, who seeks to make money in God’s name and then use it to further the faith. A generous benefactor to a range of unglamorous, mostly conservative Christian causes, this Hwang eschews the trappings of extravagant wealth, rides the bus, flies commercial and lives in what is, by billionaire standards, humble surroundings in suburban New Jersey.

Story continues

Then there’s the other Bill Hwang: a former acolyte of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson with a thirst for risk and a stomach for volatile markets -- a daring trader who once lost a fortune betting against German automaker Volkswagen AG while running a hedge fund that was supposedly focused on Asian stocks.

This is also the Bill Hwang who then went on to quietly become one of the most successful alumni of Robertson’s vaunted Tiger Management. This one masks his dangerous leveraged bets from public view via financial derivatives, was once accused of insider trading and pleaded guilty in 2012 to wire fraud on behalf of his hedge fund, Tiger Asia Management.

That same Bill Hwang, it turns out, is also a backer of one of Wall Street’s hottest hands of late, Cathie Wood of Ark Investments. Like Hwang, Wood is known to hold Bible study meetings and figures into what some refer to as the “faith in finance” movement.

And here, at last, is where the Bill Hwangs collide. The fortune he amassed under the noses of major banks and financial regulators was far bigger and riskier than almost anyone might have thought possible -- and these riches were pulled together with head-snapping speed. In fact, it was perhaps one of the greatest accumulations of private wealth in the history of modern finance.

And Hwang lost it all even faster.

Breakneck Speed

Archegos -- a Greek word often translated as “author” or “captain,” and often considered a reference to Jesus -- was believed by many traders doing business with the firm to be sitting atop $10 billion of assets. That figure, representing Hwang’s personal fortune, was actually closer to $20 billion, according to people who did business with Archegos.

To put that figure in context: Bill Hwang, a name few even on Wall Street had heard until now, was worth more than well-known industry figures like Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen and David Tepper.

Even more remarkable is the breakneck speed at which Hwang’s fortune grew. Archegos started out in 2013 with an estimated $200 million. That’s a sizable fortune but nowhere near big money in the hedge fund game.

Yet within a decade, Hwang’s fortune swelled 100 times over, traders and bankers now estimate. Much of those riches accrued in the past 12 to 24 months alone, as Hwang began to employ more and more leverage to goose his returns, and as banks, eager for his lucrative trading business, eagerly obliged by extending him credit.

Hwang’s success enabled him to endow his own charity, the Grace & Mercy Foundation, which had almost $500 million of assets as of 2018, according to its most recent tax filing.

One institution close to Hwang, and a beneficiary of his foundation, is The King’s College, a small Christian school in the heart of New York’s Financial District.

In a statement to Bloomberg, the college said it was grateful for his generosity and that “our prayers are with Mr. Hwang and his staff.”

McDonald’s Job

The story of both Bill Hwangs begins in South Korea, where he was born Sung Kook Hwang in 1964. The tale he has told friends and associates is a familiar one of immigrant striving -- followed by financial success that few even on Wall Street can fathom.

Hwang grew up in a religious household (like roughly a third of Koreans, his parents were Christian). When he was a teenager, the family moved to Las Vegas, where his father got a job as a pastor at a local church. Hwang has told friends that he arrived in the U.S. unable to speak or write in English and only picked up the language while working nights at McDonald’s. Soon after, his father died and his mother moved the family to Los Angeles. Hwang went on to study economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, and then picked up an MBA at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

Finance beckoned -- and Hwang, it turned out, was very good at it. While a lowly salesman at Hyundai Securities, part of the sprawling Korean chaebol the Hyundai Group, he caught Julian Robertson’s eye. Hwang, not yet 33, was then handed a golden ticket to Wall Street: an offer to join Robertson’s Tiger Management, then at the top of its game.

Hwang quickly distinguished himself by introducing Robertson to the Korean markets -- at the time headed into the teeth of the Asian financial crisis -- and masterminding what turned into a lucrative stake in SK Telecom Co.

Hamptons Lunch

Tiger colleagues say Hwang was one of Robertson’s most successful proteges -- a quiet, methodical analyst with intense focus. Even today, he keeps his desk free of all clutter, the better to focus his mind. Robertson, these people recall, dubbed him “the Michael Jordan of Asian investing.”

Robertson, now 88, still considers Hwang a friend, and the two lunched together in the Hamptons a few months ago.

“He’s not one to be tiny, that’s one thing for sure,” Robertson told Bloomberg after news of the Archegos losses broke.

Hwang would eventually strike out on his own as a so-called Tiger cub. Initially, Hwang shot the lights out, returning an annualized 40% through 2007, when he managed $8 billion.

The hot streak didn’t last. In late 2008, his Tiger Asia incurred stinging losses on a big bet against Volkswagen. Many other hedge funds were shorting the German automaker, too, and when Porsche Automobil Holding SE abruptly announced that it would raise its stake, all hell broke loose. VW soared 348% within 48 hours, crushing shorts like Hwang.

Tiger Asia ended the year down 23%. Many investors pulled their money, angry that a hedge fund that was supposed to be focusing on Asia somehow got caught up in the massive squeeze.

GameStop Frenzy

It was a painful and instructive lesson for Hwang, people who know him say. In the future, he’d hunt out stocks that many traders were shorting and go long instead. Millions of amateur investors took up that approach this year during the social media-fueled frenzy over GameStop and other stocks.

But before the next success, Tiger Asia ran into more trouble -- this time, trouble big enough to bring Hwang’s days as a hedge fund manager to an end.

When Tiger Asia pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2012, the SEC said the firm used inside information to trade in shares of two Chinese banks. Hwang and his firm ended up paying $60 million to settle the criminal and civil charges. The SEC banned him from managing outside money and Hong Kong authorities prohibited him from trading there for four years (the ban ended in 2018).

Shut out of hedge funds, Hwang opened Archegos, a family office. The firm, which recently employed some 50 people, initially occupied space in the Renzo Piano-designed headquarters of the New York Times. Today it’s based further uptown, by Columbus Circle, sharing its address with the Grace & Mercy Foundation.

“My journey really began when I was having a lot of problems in our business about five or six years ago,” Hwang said in a 2017 video. “And I knew one thing, that this was a situation where money and connections couldn’t really help. But somehow I was reminded I had to go to the words of the God.”

That belief helped Hwang rebuild his financial empire at dizzying speed as banks loaned him billions of dollars to ratchet up his bets that unraveled spectacularly as the financial firms panicked. What ensued was one of the greatest margin calls of all time, pushing his giant portfolio into liquidation. Some of the banks may end up with combined losses of as much as $10 billion, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Leveraged Blowout: How Hwang’s Archegos Blindsided Global Banks

As a bruised Wall Street points its collective finger at Hwang, his Christian associates have rallied around him.

Doug Birdsall, honorary co-chairman of the Lausanne Movement, a global group that seeks to mobilize evangelical leaders, said Hwang always likes to think big. When he met with him to discuss a new 30-story building in New York for the American Bible Society, Hwang said, “Why build 30 stories? Build it 66 stories high. There are 66 books in the bible.”

Before so much went so wrong so fast, Archegos appeared to be ramping up. A year ago, Hwang petitioned the SEC to let him work or run a broker-dealer; the SEC agreed.

It’s impossible to say where Bill Hwang, the hard-charging financial speculator, ends, and Bill Hwang, the Christian evangelist and philanthropist, begins. People who know him say the one is inseparable from the other. Despite brushes with regulators, staggering trading losses and the question swirling around his market dealings, they say Hwang often speaks of bridging God and mammon, of bringing Christian teaching to the money-centric world of Wall Street.

”If you know how Bill lives, you will never think this man is worth the kind of money he was,” said John Bai, a finance executive who’s known Hwang for 30 years. “Maybe for some it’s an epic disappearance of wealth, but he’s got God on his side. I am not worried about Bill. He’s not about the money.”

"Seduced by Archegos' growth, Nomura took a chance on Hwang comeback","Seduced by Archegos' growth, Nomura took a chance on Hwang comeback FILE PHOTO: A Nomura logo is pictured at the Japanese company's office in the Manhattan borough of New York City

By Lawrence Delevingne, Matt Scuffham and Sumeet Chatterjee

NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. investor Sung Kook ""Bill"" Hwang was looking for a second chance on Wall Street after falling from grace and shutting his multibillion-dollar hedge fund firm. Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc gave him one.

Nomura had previously had a relationship with Hwang's Tiger Asia Management LLC before the investment firm shut down in 2012 after being punished by U.S. and Hong Kong regulators over insider trading of Chinese stocks.

Like other banks, it initially did not resume the business relationship with the Korean-American investor's new family office, Archegos Capital Management, according to one person familiar with the situation. But Hwang's appetite for huge bets on technology, media and other company stocks in the United States and Asia proved too lucrative to resist.

""It was 'They paid their fines, everything's settled ... they are open for business'"" said a former Nomura employee with knowledge of the revived relationship. ""It was like 'OK ... what are you looking to do?'""

It took time for executives in Tokyo to approve the renewed relationship, in around 2016, the person said. But once they did, Archegos grew to become one of the ten most profitable clients for the bank's U.S. operations, according to the same two people.

A U.S. spokesman for Nomura declined to comment on the relationship with Hwang.

Hwang and Archegos did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of the family office previously said in a statement that ""This is a challenging time for the family office ... our partners and employees.""

The story of how Hwang worked his way back in to Nomura's good graces with the promise of a lucrative trading relationship, details of which are reported here for the first time, underscores the risks Nomura was prepared to take to make headway in the world's most competitive capital market.

Story continues

This story is based on interviews with nearly a dozen people with knowledge of Hwang and Archegos and their relationships on Wall Street, including two people familiar with Nomura's dealings with the fund.

Last week, that relationship was looking like a terrible miscalculation as a plunge in the shares of ViacomCBS Inc left Archegos - which had a highly leveraged bet on the stock - facing a massive margin call from its banks looking to cover the increased exposure.

Those banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which had helped finance Hwang's trades, initially discussed holding off on unwinding them.

But as the shares that underpinned Hwang's positions continued falling, his banks quickly began scrambling to sell off those stocks to try to stem losses.

Two banks - Credit Suisse and Nomura - are facing billions in losses.

NOT ABOUT THE MONEY

Bankers on Wall Street describe Hwang as a down-to-earth and polite person. Married with children, he was not seen indulging in a flashy lifestyle, said Wall Street sources who knew him.

Hwang, who has said he is inspired by his Christian faith, lives in a house in the New York City suburb of Tenafly, New Jersey, with an estimated value of $3.1 million, according to Zillow, where he was photographed this week according to the Daily Mail https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9424195/Bill-Hwang-Billionaire-Archegos-founder-lived-modestly-despite-worth-10billion.html. That is modest compared with many billionaire fund managers.

Hwang did not need to ""buy mega mansions and be on TV,"" said the same source.

“I’m not afraid of death or money. The people on Wall Street wonder about the freedom that I have,"" Hwang said in a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcO5QVVtYiQ posted by his foundation in 2019. ""Ultimately, the most important thing is the Bible.""

That contrasts with Hwang the investor, who was ""super aggressive"" and ""considered a guy who was willing to do incredibly bold things,"" said a professional hedge fund investor who has tracked his career.

Hwang used leveraged to amplify his bets, holding stock positions worth over $50 billion while his funds had assets of about $10 billion, three sources familiar with the trades said.

He did that by buying derivatives known as total return swaps, which allow investors to bet on stock price moves without owning the underlying securities, according to the sources. Instead, the bank buys the stocks and promises the investor a performance-related return. That client, in turn, posts collateral to secure the trades with the bank.

One banker said Hwang's business, producing ""staggering returns,"" was a highly profitable account for banks.

Another of the sources said Hwang would exploit his status as a top client to push banks to reduce their collateral requirements - a key way banks mitigate risks posed by clients.

Competition to win Hwang's business was particularly fierce among banks trying to challenge the dominance of ""top tier"" prime brokers such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

That included Nomura, which currently ranks 23rd on Preqin's global ranking of prime brokers. After deciding to once again deal with Hwang, the Japanese bank rapidly increased its business with him, seeing it as a strategy to win more business from other large U.S. hedge funds.

A bigger market share in the United States is key for the ambitions of Japan’s biggest brokerage to become a global investment bank, a goal fueled by its acquisition of Lehman Brothers' operations in Europe, Asia and the Middle East after the decade-ago financial crisis.

""The relationship really blossomed in the last four to five years as that tied in with (Nomura's) push to get a bigger share of the market in the United States,"" said another person familiar with Nomura and Archegos.

Representatives for Credit Suisse, Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Friday.

BIG BUSINESS, BIG RISK

Archegos' risk-taking was heightened because it had trading relationships with multiple banks. That meant its leverage was amplified on particular stock positions, with exposure on some of Hwang's trades reaching up to 20 times the collateral he had pledged against them, the sources said.

As a family office, Archegos had limited disclosure requirements, so banks may not have been aware of the full extent of how leveraged it was, the source said.

Still, some banks had approached Archegos more cautiously.

Bank of America did not take on Hwang as a client in recent years because of the family office's leverage, concentration in certain securities and Hwang's brush with regulators, according to a person familiar with the bank's thinking.

Compliance executives at Goldman had been wary of Hwang and the bank only agreed to start dealing with him again last year, providing that his positions were highly collateralized, one of the sources said.

As some banks smart from the fire sale, attention is now focusing on whether prime brokers need to step up their due diligence on clients.

Japan's finance minister said on Friday the government is looking into the financial losses incurred by Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and Nomura, and will share information on the matter with the Bank of Japan and overseas authorities.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority have also launched preliminary probes into the Archegos meltdown, according to a different source familiar with the situation. The SEC declined to comment on Friday and the FCA did not immediately respond.

At Nomura, the question of whether the bank fell down on client due diligence is especially acute after it fired risk and compliance professionals in the United States in 2019. One of the sources familiar with matter linked those cuts to risks the bank took with Archegos.

""They probably felt they could manage the risk,"" said the source. ""They were wrong.""

Coinbase Goes Public April 14: What You Need To Know,"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- With the sun rising outside their conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the visitors to a secretive investment empire bent their heads in prayerful meditation.It was another Friday morning, 7 o’clock, and a familiar scene was unfolding again inside Archegos Capital Management, an obscure family office that would go on to shake the financial world.In the days before the pandemic, 20 or 30 people would squeeze together around the long table and, over coffee and Danishes, listen to recordings of the Bible, according to people who were there.First might come the Old Testament, perhaps Isaiah or Lamentations. Then came the New, the Gospels, which called out to the listeners drawn from a path known more for its earthly greed than its godly faith: Wall Street.Hitting the play button and then receding into the background was the host, Bill Hwang, the mysterious billionaire trader now at the center of one of the biggest Wall Street fiascos of all time.The story thus far -- of a mind-boggling fortune made in stealth and then wiped out very publicly in a blink -- has sent shock waves through some of the world’s mightiest banks. Estimates of the potential size of his position before it imploded have spiraled toward $100 billion. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the disaster, which has set teeth on edge in trading rooms across the globe.But those accounts tell only part of the story. Interviews with people from inside Hwang’s circle, Wall Street players close to him and documents associated with his multimillion-dollar charitable foundation fill in missing puzzle pieces -- ones that haven’t been reported previously.The picture that emerges is unlike anything Wall Street might suspect.There are, in a sense, not one but two Bill Hwangs.Christian CapitalistOne of them walks for hours through New York’s Central Park listening to recordings of the Bible and embraces a new, 21st-century vision of an age-old ideal: that of a modern Christian capitalist, a financial speculator for Christ, who seeks to make money in God’s name and then use it to further the faith. A generous benefactor to a range of unglamorous, mostly conservative Christian causes, this Hwang eschews the trappings of extravagant wealth, rides the bus, flies commercial and lives in what is, by billionaire standards, humble surroundings in suburban New Jersey.Then there’s the other Bill Hwang: a former acolyte of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson with a thirst for risk and a stomach for volatile markets -- a daring trader who once lost a fortune betting against German automaker Volkswagen AG while running a hedge fund that was supposedly focused on Asian stocks.This is also the Bill Hwang who then went on to quietly become one of the most successful alumni of Robertson’s vaunted Tiger Management. This one masks his dangerous leveraged bets from public view via financial derivatives, was once accused of insider trading and pleaded guilty in 2012 to wire fraud on behalf of his hedge fund, Tiger Asia Management.That same Bill Hwang, it turns out, is also a backer of one of Wall Street’s hottest hands of late, Cathie Wood of Ark Investments. Like Hwang, Wood is known to hold Bible study meetings and figures into what some refer to as the “faith in finance” movement.And here, at last, is where the Bill Hwangs collide. The fortune he amassed under the noses of major banks and financial regulators was far bigger and riskier than almost anyone might have thought possible -- and these riches were pulled together with head-snapping speed. In fact, it was perhaps one of the greatest accumulations of private wealth in the history of modern finance.And Hwang lost it all even faster.Breakneck SpeedArchegos -- a Greek word often translated as “author” or “captain,” and often considered a reference to Jesus -- was believed by many traders doing business with the firm to be sitting atop $10 billion of assets. That figure, representing Hwang’s personal fortune, was actually closer to $20 billion, according to people who did business with Archegos.To put that figure in context: Bill Hwang, a name few even on Wall Street had heard until now, was worth more than well-known industry figures like Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen and David Tepper.Even more remarkable is the breakneck speed at which Hwang’s fortune grew. Archegos started out in 2013 with an estimated $200 million. That’s a sizable fortune but nowhere near big money in the hedge fund game.Yet within a decade, Hwang’s fortune swelled 100 times over, traders and bankers now estimate. Much of those riches accrued in the past 12 to 24 months alone, as Hwang began to employ more and more leverage to goose his returns, and as banks, eager for his lucrative trading business, eagerly obliged by extending him credit.Hwang’s success enabled him to endow his own charity, the Grace & Mercy Foundation, which had almost $500 million of assets as of 2018, according to its most recent tax filing.One institution close to Hwang, and a beneficiary of his foundation, is The King’s College, a small Christian school in the heart of New York’s Financial District.In a statement to Bloomberg, the college said it was grateful for his generosity and that “our prayers are with Mr. Hwang and his staff.”McDonald’s JobThe story of both Bill Hwangs begins in South Korea, where he was born Sung Kook Hwang in 1964. The tale he has told friends and associates is a familiar one of immigrant striving -- followed by financial success that few even on Wall Street can fathom.Hwang grew up in a religious household (like roughly a third of Koreans, his parents were Christian). When he was a teenager, the family moved to Las Vegas, where his father got a job as a pastor at a local church. Hwang has told friends that he arrived in the U.S. unable to speak or write in English and only picked up the language while working nights at McDonald’s. Soon after, his father died and his mother moved the family to Los Angeles. Hwang went on to study economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, and then picked up an MBA at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.Finance beckoned -- and Hwang, it turned out, was very good at it. While a lowly salesman at Hyundai Securities, part of the sprawling Korean chaebol the Hyundai Group, he caught Julian Robertson’s eye. Hwang, not yet 33, was then handed a golden ticket to Wall Street: an offer to join Robertson’s Tiger Management, then at the top of its game.Hwang quickly distinguished himself by introducing Robertson to the Korean markets -- at the time headed into the teeth of the Asian financial crisis -- and masterminding what turned into a lucrative stake in SK Telecom Co.Hamptons LunchTiger colleagues say Hwang was one of Robertson’s most successful proteges -- a quiet, methodical analyst with intense focus. Even today, he keeps his desk free of all clutter, the better to focus his mind. Robertson, these people recall, dubbed him “the Michael Jordan of Asian investing.”Robertson, now 88, still considers Hwang a friend, and the two lunched together in the Hamptons a few months ago.“He’s not one to be tiny, that’s one thing for sure,” Robertson told Bloomberg after news of the Archegos losses broke.Hwang would eventually strike out on his own as a so-called Tiger cub. Initially, Hwang shot the lights out, returning an annualized 40% through 2007, when he managed $8 billion.The hot streak didn’t last. In late 2008, his Tiger Asia incurred stinging losses on a big bet against Volkswagen. Many other hedge funds were shorting the German automaker, too, and when Porsche Automobil Holding SE abruptly announced that it would raise its stake, all hell broke loose. VW soared 348% within 48 hours, crushing shorts like Hwang.Tiger Asia ended the year down 23%. Many investors pulled their money, angry that a hedge fund that was supposed to be focusing on Asia somehow got caught up in the massive squeeze.GameStop FrenzyIt was a painful and instructive lesson for Hwang, people who know him say. In the future, he’d hunt out stocks that many traders were shorting and go long instead. Millions of amateur investors took up that approach this year during the social media-fueled frenzy over GameStop and other stocks.But before the next success, Tiger Asia ran into more trouble -- this time, trouble big enough to bring Hwang’s days as a hedge fund manager to an end.When Tiger Asia pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2012, the SEC said the firm used inside information to trade in shares of two Chinese banks. Hwang and his firm ended up paying $60 million to settle the criminal and civil charges. The SEC banned him from managing outside money and Hong Kong authorities prohibited him from trading there for four years (the ban ended in 2018).Shut out of hedge funds, Hwang opened Archegos, a family office. The firm, which recently employed some 50 people, initially occupied space in the Renzo Piano-designed headquarters of the New York Times. Today it’s based further uptown, by Columbus Circle, sharing its address with the Grace & Mercy Foundation.“My journey really began when I was having a lot of problems in our business about five or six years ago,” Hwang said in a 2017 video. “And I knew one thing, that this was a situation where money and connections couldn’t really help. But somehow I was reminded I had to go to the words of the God.”That belief helped Hwang rebuild his financial empire at dizzying speed as banks loaned him billions of dollars to ratchet up his bets that unraveled spectacularly as the financial firms panicked. What ensued was one of the greatest margin calls of all time, pushing his giant portfolio into liquidation. Some of the banks may end up with combined losses of as much as $10 billion, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co.Leveraged Blowout: How Hwang’s Archegos Blindsided Global BanksAs a bruised Wall Street points its collective finger at Hwang, his Christian associates have rallied around him.Doug Birdsall, honorary co-chairman of the Lausanne Movement, a global group that seeks to mobilize evangelical leaders, said Hwang always likes to think big.

Biden signed $10B in mortgage help for homeowners. How do you get money?,"Biden signed $10B in mortgage help for homeowners. How do you get money?

The latest COVID relief package signed into law by President Joe Biden sets aside billions for homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments and other bills related to owning a home.

Over 10 million Americans are currently behind on their mortgages and feeling ""housing insecurity,"" according to census data. If you're in that group and have been piling up debt, how do you claim some of the money?

It’s likely to take many months for the funds to get into the hands of those who need it largely because of the way it’s being disbursed, experts warn.

How to qualify for the relief

The recent $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package that's now paying out stimulus checks of up to $1,400 includes nearly $10 billion of direct financial assistance to help homeowners pay not only their mortgages but also taxes, utilities, insurance and homeowners association dues.

The money, formally called the Homeowners Assistance Fund, will be distributed to states based on a formula that takes into account unemployed residents as well as late mortgage payments and foreclosures, says the National Council of State Housing Agencies.

You’re eligible for relief if you own your home and have a loan with a principal balance at or below the conforming loan limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage giants that buy or guarantee most U.S. home loans. The 2021 loan limit in most parts of the U.S. is $548,250.

The money will be funneled to cash-strapped borrowers through state housing agencies. At least 60% of the state grants must go to homeowners with incomes that don't exceed either the local median income or the national median income, whichever is higher.

Getting the money may take time

Russell Graves, executive director of the National Foundation for Debt Management, a multistate housing counseling agency, says he doesn’t expect the funds to be made available until early 2022.

“There are so many other things going through these agencies: rental assistance, different kinds of pandemic assistance,” Graves says. “Frankly, we have never put so much money toward housing in history. The numbers are staggering.”

Story continues

Homeowners need help. The latest U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey shows 7.4% of adults — an estimated 10.1 million people — are not current on their rent or mortgage payments and have ""slight or no confidence"" they'll be able to pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time.

During the wait, forbearance will be key

Graves recommends that homeowners in need call their lenders or servicers — the companies that manage loans and send out statements — to discuss options, including beginning or extending forbearance.

Forbearance allows you to postpone your mortgage payments without getting slammed with late fees or taking a hit to your credit score. (Haven't seen your score in a while? Today, you can easily check your credit score for free.)

Those with federally backed loans — some 70% of the U.S. mortgage population — have been able to apply for forbearance in the pandemic. The deferred payments are typically tacked onto the end of the mortgage term. The enrollment window for forbearance was recently extended and now ends June 30.

If you're in the other 30%, you don’t have the same flexibility, Graves says. He suggests calling a housing counseling agency approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Congress has provided $100 million so those agencies can assist homeowners.

Refinancing may be your remedy

Another possible remedy for overwhelming housing expenses is to refinance your mortgage, if you haven't already done so.

Mortgage rates remain historically low, so the mortgage technology and data provider Black Knight recently reported that 11.1 million homeowners are still in a good position to refinance — and cut their monthly mortgage payments by an average $277.

But you'd have to determine whether you're likely to stay in the home long enough for the savings to more than pay off the new loan's closing costs, which typically run anywhere from 2% to 5% of your loan amount.

If the math wouldn't work, forbearance and Homeowners Assistance Fund money may provide the relief you need.

Hopes for a smooth mortgage aid process

Graves says the closest example to the new mortgage aid program was an Obama-era plan created in response to the Great Recession. The ""Hardest Hit Fund"" was designed to assist the states hit hardest by the subprime lending crisis.

The federal government funneled the funds through each state’s housing agency then, too. But there were challenges.

""It was done by the states in fits and starts. There were a lot of states that got a very slow start and tripped over themselves because this was new,"" Graves says.

He hopes the rollout will be smoother this time: ""Since this is similar, there should be some institutional knowledge in each of these state housing finance agencies so they can take their original programs and tweak them to match the current environment.""

What if you need help immediately?

If your housing expenses are piling up and squeezing your budget, there are some ways you can give yourself some financial breathing room right now, long before any aid comes your way.

If you’ve been using credit cards for most of your purchases during the pandemic and are watching the interest charges escalate, you could replace those pricey balances with a single debt consolidation loan at a lower interest rate.

Or try reducing your homeowners insurance premiums by shopping around for a better dea when your policy comes up for renewal. The same comparison shopping approach works well for saving on car insurance.

The final insult: Some dying of COVID while awaiting vaccine,"After months of hoping to receive a COVID-19 immunization and then weeks of fighting the illness after one never came, Air Force veteran Diane Drewes was down to her last few breaths at a hospice center in Ohio when the phone rang. It was a health care worker, calling to schedule her first appointment for a coronavirus shot.

Drewes’ daughter Laura Brown was stunned by the timing of the call in January but didn’t lash out over the phone or even explain that her 75-year-old mom was at the point of death. There just wasn’t any point, she said.

“But me and my sister were upset that it came too late,” Brown said. “It seemed like the final insult.”

More than 247,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. since vaccines first became available mid-December. Officials had warned that dispensing enough vaccines to reach herd immunity would take months. And with the initial vaccine supply extremely limited and the virus running rampant across the nation over the winter, it was a sad reality that some would contract COVID-19 and die before they could be inoculated.

With surveys showing a large percentage of the U.S. population leery of vaccines, it’s impossible to say exactly how many of the dead would have even wanted an immunization. But Brown said her mother wanted one — desperately. Other families have similar, wrenching stories of loved ones being infected after months of staying safe and then dying before they could get a dose.

Charlotte Crawford, who has spent 40 years working in the microbiology laboratory at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, was fully immunized in January after receiving two doses of the Moderna vaccine because of her work. Yet she then endured the agony of watching her husband and two adult children contract COVID-19 and die before they could get shots.

Henry Royce Crawford, 65, had an appointment for a vaccine when he fell ill, his widow said. Their children, Roycie Crawford, 33, and Natalia Crawford, 38, also wanted the shot but had yet to find one when they got sick and died, Crawford said.

Story continues

The days since their deaths in late February and early March seem like a jumble to Crawford; she is still trying to sort out what happened as she pleads with anyone who will listen to get a vaccine as soon as possible.

“All I know is I did three funerals in three weeks,” said Crawford, of Forney, Texas.

While more than 96 million people in the U.S. have received at least one dose of vaccine, only 53 million are fully vaccinated, or roughly 16% of the nation's population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

With doses now more widely available, shots are proceeding at a quickened pace. More than a dozen states have opened vaccine eligibility to all adults amid an increase in virus cases.

Only the Johnson & Johnson shot is complete after one dose, so the wait time between the first and second shot of either the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines leaves a period of weeks when a recipient remains vulnerable and subject to infection.

The wait for a second shot proved too long for Richard Rasmussen of Las Vegas, said daughter Julie Rasmussen.

Richard Rasmussen, 73, fervently believed in wearing face masks for protection and had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in early January. “He was very excited to get his vaccine,” she said.

Yet Rasmussen tested positive for the virus 10 days later and died Feb. 19 before receiving a second dose, Julie Rasmussen said. His final decline was stunning for its speed, she said.

“And now I am alone,” Rasmussen said in an email interview. “He was my best friend. We texted everyday, all day. I have no siblings. No husband/boyfriend. He was single. I am all alone navigating the legal system and packing his house.""

The same day Rasmussen died, Deidre Love Sullens, of Oklahoma City, was standing in the icy, snow-covered parking lot of a vaccine clinic amid the grief of losing both her mother, Catherine Douglas, 65, and stepfather, Asa Bartlett Douglas, 58, to COVID-19 in a span of 16 days before they could get shots.

“They, and I, looked at the vaccine as the single life-changing factor that would allow us to see one another in person again. It was our goal. We all aimed to get the vaccine so we could gather again, so my mother could play with my daughter again, so we could maybe visit my grandma in the nursing home and not be restricted to window visits,” Sullens said in an interview conducted by email.

On that cold February day, with some doses to spare because foul weather kept others from making appointments, a worker called Sullens in to the clinic to be immunized. Sullens said she was overcome by tears and a “surreal feeling of disbelief"" as she entered.

“My mind was thinking, ‘If only my parents could have held out an extra two months ... they’d be here getting the vaccine too. They’d be alive. They’d be here with me,'"" she said.",
"COVID-19 vaccines may reduce transmission, experts say, but vaccinated Americans still need to wear masks in public. Here's why.","When COVID-19 vaccinations began, U.S. health officials encouraged vaccinated Americans to continue wearing masks in public because scientists were still unsure if they could carry the virus that causes the disease after being inoculated.

Recent results from real-world studies show the COVID-19 vaccines protect against asymptomatic infection, suggesting they also drastically reduce virus transmission.

But health experts still recommend wearing masks in public, regardless of vaccination status, as more research is needed to confirm whether vaccinated people can spread the virus and as variants become more prevalent in the U.S. and states see cases spikes.

The nuanced messages are understandably confusing, especially to pandemic-fatigued Americans eager to return to normal. As hopeful news continues to emerge, health experts urge people to remain vigilant a little while longer.

“Because vaccinations do dramatically reduce transmission, eventually the CDC will issue new (masking) recommendations for vaccinated individuals,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “But it won’t happen until the summer at the earliest, and all this depends on getting the B.1.1.7 variant (first identified in the U.K.) under control and expanding vaccination coverage.”

Preliminary information from Israel found people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine did not develop COVID-19 symptoms or transmit the disease, according to a Pfizer statement released March 11.

“It looks like 90% reduction in asymptomatic transmission. So that’s really good,” Hotez said when the data was made available. Practically speaking, that means the vaccine may enable people to produce antibodies that reduce virus levels in the nose and the mouth, making them less likely to be contagious.

Indoor, small group guidelines: Vaccinated Americans can gather inside without masks or social distancing in certain circumstances, CDC guidelines say

Story continues

In a report published Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines were 90% effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic infection, among front-line essential workers.

Pfizer also released study results Wednesday showing its mRNA vaccine with German partner BioNTech was still more than 90% effective six months after receiving a second dose, even against the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert in infectious diseases, expressed optimism during a White House briefing Friday but added more data is needed to confirm the vaccines' effectiveness on variants.

""So the bottom line message is that vaccines work very well in the real-world setting,"" he said. ""Very, very good reason for everyone to get vaccinated as soon as it becomes available to you.""

While these studies are promising for ending the pandemic, health experts say it's too soon for the nation to ditch masks and return to normal.

Scientists are specifically concerned with how vaccines will stack up against virus variants containing the E484K gene, which may reduce vaccine effectiveness, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

The variants that contain this mutation include the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa, the P.1 variant identified in Brazil and the B.1.526 variant, which may be driving New York’s surge in coronavirus cases.

“They have an advantage, they’re more contagious and by some extent, they resist immunity,” Offit said.

Research has shown non-mRNA vaccines developed by two manufacturers – Johnson & Johnson and Novavax – were still effective, but less so against the B.1.351 variant compared to the original coronavirus strain

In a clinical trial in South Africa, the Novavax vaccine prevented 60% of mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 cases caused by the variant compared to more than 95% of cases caused by the original virus strain, according to a company statement released in January.

And while transmission may be greatly reduced by vaccines, the chances of spreading the virus is not zero, said Michael Mina, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

People should continue to diligently wear their masks, regardless of vaccination status, until cases are low.

“We’ve gone through hell to get to where we are today and the last thing we want to do is keep going through hell,” Mina said. “Wearing masks is still pretty simple … unless you are in a small space with everyone being vaccinated, I would say err on the side of caution for a little bit longer.”

How to Nudge People Into Getting Tested for the Coronavirus,"A person takes a self-administered COVID-19 test at Duke University in Durham, N.C., Feb. 3, 2021. (Pete Kiehart/The New York Times)

In October, Dr. Folasade May, an internist and public health researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, began a new workplace routine. Once a week, she would make the three-minute walk from her office to a campus coronavirus-testing site. After having her temperature checked and scanning a bar code on her phone, she would carefully swab the inside of her nose. Within a day or two, an email would arrive with her results.

Week after week, her results came back negative. She continued to participate in the testing program even after being vaccinated, and she continued to test negative. And then, two weeks ago, an email landed in her inbox that stunned her: Her sample was positive for the coronavirus.

The result — which turned out to be a false positive — briefly threw her life into chaos.

“Our whole family was turned upside down for an afternoon trying to figure out how to separate ourselves in our small house, trying to figure out who’s going to take care of the kids and who else did we expose,” May said.

It is a situation that other families may soon find themselves in as mass coronavirus-screening programs ramp up in schools and workplaces. Some of these programs will make testing mandatory, but many others will rely on voluntary participation — or on people regularly self-administering tests in their own homes.

The more people who participate, the more effective these programs will be at slowing the spread of the virus, and keeping tabs on it. But there are also clear disincentives to participating, ranging from inconvenience to anxiety over the consequences of a positive result, which can mean missing work, keeping a child home from school or days of quarantine.

“There are huge implications of a positive COVID test that a lot of people are very wary of, especially if they’re feeling well,” said May, who studies health disparities and the barriers to accessing health care. “I don’t know that people are going to come out in droves to get it done.”

Story continues

Although coronavirus screening is new, researchers in several fields — including behavioral economics, implementation science and health psychology — have spent years studying how to encourage people to engage in other kinds of health-related behaviors, including cancer screening, HIV testing and vaccination. Some of these same strategies, they say, could help health officials design coronavirus-screening programs, or even vaccination programs, with better participation rates.

“The reality is that people are going to have to wake up and decide whether this is something they intend to do on any given day or any given week,” said Harsha Thirumurthy, associate director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. “And we know — from lots of examples of people’s decisions to seek testing for other health conditions, or even people’s decisions to engage in other health-related behaviors — that people are constantly weighing the costs and benefits of engaging in these services.”

Here are five ways that health officials say can help shift the calculus.

Make It Easy

Humans have a bias toward the status quo, a tendency to want to keep things as they are rather than shake them up. Many studies have shown that people are more likely to engage in various behaviors, from becoming an organ donor to enrolling in a 401(k) plan, when those behaviors are presented as the default choice.

In a randomized clinical trial of nearly 5,000 emergency-room patients, researchers found that the share of patients who were willing to take a rapid HIV test climbed to 66% from 38% when the test was presented as a medical service they had to deliberately decline, rather than one they had to proactively ask for.

Similarly, coronavirus-screening programs are more likely to see wider participation if they are opt-out rather than opt-in. “The more you ask people to put in their own cognitive efforts and behavioral efforts into this, the less likely they’re going to do it,” said Derek Reed, who directs the applied behavioral economics laboratory at the University of Kansas.

And, of course, the actual testing process should be quick and convenient, experts say, with strategically located testing sites and streamlined procedures that allow people to easily incorporate testing into their routines.

Ask People to Plan

Experts also suggested asking people to think through the logistics of when and how they plan to get tested. Studies show that people who clearly formulate a plan for how they intend to accomplish something — whether it’s voting in an upcoming election or getting a flu vaccine — are more likely to follow through.

One possibility, Reed said, would be to text people reminders of their testing appointments, and ask them to reply with, say, a 1 if they plan to walk to the appointment, a 2 if they plan to drive or a 3 if they plan to take the bus. “And then depending on the response, you just automatically ping back Google-map directions or a link to campus or community bus system maps or timetables,” he said.

These kinds of nudges are likely to be most effective for people who are already motivated to get tested but may have trouble following through. “Often you need to nudge them a little bit by just removing frictions to get rid of these small costs,” said Sebastian Linnemayr, a behavioral economist at the RAND Corp., a think tank in California.

Provide (the Right) Incentives

Health officials could also reward people who participate in testing programs. “There probably needs to be some sort of incentive at the patient level,” May said. “We’ve seen the same thing in cancer screening. We’ve seen health insurers provide incentives to patients to participate in healthy lifestyles, to participate in screening measures.”

But the specific incentives matter, and some studies suggest that people are more motivated by an opportunity to win a large reward than the guarantee of a smaller payout.

In a November survey of 200 undergraduate students at the University of Kansas, Reed and his colleagues found that 70% of them said they would be willing to get tested if the university gave them a $5 gift card. But if the university instead entered them in a lottery, in which they had a 5% chance of winning $100, 88% said they would participate, said Reed, who shared his findings with the university.

These kinds of lotteries may be effective because people tend to overestimate their chances of winning them. “The other part of it is that the lottery does introduce an element of fun or engagement in this idea that you’re part of something that other people are also participating in,” Thirumurthy said.

Leverage Social Ties

Peer pressure can be a powerful public health tool; research has shown, for instance, that college women are more willing to get the human papillomavirus vaccine if they believe that their peers are also doing so.

Government, school and workplace leaders can help coronavirus testing become a social norm by making it public how many others are participating. “Then, send out that information over and over again: ‘Don’t be left out: 85% already got tested and are making the school a better place,’” Linnemayr said, adding, “It’s really important that you signal ‘This is an activity that we, as a community, value and reward.’”

Health officials could also consider leveraging social networks more explicitly. In a randomized trial conducted in Kenya, Thirumurthy found that providing women with two HIV self-testing kits and encouraging them to give one to their male partners significantly increased the share of men tested for HIV.

He is now working with colleagues to evaluate a similar program for the coronavirus, asking people to distribute self-testing kits to others in their social circles.

“Who has the strongest ability to persuade you to test?” Thirumurthy said. “Is it going to be your employer or somebody in the community? Or is it going to be someone who is a close friend or a family member?”

Support People Who Test Positive

Even the cleverest nudges, however, will not be enough to persuade people to get tested if they think a positive result will have a devastating effect on their lives. A major barrier to HIV testing has been the fear among potential recipients that testing positive would cost them their friends, jobs, housing or health insurance.

A positive coronavirus test doesn’t necessarily carry the same stigma, but it can still have serious ripple effects on people’s lives. “If it keeps you out of work and you can’t earn an income to support your family, that’s a nonstarter for a lot of people,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.

So governments, employers and community organizations should do what they can to reduce the costs associated with testing positive, health experts said. That could mean providing paid leave or allowing employees to work remotely if they must quarantine; offering hotel vouchers so people have a safe place to isolate; or offering financial and food assistance. Such services can “soften the blow” of testing positive, Thirumurthy said. “There needs to be some type of safety net.”

What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Here are signs of COVID-19,"As the coronavirus outbreak worsens across the U.S., it's important to know what to look out for: How do you know if you’re infected with the new coronavirus? What are the symptoms of COVID-19? And when is it time to see a doctor?

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

Symptoms of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 include a cough, sore throat, aches and pains, fever and fatigue. Some cases are mild, such as the common cold, while others are more likely to lead to pneumonia.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated their list of symptoms to include:

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Chills

Repeated shaking with chills

Muscle pain

Headache

Sore throat

New loss of taste or smell

Nausea and diarrhea

Congestion or a runny nose

Other symptoms reported by doctors include:

Related: How can you stay safe amid the coronavirus crisis? All your burning questions answered.

What are early symptoms of coronavirus?

The CDC believes at this time that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure.

NBC's Dr. Natalie Azar notes that many people have mild symptoms at the beginning and later develop shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The CDC says patients tend to first report fever, muscle aches, cough and sore throat.

What are coronavirus symptoms in children?

Children are less likely to experience serious symptoms with COVID-19. However, some children have developed an inflammatory condition called MIS-C that should receive immediate attention. Symptoms include:

Fever

Rash

Red, swollen hands and feet

Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and abdominal pain

Parents should call a pediatrician or seek help if their child experiences stomach problems and a fever for more than a day.

Story continues

How long do the symptoms of COVID-19 last?

Many people recover within weeks, but for some people called ""long-haulers,"" the symptoms can last for months. Doctors suspect the virus may have a long-term impact on patients' health.

Download the TODAY app for the latest coverage on the coronavirus outbreak.

Can you get reinfected with the coronavirus?

Emerging research suggests that protective antibodies may fade after just a few months. Experts say it's simply too soon to know whether reinfections are happening.

Can you spread coronavirus without having symptoms?

Yes, and this is one of the reasons scientists say it's important to wear a mask. The World Health Organization estimates about 16 percent of people with the coronavirus never develop symptoms, but may indeed be able to spread the virus. Some estimates suggest around 40 percent of transmission may be due to asymptomatic spread.

When should you see a doctor?

Call your doctor or use telemedicine before you visit their office. Don't go straight to a doctor's office or emergency room, where you could unnecessarily expose other people.

Seek medical attention if you have fever, fatigue, cough or shortness of breath and are over the age of 60 or have underlying medical problems, Azar stressed. Anyone with shortness of breath, fever above 104 degrees, chest pain, intractable vomiting or diarrhea should seek medical attention.

What can you expect from a test?

Testing (and the availability of tests) has changed since the beginning of the outbreak. Here's what to know before getting a COVID-19 test.

How is coronavirus treated?

If you are managing symptoms at home, get rest, stay hydrated and take fever reducers like acetominophen or ibuprofen. In the hospitals, doctors will do the same thing but add breathing and oxygen assistance if necessary.

There is currently no vaccine or medicine that we know to be effective against coronavirus COVID-19, though some patients are being enrolled in trials with antivirals.

""Right now, if you test positive but have mild illness you would stay home while being monitored likely by the local or state health department,"" Azar says.

A quarantine for possible exposure would be 14 days.

How can you stay safe if a family member gets COVID-19?

To minimize the risk of transmission, the CDC and the World Health Organization have guidelines for people caring for a loved one with COVID-19. Recommendations include separating the loved one and taking careful precautions.

Is coronavirus worse than the flu?

Both the flu and coronavirus are respiratory illnesses. Coronavirus is definitely more contagious than the flu, Azar said.

""Fever, cough, shortness or breath can apply to both,"" she said. ""With flu, we're very accustomed to this idea of that it starts really quickly, a lot of those aches and malaise.""

If you have flu-like symptoms, ""I think at this point, it's safe to provide guidance to say if you have come into contact with anyone or been to an area where there's an outbreak, you theoretically could have been exposed.""

How does coronavirus spread?

Coronaviruses usually spread through direct contact with an infected person. Researchers are still learning precisely how the new virus spreads from person to person.

Coronaviruses in general are spread through close contact — a range of about 3 to 6 feet — and the virus is primarily spread through a sick person coughing or sneezing on someone.

A person could also become infected through contact with the virus particles on a surface. If an infected person sneezes or coughs onto a surface, such as a countertop or doorknob, and another person touches that surface and then rubs his or her eyes or nose, for example, the latter may get sick.

This novel coronavirus also appears to be spread by talking and breathing. Wearing a mask help stops asymptomatic carriers from transmitting the virus.

How can I protect against coronavirus?

Washing your hands properly is a great place to start. Adhere to social distancing guidelines. Wear a face mask.

Will COVID-19 vaccines work on the new coronavirus variant?,"The New York Times

In October, Dr. Folasade May, an internist and public health researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, began a new workplace routine. Once a week, she would make the three-minute walk from her office to a campus coronavirus-testing site. After having her temperature checked and scanning a bar code on her phone, she would carefully swab the inside of her nose. Within a day or two, an email would arrive with her results. Week after week, her results came back negative. She continued to participate in the testing program even after being vaccinated, and she continued to test negative. And then, two weeks ago, an email landed in her inbox that stunned her: Her sample was positive for the coronavirus. The result — which turned out to be a false positive — briefly threw her life into chaos. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “Our whole family was turned upside down for an afternoon trying to figure out how to separate ourselves in our small house, trying to figure out who’s going to take care of the kids and who else did we expose,” May said. It is a situation that other families may soon find themselves in as mass coronavirus-screening programs ramp up in schools and workplaces. Some of these programs will make testing mandatory, but many others will rely on voluntary participation — or on people regularly self-administering tests in their own homes. The more people who participate, the more effective these programs will be at slowing the spread of the virus, and keeping tabs on it. But there are also clear disincentives to participating, ranging from inconvenience to anxiety over the consequences of a positive result, which can mean missing work, keeping a child home from school or days of quarantine. “There are huge implications of a positive COVID test that a lot of people are very wary of, especially if they’re feeling well,” said May, who studies health disparities and the barriers to accessing health care. “I don’t know that people are going to come out in droves to get it done.” Although coronavirus screening is new, researchers in several fields — including behavioral economics, implementation science and health psychology — have spent years studying how to encourage people to engage in other kinds of health-related behaviors, including cancer screening, HIV testing and vaccination. Some of these same strategies, they say, could help health officials design coronavirus-screening programs, or even vaccination programs, with better participation rates. “The reality is that people are going to have to wake up and decide whether this is something they intend to do on any given day or any given week,” said Harsha Thirumurthy, associate director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. “And we know — from lots of examples of people’s decisions to seek testing for other health conditions, or even people’s decisions to engage in other health-related behaviors — that people are constantly weighing the costs and benefits of engaging in these services.” Here are five ways that health officials say can help shift the calculus. Make It Easy Humans have a bias toward the status quo, a tendency to want to keep things as they are rather than shake them up. Many studies have shown that people are more likely to engage in various behaviors, from becoming an organ donor to enrolling in a 401(k) plan, when those behaviors are presented as the default choice. In a randomized clinical trial of nearly 5,000 emergency-room patients, researchers found that the share of patients who were willing to take a rapid HIV test climbed to 66% from 38% when the test was presented as a medical service they had to deliberately decline, rather than one they had to proactively ask for. Similarly, coronavirus-screening programs are more likely to see wider participation if they are opt-out rather than opt-in. “The more you ask people to put in their own cognitive efforts and behavioral efforts into this, the less likely they’re going to do it,” said Derek Reed, who directs the applied behavioral economics laboratory at the University of Kansas. And, of course, the actual testing process should be quick and convenient, experts say, with strategically located testing sites and streamlined procedures that allow people to easily incorporate testing into their routines. Ask People to Plan Experts also suggested asking people to think through the logistics of when and how they plan to get tested. Studies show that people who clearly formulate a plan for how they intend to accomplish something — whether it’s voting in an upcoming election or getting a flu vaccine — are more likely to follow through. One possibility, Reed said, would be to text people reminders of their testing appointments, and ask them to reply with, say, a 1 if they plan to walk to the appointment, a 2 if they plan to drive or a 3 if they plan to take the bus. “And then depending on the response, you just automatically ping back Google-map directions or a link to campus or community bus system maps or timetables,” he said. These kinds of nudges are likely to be most effective for people who are already motivated to get tested but may have trouble following through. “Often you need to nudge them a little bit by just removing frictions to get rid of these small costs,” said Sebastian Linnemayr, a behavioral economist at the RAND Corp., a think tank in California. Provide (the Right) Incentives Health officials could also reward people who participate in testing programs. “There probably needs to be some sort of incentive at the patient level,” May said. “We’ve seen the same thing in cancer screening. We’ve seen health insurers provide incentives to patients to participate in healthy lifestyles, to participate in screening measures.” But the specific incentives matter, and some studies suggest that people are more motivated by an opportunity to win a large reward than the guarantee of a smaller payout. In a November survey of 200 undergraduate students at the University of Kansas, Reed and his colleagues found that 70% of them said they would be willing to get tested if the university gave them a $5 gift card. But if the university instead entered them in a lottery, in which they had a 5% chance of winning $100, 88% said they would participate, said Reed, who shared his findings with the university. These kinds of lotteries may be effective because people tend to overestimate their chances of winning them. “The other part of it is that the lottery does introduce an element of fun or engagement in this idea that you’re part of something that other people are also participating in,” Thirumurthy said. Leverage Social Ties Peer pressure can be a powerful public health tool; research has shown, for instance, that college women are more willing to get the human papillomavirus vaccine if they believe that their peers are also doing so. Government, school and workplace leaders can help coronavirus testing become a social norm by making it public how many others are participating. “Then, send out that information over and over again: ‘Don’t be left out: 85% already got tested and are making the school a better place,’” Linnemayr said, adding, “It’s really important that you signal ‘This is an activity that we, as a community, value and reward.’” Health officials could also consider leveraging social networks more explicitly. In a randomized trial conducted in Kenya, Thirumurthy found that providing women with two HIV self-testing kits and encouraging them to give one to their male partners significantly increased the share of men tested for HIV. He is now working with colleagues to evaluate a similar program for the coronavirus, asking people to distribute self-testing kits to others in their social circles. “Who has the strongest ability to persuade you to test?” Thirumurthy said. “Is it going to be your employer or somebody in the community? Or is it going to be someone who is a close friend or a family member?” Support People Who Test Positive Even the cleverest nudges, however, will not be enough to persuade people to get tested if they think a positive result will have a devastating effect on their lives. A major barrier to HIV testing has been the fear among potential recipients that testing positive would cost them their friends, jobs, housing or health insurance. A positive coronavirus test doesn’t necessarily carry the same stigma, but it can still have serious ripple effects on people’s lives. “If it keeps you out of work and you can’t earn an income to support your family, that’s a nonstarter for a lot of people,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. So governments, employers and community organizations should do what they can to reduce the costs associated with testing positive, health experts said. That could mean providing paid leave or allowing employees to work remotely if they must quarantine; offering hotel vouchers so people have a safe place to isolate; or offering financial and food assistance. Such services can “soften the blow” of testing positive, Thirumurthy said. “There needs to be some type of safety net.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
Do You Have A Winter Health Issue Or COVID-19? Here's How To Tell.,"Ah, winter ― a time where we find ourselves constantly asking if we’re sick or if it’s just a reaction to the weather and all that comes with it. And during the coronavirus pandemic, those average winter symptoms feel even more alarming.

“As we go into these winter months, symptoms may be due to different things and lines get blurrier,” said Stephanie Christenson, a pulmonologist and assistant professor in the division of pulmonary, critical care, allergy and sleep medicine at the University of San Francisco. “But we’re also seeing surges in COVID-19 all over the country, so there’s a greater chance of getting infected. Being as diligent as possible is so incredibly important.”

To clear up confusion about whether your symptoms should raise a red flag for COVID-19, we asked experts to share other potential causes of coronavirus-like symptoms. Here’s what to look out for and advice on how to stay safe this winter.

Breathing cold, dry air

Dry air and freezing temperatures can dry out your airway — which includes the nasal passage and part of the throat — and cause discomfort, producing a cough, runny nose or nasal congestion. Wintry air can also compromise the moist protective lining in your airway, added David Serota, an infectious disease physician in Miami.

“When these areas dry out, viruses and bacteria are better able to latch on and develop an infection,” Serota said.

Christenson said to monitor a cough, runny nose, sore throat or nasal congestion that may occur after breathing cold air outdoors. If it is solely due to the cold air, these symptoms should resolve after a day or two.

Indoor and outdoor allergens

As we stay indoors more to escape the cold, we face extended exposure to allergens such as dust mites, mold, pet dander and more, said Gerald Lee, an allergist and immunologist in Atlanta.

Dust mites are commonly found in beds or circulating through your home’s heating and cooling system. Humid or damp areas like trash cans, kitchens or bathrooms can harbor mold, as can a fresh Christmas tree and leaves or soil in your garden. Some places have trees that pollinate in the winter months, so those allergic to pollen can continue to experience symptoms, Lee said.

Story continues

Even for people who do not have allergies, some are sensitive to wood smoke and fragrances from candles and other indoor perfumes.

“Most of the respiratory symptoms — like nasal drainage, cough, potentially sore throat, potentially sinus issues and headaches associated with sinus issues — could be seen in an allergy or COVID-19,” Lee said. If you have an itchy nose or itchy eyes, this is more likely an allergic reaction.

Lee pointed out that sometimes allergy-related sinus issues can decrease your sense of taste or smell, but it’s not stark or sudden — unlike losing taste or smell due to COVID-19. The loss of taste or smell experienced by COVID-19 patients usually feels highly unusual to them.

Ultimately, if you’re unsure whether your symptoms are from allergies or a virus, Lee encouraged seeking clarification from a doctor.

Exposure to other viruses

When people congregate indoors where ventilation is poorer in the winter, they are more likely to experience respiratory infections caused by influenza, rhinoviruses and other coronaviruses that are not COVID-19.

While there are symptoms unique to a COVID-19 infection ― like stark changes in taste and smell, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea ― symptoms of these other viral infections mimic many symptoms of COVID-19, such as a sore throat, cough, fever, fatigue and body aches.

Christenson’s advice? If you feel like you have a flu or infection coming on, don’t wait around to speculate and get tested as soon as possible. And remember that a negative test result shouldn’t be a sign to end isolation, especially if you still have symptoms.

“Because the tests are not 100% sensitive ― meaning false negatives are possible ― if someone has symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and no other explanation, it is reasonable to isolate and follow the recommendations for return-to-work based on people with diagnosed COVID-19,” Serota added.

Isolating keeps any possible viral infection from spreading further to loved ones and the community, and protects you from worsening your current state.

Flare up of chronic lung conditions

Viruses are the most common trigger of symptoms of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among other triggers like wood smoke, strong fragrances or chemical smells, Christenson explained.

If you have asthma or COPD, you are probably keenly aware of what your usual cough or other respiratory symptoms are like in winter. Anything that feels different or any increase in your usual respiratory symptoms should prompt you to isolate and inform your doctor, Christenson said.

“It could be very difficult for a patient to tell the difference between COVID-19 and an exacerbation of their asthma or COPD due to causes other than the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” she said.

Christenson advised isolating until symptoms are at least improving. “Sometimes for asthma or COPD patients, it may take weeks to months to really get all the way back to baseline. But, it would be best to try to isolate until you are clearly on the mend.”

How can you minimize the effects of these winter-related health issues

There are a few measures you can take to lessen the confusion between COVID-19 and normal winter health woes.

Christenson stressed the importance of covering your nose and mouth with a mask while outdoors. In addition to mask wearing, minimizing contact with other people and physical distancing would decrease your chances of catching the other viral infections. Serota also urged getting a flu shot and continuing to wash your hands and practice good health hygiene.

Christenson encouraged people with asthma or COPD to follow their doctor’s advice on how to manage it: taking inhalers or medications as prescribed, covering your nose and mouth when outdoors, dressing warmly and avoiding symptom triggers.

Take appropriate steps to manage any allergies as well. Place a dust mite cover over your mattress and wash bedding once a week to minimize dust mite exposure. Keep pets away from areas you spend a lot of time in, and consider installing high efficiency furnace filters with a high allergen rating.

Lee suggested over-the-counter medications like intranasal corticosteroids or second generation oral antihistamines if it’s difficult for you to avoid an allergen. Consult with an allergist to help you determine the best option.

Finally, if you’re ever in doubt about your symptoms: Stay home and call your doctor. Encourage your loved ones to do the same. It’s not worth the risk of spreading illness ― especially right now.

Everything We Know About COVID-19's Impact On The Brain

Do You Need The Coronavirus Vaccine If You Already Had COVID-19?

The 7 Most Common Places COVID-19 Is Spreading Right Now

What To Know About Allergic Reactions To The COVID-19 Vaccine,"The arrival of coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna has offered a much-needed dose of optimism in an otherwise grueling pandemic. But many people have questions after reports of some instances of allergic reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which was granted emergency authorization use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this month.

Some people who were administered the vaccine reportedly experienced anaphylaxis or a less severe allergic reaction, which was not seen in the vaccine trials.

The FDA is investigating the cases of allergic reactions, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that anyone who had a severe reaction (which is defined as needing the medication epinephrine or treatment in a hospital) should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

So, does this mean we be super concerned? Here’s everything you need to know right now about the vaccine and any allergic reactions that may come up:

The percentage of people who have actually experienced an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine is low.

The FDA is looking into about five cases of allergic reactions reported in people who received the first dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine. The cases occurred in several parts of the country.

This is concerning, yes. However, when you compare the number of these cases to the total number of people vaccinated so far ― roughly at least 128,000, or even more when you count the people who participated in the trials ― the percentage of people experiencing this issue is pretty small.

“With large numbers of people being vaccinated, reports of allergic reactions are very rare and have been easily treated with resolution,” Daniel Griffin, chief of infectious disease at ProHEALTH Care and national process expert for Optum Vaccine Administration, told HuffPost.

Most people, including those with specific allergies, shouldn’t be too stressed out about the vaccine right now, Griffin said.

“Only people with a severe reaction to a prior vaccination should be concerned, and we recommend they discuss this with a doctor prior to vaccination,” he said. “People with other allergies, such as to food, pollen or even antibiotics, need not worry.”

Story continues

It’s not clear if Moderna’s vaccine will cause the same issue.

Kavita Patel, HuffPost medical contributor and a practicing internal medicine physician in Washington, D.C., said in a recent HuffPost Q&A that Moderna’s data from the vaccine trials submitted to the FDA showed no severe allergic reactions.

That said, this isn’t a guarantee that no one will experience a reaction if they get the Moderna vaccine ― which was also just granted emergency authorization use by the FDA ― rather than the Pfizer vaccine. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a recent press conference that a chemical used in both vaccines, called polyethylene glycol, could be what’s causing the reactions, Reuters reported.

Griffin said experts will know more once a greater number of people are vaccinated. As of now, the FDA is advising that the Moderna vaccine should not be given to people with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any components of the immunization.

Most vaccines cause allergic reactions in some people.

Allergic reactions like this aren’t unique to the COVID-19 vaccines. Overall, this news shouldn’t cause extreme vaccine hesitancy or alarm for the general public.

“Most vaccines cause allergic reactions in a few people, so there is nothing new with the COVID vaccines,” Griffin said. “These reactions appear rare, and may be even less common with the COVID vaccines than other vaccines.”

If you’ve experienced an allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past, talk to your doctor before you get a COVID vaccine.

We still have a long way to go before a COVID-19 vaccine is available to most people, so this won’t really even be an issue for quite some time. When it’s your turn to get the shots, talk to your doctor about your specific case, including your known allergies and any history you might have of vaccine reactions.

“If you have had a serious reaction to prior vaccines, you might not be able to receive the vaccine, or at a minimum might need to discuss the reaction with your provider and determine if it’s still reasonable to get it,” Patel said.

Griffin said some patients with a history of vaccine reactions “may be advised to take an antihistamine such as Benadryl 30 minutes prior to vaccination.” Your physician may also monitor you for an additional 30 minutes after you get your dose, to make sure you’re OK.

And remember, there are other ways to protect yourself from COVID-19 in the meantime: Wear a mask, wash your hands and keep your distance from people who aren’t in your household. We’ll likely have to continue these measures for some time anyway, even with an available vaccine.

Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most up-to-date recommendations.

Are travel bans effective against the coronavirus variant?,"A newly identified variant of the coronavirus has led over 40 countries to impose travel restrictions against the United Kingdom, which registered a record number of daily cases on Tuesday.

“The spread is being driven by the new variant of the virus,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said over the weekend, announcing tighter restrictions ahead of the Christmas holiday. “It appears to spread more easily and may be up to 70 percent more transmissible than the earlier strain.”

Much is still unknown about the coronavirus variant found in the United Kingdom, and such mutations are common among viruses as they move through populations. The new strain is being called SARS-CoV-2 VUI-202012/01 (“Variant Under Investigation”) and could potentially be more contagious. It’s unclear if it is deadlier.

The U.S. is not among the 40 countries with the new U.K. restrictions. The nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told CNN this week that the plan would be to “follow it carefully, but don’t overreact to it.” Adm. Brett Giroir, the Trump administration’s assistant secretary for health, similarly said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not made any recommendation to ban travel from Britain. “We just need to put everything on the table, have an open scientific discussion and make a best recommendation,” he said.

Are travel bans and restrictions even effective against the coronavirus?

Yahoo News Medical Contributor Dr. Kavita Patel says, “Travel bans in general can be effective as a very blunt mechanism. And certainly we saw travel bans very broadly in the earlier part of this year, but that’s really a way to try to limit the virus to one geography.” While the U.S. began implementing travel restrictions against China on Feb. 2, it wasn’t until March 13 that travel restrictions against Europe were put in place. By then, Italy had more than 15,000 known cases and at least 1,000 deaths from the virus.

“We have learned from looking backwards that there are European strains that have been responsible for some of the hot spots, particularly in New York at the beginning of the pandemic, but we have no proof that the U.K.’s strain under investigation is present in the United States,” Patel says.

Story continues

But New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he doesn’t want history to repeat itself with this new virus strain. “The coronavirus got on a plane in China and went to Europe and came here from Europe, and nobody said anything for two months in the federal government. And it had been coming for so long that it was then too late,” Cuomo said at a press conference this week.

He called on the federal government to ground flights from the U.K. to help prevent the new coronavirus variant from spreading. Cuomo also called on British Airways, Delta and Virgin Atlantic to add New York state to the list of 120 countries that require passengers to produce a negative COVID-19 test before departure from the U.K. All three airlines had agreed to his request by the end of the day.

But Patel says this form of testing has limitations. “Testing tells you just for that very particular moment if you have SARS-CoV-2 and could have COVID-19. But we know that you could easily have a negative test, board a plane, and then come off the plane and be positive hours later, but get passed through customs, pass through security,” she says.

And Patel says one state alone can only do so much against a highly infectious virus. “It’s hard to really isolate one state in particular; you really do need cooperation from the states that people travel to, and especially in a state like New York, we already know that there is incredible travel across Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, for example. And it would be more ideal to have those governors kind of working in a bloc together.”

Cuomo pointed out the same limitations unless the whole country is on board with the travel restrictions. “Otherwise, you’ll just have people fly into Chicago or somewhere else and get on a plane and fly to New York,” he told MSNBC. “You can’t control this virus state by state; we’re one nation, it’s impossible.”

Am I immune to the coronavirus if I’ve already had it?,"Am I immune to the coronavirus if I’ve already had it?

You have some immunity, but how much and for how long are big unanswered questions.

There’s evidence that reinfection is unlikely for at least three months even for people who had a mild case of COVID-19. That’s how long New York City researchers found stable levels of protective antibodies in a study of nearly 20,000 patients of the Mount Sinai Health System.

Reinfection so far has been rare. The best known example: Researchers in Hong Kong said a man had mild COVID-19 and then months later was infected again but showed no symptoms. His second infection was detected through airport testing, and researchers said genetic tests revealed slightly different strains of the virus.

It’s actually evidence the man’s immune system worked like it should. Very few diseases leave people completely immune for life.

Antibodies are only one piece of the body’s defenses, and they naturally wane over time. And usually, “memory” immune cells can identify germs they previously encountered so they’re better at fighting them the second time around. That can help make any repeat infections less severe.

Scientists are studying how the other parts of the immune system kick in with the coronavirus.

It’s not known whether people who’ve been reinfected but show no symptoms would be able to spread the virus to others. That’s why health authorities say even people who have recovered from COVID-19 need to wear a mask, keep their distance and practice good hygiene.

As the world braces for the continued spread of the coronavirus, rarely-before used terms like “pandemic,” “incubation period” and “quarantine” have solidified their place in our global conversation. Understanding these words — which are now ubiquitous on social media and in daily conversations — is crucial. But if the strange new vocabulary is making your head spin, you’re not alone. Here to help is a simple-to-use glossary of the words you need to know.

A

Antibodies

Specific proteins created by the immune system to fight off an infection.

Antibody test

A blood test used to locate specific antibodies that determine whether or not an individual has been exposed to a virus.

Brazil battling COVID-19 as country faces record death numbers,"The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime.

It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing.

Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch.

Myanmar death toll mounts as crackdown on anti-coup protests intensifies,"The Guardian

The fact that this guy is a sitting member of Congress shows just how low we set the bar for our (male) politicians Matt Gaetz: a man who has spent his career reveling in scandal rather than actually doing his job. Photograph: Michael Brochstein/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock A guide to navigating ‘Gaetzgate’ The Matt Gaetz story increasingly reads like a script written by a pervert high on a cocktail of ADHD meds and MDMA. Even if you’ve been following the scandal-prone Republican congressman’s latest controversy closely it’s hard to keep track of what on earth is happening. So here’s a guide to navigating the saga far. First and foremost, it has been established that Gaetz is under federal investigation for sexual misconduct. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the justice department (DoJ) is investigating whether Gaetz, 38, “had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her to travel with him”. If these allegations are accurate, then Gaetz could have violated federal sex trafficking laws. According to the Times, the allegations are part of a broader investigation into a political ally of Gaetz’s named Joel Greenberg, a Florida tax collector who was indicted last year on charges including the sex trafficking of a child. Greenberg also reportedly misused public funds to buy servers for a cryptocurrency company as well as weapons, ammunition and a drone. As you do. After the Times broke the story, Gaetz confirmed to Axios that he was under federal investigation for sexual misconduct and is worried about being criminally charged. Rather predictably, however, he insists that he’s actually the victim in all of this and has said “no part of the allegations” against him are true. Gaetz, who is currently engaged to a woman 12 years younger than him, claimed that he used to be a “generous” partner in his single days and paid for flights and hotel rooms. “I think someone is trying to make that look criminal when it is not,” he said. Why would someone want to do that? Well, in a statement released on Tuesday Gaetz said he and his family have “been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DoJ official seeking $25m while threatening to smear my name”. He claims the investigation is a cover for extortion and suggested that it was linked to the “Biden White House”. Which is a weird claim considering the New York Times reports that the investigation into Gaetz, a Donald Trump loyalist, was opened in the final months of the Trump administration under then attorney general William Barr. Here’s where things get really weird. According to the Washington Post, a couple of grifters who learned of the investigation against Gaetz decided to use the opportunity to extort the congressman’s father. They reportedly wrote to Don Gaetz and said that there were pictures of his son with “child prostitutes”; they would help Gaetz, however, if he gave them a large sum of money. The idea, dubbed “Project Homecoming”, was that they’d use that money to locate and rescue Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who was kidnapped in Iran back in 2007. Levinson, who is presumed dead, would be heroically rescued by Gaetz; Joe Biden would be so thrilled with the rescue that he’d pardon Gaetz. The bottom line? It seems plausible that Gaetz really is caught up in a bizarre extortion plot. However, there are two possible scenarios here. Scenario one: Gaetz did nothing wrong and is telling the truth about being the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy orchestrated by his political rivals that kicked off when Gaetz’s buddy Trump was in power. Scenario two: there is no big conspiracy against the congressman; a couple of opportunists simply pounced on the investigation against him as a way to make money. I don’t know about you but the second scenario seems rather more plausible to me. Ultimately, it’s important not to let all the drama distract from the real issue here, which is that a sitting congressman seems to be under investigation for sex trafficking and has links to a guy who has already been indicted for sex trafficking. It doesn’t really look good for Gaetz. It looks so bad, in fact, that Gaetz’s communications officer abruptly left his job on Friday. While the allegations against Gaetz are still being investigated, it’s worth noting that Gaetz has faced accusations of disturbing sexual conduct before. In January 2020 Chris Latvala, a Republican congressman, tweeted that Gaetz “created a game where members of the FL House got ‘points’ for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists, and married legislators”. Gaetz also reportedly bragged of his sexual exploits and showed other lawmakers nude photos of women he’d slept with. According to CNN, he showed his colleagues these photos while he was at work. Gaetz, by the way, was also the only lawmaker to vote against a bipartisan anti human-trafficking bill. A number of his colleagues have also spoken out about “love of alcohol and illegal drugs, as well as his proclivity for younger women”. I don’t know exactly what Gaetz has or hasn’t done, but I do know he’s spent his career reveling in scandal rather than actually doing his job. He even joked with Elon Musk last week about how a scandal involving him would be called GaetzGate. The fact that this guy is a sitting member of Congress boggles the mind. It shows just how low we set the bar for our (male) politicians. Boy, do I ever regret giving Gaetz the benefit of the doubt I should state for the record that I wrote an article last year saying I thought it was unfair that people were insinuating Gaetz had an inappropriate relationship with his t “son”, Nestor. And there is no evidence, to be clear, that the relationship is inappropriate. However I have certainly learned my lesson: never ever even vaguely defend Matt Gaetz. The rise of granfluencers Two octogenarians went viral after modelling their grandson’s gender-neutral fashion line at Paris fashion week. They’re part of a growing trend of “granfluencers”. Ivanka’s women’s empowerment scheme not very empowering after all The Government Accountability Office has issued a very unflattering report about Ivanka Trump’s women’s empowerment initiative. I am you are just as shocked about this as I am. How Lady Mary Wortley Montagu’s bold experiment led to smallpox vaccine Edward Jennner gets the credit for inventing the smallpox vaccine in 1796. Turns out he was building on a woman’s work: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had successfully inculcated her three-year-old daughter several decades before Jenner’s experiments. Of course, she got zero credit for her ideas at the time and was denounced as an “ignorant woman”. Andrew Cuomo is fighting to erect a skyscraper called Penn15 in Manhattan I wish this was a joke but it’s not. The New York governor is facing a number of scandals but refuses to resign and is reportedly obsessed with this real estate project. Perhaps because the people behind it have given a lot of money to his campaigns. The week in pawtriarchy The only person who might be worse at their job than Cuomo is the genius who reportedly tried to pass off a golden retriever as a lion at a Chinese zoo. The zookeeper may have been inspired by an incident a few weeks earlier at another zoo in China where a supposed wolf’s cage housed a rottweiler. Which might be funny were it not for the fact that many Chinese zoos are notoriously cruel.",
Thousands rally in England and Wales over police legislation,"LONDON (AP) — Hundreds of people marched Saturday through central London and other cities across England and Wales to protest the British government's plan to hand the police new powers to tackle demonstrations.

Protesters walked past Buckingham Palace towards Parliament Square, just outside the Houses of Parliament. A ring of officers positioned themselves around the statue of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill in Parliament Square. The statue had been defaced during anti-racism protests last year.

Protesters, including many who carried anti-sexism placards and chanted “Women scared everywhere, police and government do not care!” passed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office at 10 Downing Street.

London's Metropolitan Police said the majority of people “have tried to adhere to social distancing"" but that a ”small minority"" had blocked the road at Parliament Square.

“Officers are on scene engaging and encouraging them to move so we can reopen the roads,” it said.

The protests were taking place over the long Easter holiday weekend, including in the Welsh capital of Cardiff and in the northern England cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle.

The demonstrators were upset at the Conservative government’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which is currently going through parliament. Under the terms of the bill, which covers England and Wales, police will be able to ban or shut down protests.

A recent protest against the new legislation in Bristol, southwest England, descended into widespread violence that saw police officers injured, a police station damaged and police vehicles torched.

Separately, 27 police officers were injured during riots in Northern Ireland on Friday evening and eight people were arrested. The reasons behind the unrest were unclear.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland said 15 officers were injured in Belfast after being targeted by a crowd of mainly young people, throwing stones, fireworks, flares, manhole covers and petrol bombs. It said 12 more police were injured in Londonderry after young adults threw stones, bottles, petrol bombs and fireworks.

Political leaders called for calm over the long Easter weekend. Northern Ireland's first minister, Arlene Foster, urged young people “not to get drawn into disorder.""",

On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on.

Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A U.S. Capitol Police officer identified as William Evans, an 18-year veteran of the force, was killed in an attack at the Capitol building Friday afternoon. A second officer was injured, but is reportedly in stable condition. Shortly after 1 p.m., the suspect, identified as 25-year-old Indiana man Noah Green, rammed his car into two officers before hitting a barricade, Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said. The suspect then exited the vehicle with a knife and lunged at an officer. An officer then shot the suspect, who died at a hospital. The suspect was not on the radar of Capitol Police, and no motive is known. Lawmakers were not in the building, as Congress is in recess. [NBC News]

The first week of the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin wrapped up Friday with a testimony from Minneapolis' most senior officer, Lt. Richard Zimmerman, who said Chauvin's use of force in his arrest of George Floyd was ""totally unnecessary,"" without mentioning him by name. ""I saw no reason why the officers felt they were in danger, if that's what they felt, and that's what they would have to have felt to have to use that kind of force,"" Zimmerman said. He noted the restraint on Floyd should ""absolutely"" have stopped once he was handcuffed and on the ground, per department policy, The Star Tribune reports. [The Star Tribune]

Major League Baseball is moving this season's All-Star Game and MLB Draft from Atlanta in protest of a new Georgia voting law. The announcement comes one week after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed into law a new measure to restrict voting access in the state. In a statement, MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred said moving the game is the best way to demonstrate the sport's values. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" Manfred said. A new host city is in the works. In response to the decision, former President Donald Trump called for a boycott of MLB. [MLB, The Week]

The U.S. economy added 916,000 jobs in March, The Labor Department announced Friday, blowing past the 675,000 jobs economists had predicted. The unemployment rate fell from 6.2 percent to 6 percent. The trend continues from last month's report, in which 379,000 jobs were added, also exceeding expectations. ""Job growth was widespread in March, led by gains in leisure and hospitality, public and private education, and construction,"" the Labor Department said. The news comes as vaccination availability increases, temperatures rise, and states continue to reopen. As these trends continue, economists predict even faster hiring. [CNBC, MarketWatch]

The Suez Canal Authority announced Saturday that all 422 ships stranded by the previously grounded Ever Given have passed through the canal, ending the backlog caused by the container ship getting stuck horizontally in March. The massive vessel was eventually dislodged Monday after rescue teams worked for almost a week to refloat it. The canal plays a crucial role in global trade, and the incident, Al Jazeera notes, threw international supply chains into disarray. The SCA is now investigating what caused the Ever Given to run aground. Results from the inquiry will reportedly be revealed within the next two days. [BBC, Al jazeera]

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday gave people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 the green light to travel within the U.S. without getting tested or self-quarantining. They should, however, still wear a mask in public areas, avoid crowds, and practice personal hygiene. The rules for those who are partially vaccinated or not vaccinated have not changed. The new guidelines are based on studies of ""real-world'' effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. The CDC estimates nearly 17 percent of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, meaning they are two weeks out from their final dose of an FDA-approved vaccine. [CDC]

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Friday announced an executive order prohibiting government entities in the state from issuing COVID-19 vaccine ""passports"" or ""other standardized documentation for the purpose of certifying an individual's COVID-19 status to a third party."" Vaccinations are private information, DeSantis argued, adding that he believes ""vaccine passports reduce individual freedom and harm privacy."" The order, effective immediately, also bans private businesses from requiring patrons to provide documentation certifying either COVID-19 vaccination or prior coronavirus infection. ""It's completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply participate in normal society,"" DeSantis said. He said Florida's legislature is working on making the ban permanent. [The Guardian, NBC News]

A Taiwanese construction site manager whose truck rolled down a hill and collided with a train on Friday appeared in court Saturday, The South China Morning Post reports. The accident killed 50 passengers and crew and injured nearly 180 others, reportedly making it Taiwan's worst rail disaster in seventy years. The train struck the unmanned truck, causing the first two carriages to derail outside a tunnel near the city of Hualien. The Taiwan Safety Board launched an investigation into the accident, and investigators are reportedly trying to determine whether the truck's brakes had been properly applied or if there was a mechanical failure. The construction site manager was questioned by police before being sent to the Hualien prosecutor's office. A court granted him bail, but the prosecutor will reportedly seek to appeal.

The Arizona women's basketball team stunned Connecticut on Friday night to advance to the school's first ever national championship game, where they'll play Pac-12 rival and the tournament's top overall seed, Stanford, on Sunday night. The No. 3 Wildcats were underdogs against UConn, the sport's premier program, but they controlled the game from the start en route to a 69-59 win. In fact, the Huskies never led. Arizona's senior guard Aari McDonald, who has been one of the stars of the tournament, led the way with 26 points. Stanford, meanwhile, pulled out a 66-65 nail-biter against South Carolina earlier in the evening. The Gamecocks missed two shots in the final seconds, and the Cardinal escaped.

Gaetz sex probe suddenly threatens a speedy Washington rise,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Compared with most congressional newbies, it didn't take Rep. Matt Gaetz long. Phone calls from the president. Rides aboard Air Force One. Hundreds of television appearances. A darling in conservative circles.

Yet barely four years after arriving in Washington as a little-known Republican state legislator from Florida’s Panhandle, the 38-year-old unblushing defender of Donald Trump is facing a possible abrupt end to his once promising career because of a federal sex-trafficking investigation.

The overwhelming reaction of Gaetz's GOP colleagues — a deafening silence. That reflects the resentments he's sparked during his breakneck rise as one of the party's celebrities and the challenge he faces to retain his seat.

Government agents are investigating if Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old and other underage girls and violated federal sex trafficking laws, people familiar with the probe have told the AP. No charges have been filed, and Gaetz has denied the allegations.

But with new, damaging details emerging regularly, Gaetz's political arc is beginning to resemble the myth of Icarus, who plunged to earth after ignoring warnings that his waxen wings would melt if he flew too close to the sun.

The coming days will test the crisis management skills of one of the most visible members of Congress' younger generation, who critics say care more about promoting their own brand than serious legislating.

“They're here for notoriety and to perform to their base, and anything else that may come is secondary,” said Doug Heye, a Trump critic and former top GOP congressional aide. “And if you boo him that's great too, as long as you're watching.”

David Bossie, president of Citizens United, which backs conservative causes and candidates, countered that Gaetz ""has been a conservative warrior, working every day to make America great again and fight for President Trump’s agenda.”

Gaetz's congressional Twitter account is topped with a photo of himself taking a selfie with Trump, apparently on Air Force One. On his personal Twitter account, Gaetz describes himself as “Florida man. Fiancé. Firebrand. America First."" He became engaged at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in December.

Story continues

Gaetz is quick with a quote and looks little older than a college student. And by his own account, he's hardly led a prudish lifestyle while battling for conservative causes.

In his 2020 autobiographical book, “Firebrand,” Gaetz praised Trump as someone “who doesn’t care for puritanical grandstanding or moralistic preening."" He added, ""If politicians’ family lives aren’t what really matter to the voters, maybe that’s a good thing. I’m a representative, not a monk.”

Chris Latvala, a former GOP colleague in the Florida legislature, suggests that while there, Gaetz went too far. On Friday, Latvala revived a 2020 tweet in which he accused Gaetz of creating a “game where members of the FL House got 'points' for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists, and married legislators.”

Latvala wrote Friday, “ I am just sorry that this guy may have victimized others, including possibly minors before others came forward to verify it.”

The game was also described by two other Florida Republicans, who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal what was a private matter. Gaetz has denied knowing about it.

The son of Don Gaetz, a wealthy businessman and one-time Florida state Senate president, Matt Gaetz came to Congress after six years of building his conservative credentials in the state House with pro-gun and other legislation.

Just months after Gaetz arrived in Washington in 2017, when Trump's presidency also began, special counsel Robert Mueller began investigating Russia's influence in Trump's election.

Gaetz sprang into action to defend Trump, filing one resolution asserting investigative wrongdoing aimed at making Mueller resign, and essentially never stopped. His persistence was noted by Trump, who began calling the young lawmaker.

The day before a House hearing on the Russia investigation in 2019, Gaetz tweeted at former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who'd turned on Trump and was about to testify, asking, “Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends?"" The House Ethics Committee formally admonished Gaetz for the tweet, which some saw as an attempt at intimidation, and he apologized.

Gaetz was highly visible again months later when the House began its impeachment investigation over Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to provide political dirt on Democrat Joe Biden, who would eventually defeat Trump in the election.

Most notably, Gaetz led a cluster of House Republicans who barged past Capitol Police officers into a secure basement meeting room where House Intelligence Committee members were questioning witnesses. They caused a delay of several hours that had little impact on the probe but garnered press attention.

Gaetz was grabbing the spotlight in other ways, too. He brought a white nationalist who questioned the Holocaust as his guest to Trump's 2018 State of the Union address, later claiming ignorance of the man's views.

In March 2020 as the pandemic was taking hold, Gaetz wore a gas mask on the House floor. Critics accused him of downplaying COVID-19, as Trump repeatedly did, but Gaetz asserted he was calling attention to lawmakers' vulnerability to the disease.

All the while, his visibility was growing. Gaetz has made 346 weekday cable news appearances since August 2017, according to Media Matters, a liberal group that monitors conservative media activity.

That makes Gaetz second in Congress only to Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a fellow Trump ally and ubiquitous TV presence.

Through it all, Gaetz has shown no hesitation to criticize fellow Republicans.

In a 2020 tweet, he accused Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., of “screwing all Americans"" by dumping stock using insider information as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. The Justice Department investigated Burr but brought no charges.

In Gaetz's book, in a first chapter called “Sex and Money,” he wrote that when he arrived in Congress, he asked current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for a seat on the Armed Services Committee. Gaetz wrote that “to my shock,"" McCarthy suggested he contribute $75,000 to the House GOP's campaign committee — a donation Gaetz wrote he actually doubled.

This past January, Gaetz helped spearhead an effort to depose Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., from her post as No. 3 House GOP leader after she was among 10 Republicans to vote for Trump's second impeachment.

Gaetz even traveled to a campaign event in Wyoming, where he urged voters to oppose her 2022 reelection and accused her of ignoring “the will of the people.” Days later, Cheney was reelected to her leadership post.

All of that helped alienate him from many Republicans, several GOP lawmakers and aides said.

Among his only defenders this week has been Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who tweeted, “Take it from me rumors and headlines don’t equal truth."" Greene has become a pariah even among some Republicans for showing support for false and violent sentiments.

Having a deep well of support among colleagues can help a beleaguered lawmakers retain their seat should party leaders begin viewing them as a liability. Ominously, McCarthy has called the charges against Gaetz “serious.""

Gaetz has reportedly had inconclusive discussions with Newsmax, a small pro-Trump television outlet, about working for it or another network. A person close to Newsmax said Friday the network has no plans to hire him as a talent.

The sleazy Matt Gaetz saga grows ever more disturbing,"A guide to navigating ‘Gaetzgate’

The Matt Gaetz story increasingly reads like a script written by a pervert high on a cocktail of ADHD meds and MDMA. Even if you’ve been following the scandal-prone Republican congressman’s latest controversy closely it’s hard to keep track of what on earth is happening. So here’s a guide to navigating the saga far.

First and foremost, it has been established that Gaetz is under federal investigation for sexual misconduct. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the justice department (DoJ) is investigating whether Gaetz, 38, “had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her to travel with him”. If these allegations are accurate, then Gaetz could have violated federal sex trafficking laws. According to the Times, the allegations are part of a broader investigation into a political ally of Gaetz’s named Joel Greenberg, a Florida tax collector who was indicted last year on charges including the sex trafficking of a child. Greenberg also reportedly misused public funds to buy servers for a cryptocurrency company as well as weapons, ammunition and a drone. As you do.

Related: DoJ reportedly investigating whether Matt Gaetz paid women for sex

After the Times broke the story, Gaetz confirmed to Axios that he was under federal investigation for sexual misconduct and is worried about being criminally charged. Rather predictably, however, he insists that he’s actually the victim in all of this and has said “no part of the allegations” against him are true. Gaetz, who is currently engaged to a woman 12 years younger than him, claimed that he used to be a “generous” partner in his single days and paid for flights and hotel rooms. “I think someone is trying to make that look criminal when it is not,” he said.

Why would someone want to do that? Well, in a statement released on Tuesday Gaetz said he and his family have “been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DoJ official seeking $25m while threatening to smear my name”. He claims the investigation is a cover for extortion and suggested that it was linked to the “Biden White House”. Which is a weird claim considering the New York Times reports that the investigation into Gaetz, a Donald Trump loyalist, was opened in the final months of the Trump administration under then attorney general William Barr.

Story continues

Here’s where things get really weird. According to the Washington Post, a couple of grifters who learned of the investigation against Gaetz decided to use the opportunity to extort the congressman’s father. They reportedly wrote to Don Gaetz and said that there were pictures of his son with “child prostitutes”; they would help Gaetz, however, if he gave them a large sum of money. The idea, dubbed “Project Homecoming”, was that they’d use that money to locate and rescue Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who was kidnapped in Iran back in 2007. Levinson, who is presumed dead, would be heroically rescued by Gaetz; Joe Biden would be so thrilled with the rescue that he’d pardon Gaetz.

The bottom line? It seems plausible that Gaetz really is caught up in a bizarre extortion plot. However, there are two possible scenarios here. Scenario one: Gaetz did nothing wrong and is telling the truth about being the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy orchestrated by his political rivals that kicked off when Gaetz’s buddy Trump was in power. Scenario two: there is no big conspiracy against the congressman; a couple of opportunists simply pounced on the investigation against him as a way to make money. I don’t know about you but the second scenario seems rather more plausible to me. Ultimately, it’s important not to let all the drama distract from the real issue here, which is that a sitting congressman seems to be under investigation for sex trafficking and has links to a guy who has already been indicted for sex trafficking. It doesn’t really look good for Gaetz. It looks so bad, in fact, that Gaetz’s communications officer abruptly left his job on Friday.

While the allegations against Gaetz are still being investigated, it’s worth noting that Gaetz has faced accusations of disturbing sexual conduct before. In January 2020 Chris Latvala, a Republican congressman, tweeted that Gaetz “created a game where members of the FL House got ‘points’ for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists, and married legislators”. Gaetz also reportedly bragged of his sexual exploits and showed other lawmakers nude photos of women he’d slept with. According to CNN, he showed his colleagues these photos while he was at work. Gaetz, by the way, was also the only lawmaker to vote against a bipartisan anti human-trafficking bill. A number of his colleagues have also spoken out about “love of alcohol and illegal drugs, as well as his proclivity for younger women”.

I don’t know exactly what Gaetz has or hasn’t done, but I do know he’s spent his career reveling in scandal rather than actually doing his job. He even joked with Elon Musk last week about how a scandal involving him would be called GaetzGate. The fact that this guy is a sitting member of Congress boggles the mind. It shows just how low we set the bar for our (male) politicians.

Boy, do I ever regret giving Gaetz the benefit of the doubt

I should state for the record that I wrote an article last year saying I thought it was unfair that people were insinuating Gaetz had an inappropriate relationship with his t “son”, Nestor. And there is no evidence, to be clear, that the relationship is inappropriate. However I have certainly learned my lesson: never ever even vaguely defend Matt Gaetz.

Andrew Cuomo is fighting to erect a skyscraper called Penn15 in Manhattan

I wish this was a joke but it’s not. The New York governor is facing a number of scandals but refuses to resign and is reportedly obsessed with this real estate project. Perhaps because the people behind it have given a lot of money to his campaigns.

The week in pawtriarchy

The only person who might be worse at their job than Cuomo is the genius who reportedly tried to pass off a golden retriever as a lion at a Chinese zoo. The zookeeper may have been inspired by an incident a few weeks earlier at another zoo in China where a supposed wolf’s cage housed a rottweiler.

On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"California OKs indoor sports, concerts as COVID cases plunge","The New York Times

NEW YORK — The Rev. Henry Torres told his parishioners, who had gathered on Palm Sunday in socially distanced rows of half-empty pews, that God had not abandoned them. The virus had killed dozens of regulars at the church, St. Sebastian Roman Catholic Church in Queens, and the pandemic forced it to close its doors for months last year. But the parishioners were there now, he said, which was a sign of hope. “Even through difficulties, God is at work,” Torres said. “Even when people are suffering, even if it may seem that God is silent, that does not mean that God is absent.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times That is a message that many Christians — and the cash-strapped churches that minister to them — are eager to believe this Easter, as the springtime celebration of hope and renewal on Sunday coincides with rising vaccination rates and the promise of a return to something resembling normal life. Religious services during the Holy Week holidays, which began on Palm Sunday and end on Easter, are among the most well-attended of the year, and this year they offer churches a chance to begin rebuilding their flocks and regaining their financial health. But the question of whether people will return is a crucial one. Across the city, many churches have still not reopened despite state rules that would allow them to do so. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, a nationally prominent Black church, said concerns over the coronavirus, and its disproportionate impact on the Black community, would keep his church from reopening until at least the fall. Nicholas Richardson, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, said many of its churches had also not reopened. When the diocese introduced a program last fall to allow its 190 parishes to pay a reduced tithe to the diocese, roughly half of them applied. “It varies church by church,” he said. “Pledges are not necessarily dramatically down, but donations given to the collection plate are hopelessly down.” The Rev. Patrick J. West, the pastor at St. Sebastian, said he and other priests have fretted over the return of parishioners when they gather for meals. Parishioners still fear the virus, which has killed tens of thousands of New Yorkers, and many have become accustomed to watching Mass online from the comforts of home, he said. “The word I use is ‘repatriate,’” he said. “How are we going to repatriate people back to the church? I don’t think it’s a matter of people’s faith, it’s a matter of health and safety. They need to be convinced that it is safe to worship in a congregation again, and I think that is absolutely right.” The hardships of the pandemic have been keenly felt at St. Sebastian, a bustling parish that offers Mass in English, Spanish and Tagalog inside a soaring, windowless space that was once a Loews movie theater. It sits on a busy intersection in the shadow of elevated subway tracks in Woodside, a working class but quickly gentrifying part of Queens where roughly 10% of the residents have been infected by the coronavirus, according to city data. “A lot of people have died,” said Micky Torres, a Filipino immigrant and longtime parishioner. A close friend of his from the parish died of COVID-19 in the first weeks of the pandemic, he said. It was his first of several Zoom funerals. “It was very sad and very weird.” At least 50 active parishioners at St. Sebastian have died of COVID-19, many in the early days of the pandemic when holding a funeral was impossible because the church was closed, said West. He began his assignment in the parish, which was founded in 1894 and moved into the former theater in 1954, shortly after churches were allowed to reopen at the end of June. The death rate in Woodside is higher than in the city as a whole, according to city data. “When I first got here it was memorial Mass after memorial Mass after memorial Mass,” he said. “We were having seven a week, plus funeral Masses for the people who were dying at that same time. We are still doing memorial Masses a year later.” St. Sebastian would normally welcome as many as 5,000 worshippers before the pandemic across several Masses on Saturdays and Sundays, said West. But pandemic rules limit its capacity to 50% and require social distancing. A good weekend now would draw roughly 1,200 people, less than a quarter of the pre-pandemic crowd, the pastor said. He said he hoped attendance at Easter would be robust, but there was no way to know for sure. The parish has adjusted in other ways, too. Masks and social distancing are required; hand sanitizer is readily available. Parishioners have also replaced the sign of peace, traditionally a handshake, with a nod or a wave. Churches were closed for 15 weeks during the first months of the pandemic last year, which included Holy Week. Even after they reopened at 25% capacity, many parishioners stayed away. That deprived parishes of both the people whose physical presence wills the community into existence, and the donations they make each week that help pay the bills. The resulting turmoil has wreaked havoc on the finances of churches across the New York region and the country, including icons like St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan and more humble houses of worship like St. Sebastian. All depend heavily on weekly donations to pay their expenses, which include utilities, staff salaries and an 8% tax paid to the local diocese. “We are hurting,” said West, who estimated the parish’s income had gone down 35% during the pandemic. The shortfall had forced him to keep the parish center closed, to lay off staff members in the parish office and even to ask the Diocese of Brooklyn to transfer one priest away from St. Sebastian. “We have a large immigrant population, and people are not used to using electronic payments or even writing checks,” said West. “If they are not physically here to donate cash, then we don’t physically get the donation.” Many Christians attend in-person services only on Christmas and Easter. Donations given on those two holidays make up 10% of the annual collection for most Catholic parishes, said Matthew Manion, the director for the Center for Church Management at Villanova University. He researched church finances during the pandemic and found steep income declines in parishes of all sizes. Based on figures from last year, he projects a 20% to 25% decline in the 2021 fiscal year, which may be exacerbated if people keep watching Mass online instead of in person. “The big questions are, Will Catholics who practice their faith frequently come back? And Catholics who practice their faith less frequently, are they gone for good?” said Manion. “Both of those answers could have big impacts, spiritually and financially.” He added: “Easter will be an interesting experiment. The spring will tell us a lot about what fiscal year 2022 and beyond will look like.” The mood was wary but hopeful at St. Sebastian on Palm Sunday, where street vendors sold woven palm fronds outside in the rain and a group of parishioners stood in the church foyer to listen to Mass, despite the audible rush and rattle of the elevated subway passing outside. Fewer than half the seats were filled at the morning’s English Mass, but a Spanish service later in the day was so well attended that worshippers were sent to the auditorium of the parish school so they could watch it on livestream while still obeying social distancing rules. Manuel Gil, a Peruvian immigrant who has worshipped at St. Sebastian for 25 years, said he thought the aftermath of the pandemic might actually bring more people to church, not fewer. “The important thing is that people have faith,” he said. “I think more people will come after the pandemic, because people whose families or friends have passed away will be looking for God. People’s lives have changed.” Speaking from the pulpit, Henry Torres urged parishioners to see the empty pews all around them as not just a manifestation of pandemic-era rules, but as vacant seats that might have been filled by those who died in the last year. But they should not dwell in sadness, he told the flock. Instead, they should celebrate the fact that they have survived. “You and I have been privileged and given an opportunity,” he said. “An hour from now is not promised. Tomorrow is not promised. All we have is right here and right now. Let us work right here and right now on our intimacy with God.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
AP source: Suspect in Capitol attack suffered delusions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The man who rammed a car into two officers at a barricade outside the U.S. Capitol, killing one of them before he was shot to death by police, had been suffering from delusions, paranoia and suicidal thoughts, a U.S. official told The Associated Press on Saturday. Investigators believe it was an isolated incident from a disturbed young man.

Video of the Friday afternoon attack shows the driver emerging from the crashed car with a knife in his hand and starting to run at the pair of officers, Capitol Police acting Chief Yogananda Pittman told reporters. Police shot the suspect, 25-year-old Noah Green, who died at a hospital.

Investigators are increasingly focused on Green's mental health as they work to identify any motive for the attack, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation and spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity. The official said investigators had talked to Green's family, who spoke of his increasingly delusional thoughts.

In online posts since removed, Green described being under government thought control and said he was being watched. He described himself as a follower of the Nation of Islam and its founder, Louis Farrakhan, and spoke of going through a difficult time when he leaned on his faith. Some of the messages were captured by the group SITE, which tracks online activity.

“To be honest these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher,” he wrote in late March. “I have been tried with some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life. I am currently now unemployed after I left my job partly due to afflictions, but ultimately, in search of a spiritual journey.”

It was the second line-of-duty death this year for the U.S. Capitol Police, still struggling to heal from the Jan. 6 insurrection. The attack underscored that the building and campus — and the officers charged with protecting them — remain potential targets for violence.

Story continues

Authorities installed a giant fence around the Capitol perimeter and for months restricted traffic along the roads closest to the building, but they had begun pulling back some of the emergency measures. And the most recent incident could delay the gradual reopening of the building’s grounds to the public.

“I just ask that the public continue to keep U.S. Capitol Police and their families in your prayers,"" Pittman said. ""This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol Police after the events of Jan. 6 and now the events that have occurred here today.

Police identified the slain officer as William “Billy” Evans, an 18-year veteran who was a member of the department's first responders unit.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hailed Evans as a “martyr for our democracy,” while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was “heartbroken.” Pelosi and Schumer both spoke Friday with members of Evans’ family.

President Joe Biden said in a statement that he and his wife were heartbroken to learn of the attack and expressed condolences to Evans’ family. He directed flags at the White House to be lowered to half-staff.

In 2013, officers with the Capitol Police and Secret Service fatally shot a woman inside her car after she led them on a high-speed chase that began outside the White House. Miriam Carey’s family said she suffered from postpartum depression with psychosis but was not dangerous.

Friday's crash and shooting happened at a security checkpoint near the Capitol typically used by senators and staff on weekdays, though most were away from the building for the current recess. The attack occurred about 100 yards (meters) from the entrance of the building on the Senate side of the Capitol.

The Washington region remains on edge nearly three months after a mob of insurrectionists loyal to former President Donald Trump stormed the building as Congress was voting to certify Biden’s presidential win.

Five people died in the Jan. 6 riot, including Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was among a badly outnumbered force trying to fight off the intruders. It took hours for the National Guard to arrive, a delay that has driven months of finger-pointing among that day’s key decision makers.

Almost 140 Capitol Police officers were wounded in that attack, including officers not issued helmets who sustained head injuries and one with cracked ribs, according to the officers' union. Two officers, one from Capitol Police and another from Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department, died by suicide following the Jan. 6 attack.

Capitol Police and National Guard troops were called upon soon afterward to secure the Capitol during Biden's inauguration and faced another potential threat in early March linked to conspiracy theories falsely claiming Trump would retake the presidency.

The area was locked down for hours Friday but has since reopened, and National Guard troops stood outside the building on Saturday.

Adriana Mejía lost half her family in just 83 days – now a huge death toll of 294,000 is being quietly acknowledgedCoronavirus – latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage Cemetery workers bury a victim of Covid-19 at Sueños Eternos cemetery in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images It took just 83 days for Adriana Mejía to lose half her family, as Covid unleashed a Mexican tragedy whose full impact is only now becoming clear. First to depart was her father, Juan, a 90-year-old carpenter who died at the family home in Mexico City last July after summoning his eight children to say goodbye. Two weeks later Mejía’s 55-year-old sister, Cecilia, who began feeling unwell as they buried their father, also lost her life. Two days later, on 3 August, Mejía lost her brother, Juan Carlos, then, 13 days after that, her brother-in-law, Germán. Even then, Mejía’s trials were not over. Two days after Germán’s death a second sibling, Miguel Roberto, died too. On 6 October she lost her mother. Graciela Murillo Altamirano was 89 when she was pronounced dead at the same home where her husband had expired almost three months earlier. “We’ve gone from rosary to rosary,” Mejía, a 46-year-old graphic designer from Mexico’s sprawling capital, said as she reflected on her family’s agony. “We just didn’t know when it would stop.” Mexico’s Covid crisis has made fewer international headlines than the catastrophes in the US and Brazil, where almost 900,000 people have died, accounting for about a third of the global total, and the reckless responses of rightwing populists Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro have been condemned. Bolsonaro’s anti-scientific handling of a disease he calls a “bit of a cold” and the spread of a more infectious variant linked to the Amazon has earned his nation particular infamy on the world stage. But the revelation this week that Mexico’s death toll was far higher than previously reported suggests a calamity of similar proportions has played out under its leader, the populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Last weekend Mexican officials discreetly acknowledged more than 294,000 Covid deaths – just shy of Brazil’s official death toll which was then 310,000. Brazil has a much larger population, with 212 million inhabitants compared with Mexico’s 126 million. Many believe a cavalier approach by the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has hampered the country’s ability to control the virus. Photograph: Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images Mexico’s Covid tsar Hugo López-Gatell defended his government in a recent interview, telling the Financial Times: “Our conscience is very clear.” “It’s a pandemic,” said the epidemiologist who in February caught Covid himself. “It would be senseless to think life would be normal.” Many, however, believe the president’s cavalier approach hampered Mexico’s ability to control its epidemic by confusing citizens – with terrible consequences for families such as the Mejías. Like Trump and Bolsonaro, López Obrador has downplayed the virus, continued to tour his country and embrace supporters and resisted containment measures such as lockdowns, social distancing and masks. “We’re doing well, the pandemic has been tamed,” the 67-year-old claimed last May when Mexico’s official death toll was about 9,000. In January, as Mexico was plunged into a devastating second wave, López-Gatell was photographed holidaying on an Oaxaca beach despite urging citizens to stay at home. “When we think about worst performers, I think you rank Mexico, Brazil and the US together now,” said Eduardo González-Pier, a former Mexican health undersecretary. “These are the three big bad performers – and I think that has to do with the way governments responded to the pandemic. “Before Biden, there were a lot of similarities in how these countries were run and how the pandemic was approached. Bolsonaro, Trump and López Obrador had a similar attitude: the denial, the delayed response, the minimisation of the severity, and also the idea of not suspending activities.” Many believe that approach helped create a disaster of needlessly large proportions. “I’m not claiming Mexico could have experienced something like Vietnam or Taiwan, which are best performers. But what if they had had just an average type of response with the same mortality you would see from an average country?” asked González-Pier, an economist and health specialist. “If you do the calculations you see … Mexico could have avoided 100,000 to 200,000 [deaths] … So that is the kind of damage that has been done.” Phase six of Mexico’s national vaccination plan began in Mexico City on 30 March, 2021. The country’s immunisation campaign is one of Latin America’s earliest. Photograph: Martin Gorostiola/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock The behaviour and mixed messaging of politicians are not the only explanations for Mexico’s drama. Chronic underinvestment in healthcare meant hospitals were not adequately equipped or staffed when the pandemic hit. Some of the world’s highest rates of diabetes and obesity meant Mexico was especially vulnerable to Covid-19. “It just happened to be a virus that was particularly vicious with the type of chronic conditions that Mexicans have a high prevalence of – uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, obesity, especially among younger and mature adults. And that, I guess, was bad luck,” González-Pier said. Public health expert Carlos Alonso Reynoso said he still believed Mexico had fared better than Brazil where “a tragedy of unimaginable proportions” was unfolding and nearly 70,000 people died last month. But Mexico’s “confused and ambiguous” communication had taken a toll. “If the government’s message had been clearer and more concise perhaps the number of cases could have been reduced,” Reynoso said. Five months after her mother’s death, Mejía said she believed her family had been “victims of the lack of information”. A psychologist is helping her come to terms with her bereavement. “I lost most of my family and yet I couldn’t cry until my mother died and the nightmare was over,” Mejía said. “That was the moment I was finally able to grasp everything that had happened.” González-Pier said he was encouraged to see Mexico’s immunisation campaign, one of Latin America’s earliest, gathering pace. Mexico’s epidemic has slowed in recent weeks although some fear Holy Week celebrations, when families gather and tourists flock to beaches, could trigger a painful third wave like the one now shaking Chile. “I think the Mexican population is still highly vulnerable,” the former health undersecretary warned, pointing to research suggesting only a quarter of the country had been exposed to the virus. “I wouldn’t be so sure we are through the worst.”",
The Strange Friendship That May Bring Down Matt Gaetz,"Alex Wong/Getty

Rep. Matt Gaetz is in the midst of one of the ugliest falls from political grace in decades. But, on a smaller and less public scale, Gaetz’s plummet largely mirrors one of his closest allies—the man who may have kickstarted his downfall: Joel Greenberg.

Gaetz, the Florida Republican, and Greenberg are friends. Until recently, both were wealthy players in the new Trumpist wave washing over the Florida GOP. Both were sons of successful fathers who made their names known across the state. Both hung out in the same circles, championed the same libertarian causes, and latched themselves onto the same Florida GOP icons, like Gov. Ron DeSantis and political operative Roger Stone.

And now, both have been ensnared in a federal probe looking into accusations that they recruited young women and paid them for sex, according to The New York Times.

These Text Messages Pointed the Feds to Matt Gaetz

As The Daily Beast reported on Friday, it was text messages about Gaetz and Greenberg’s off-hours trips to a government office that alerted investigators to the congressman’s involvement in alleged crimes—and eventually led them to what they determined to be a criminal sex ring.

But before Joel Greenberg was indicted for sex trafficking and directing attention to Gaetz, Greenberg was an eccentric tax collector with a political future and all the right connections.

Like Gaetz, Greenberg is the son of a wealthy local businessman. Dr. Andrew Greenberg co-founded a dental company with 92 offices across the state. Joel, who holds a stake in that company, went on to establish his own advertising agency, DG3. For a time, he also hosted “The Joel Greenberg Show,” a sports-themed talk radio show on WRSO 810 AM. He sold the ad company in 2015 and ran the next year for Seminole County tax collector, defeating the 78-year-old who had held the office since 1988.

Once in office, Greenberg immediately took outlandish steps for what should have been a low-profile and boring job. He moved the agency out of its rent-free government offices. He hired his friends. He handed out questionable contracts to longtime associates. He used his tax collector “badge” to pose as law enforcement and pull over a speeder. He even tried to get some tax employees to carry guns.

Story continues

But it was another type of alleged abuse of power that would eventually rope in his friend, Matt Gaetz.

Greenberg, whose government agency was tasked with shredding expired drivers licenses, was illegally creating fake IDs, according to investigators. And Gaetz was with him when the pair was caught on surveillance footage visiting the Lake Mary branch of the tax collector’s office on a weekend in April 2018, according to several people with knowledge of the incident.

handout

When asked by an employee if he had visited the office over the weekend, Greenberg responded via text: “Yes I was showing congressman Gaetz what our operation looked like. Did I leave something on?”

Images of text messages obtained by The Daily Beast show that Greenberg involved the congressman even further with a personal favor in September that year. That’s when he went outside of official protocol and directed an employee—on a Sunday afternoon—to quickly produce Gaetz a duplicate ID.

“Amy- is there anyway to assist one of our Congressmen in getting an emergency replacement ID or DL by Tuesday 2pm? His was lost yesterday and he’s got a flight Tuesday. Doesn’t have any other form of ID currently on him. Sorry to bother you on Sunday,” Greenberg wrote.

The favor was for his friend: “Matthew Louis Gaetz II,” born on May 7, 1982.

Those text messages made their way in early 2020 to the U.S. Secret Service, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and most recently, another federal agency, according to a source with knowledge of agents’ requests.

In the years before these incidents, Gaetz and Greenberg had publicly displayed a bond that referenced their similar thinking, interests, and friendship. Gaetz, the son of a former president of the Florida State Senate, climbed to the upper tier of Florida state politics at a young age.

But he gained an unsavory reputation, even among fellow Republicans, for allegedly creating what one legislator called a sex game where “members of the FL House got ‘points’ for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists and married legislators.” Sources in Tallahassee told reporters that Gaetz frequented a restaurant popular with local college kids, part of his attempts to pick up undergrads.

Republicans Have Been Waiting for a Matt Gaetz Scandal to Break

Greenberg’s personal history during that period is much more obscure. It’s unclear when his friendship with Gaetz began, but by July 8, 2017, the two each shared a picture of their dinner with Roger Stone.

Gaetz repeatedly called Greenberg his friend, whether it was to support the tax collector’s idea to accept bitcoin, share his op-eds, or make inside jokes about their mutual lobbyist friend, Chris Dorworth.

By 2018, Greenberg was telling BuzzFeed News that Gaetz was his political mentor, an article Gaetz reposted in full on his official congressional website. Both of them visited the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that year, where they snapped a selfie with a 21-year-old woman who worked on Ron DeSantis’s campaign for Florida governor.

In 2019, they shared photos of themselves at the White House with Dorworth, whom Gaetz considers his own “legislative mentor.”

They’ve both pushed for marijuana legalization as well. In January 2019, Gaetz shared a video on Twitter with Greenberg and John Morgan, an Orlando attorney who refers to himself as “Pot Daddy.” Greenberg was an avid cannabis user who frequently carried around a marijuana vape pen, said three people who saw him use it either in the tax office, at work parties, or with friends. And he became Gaetz’s go-to person for cannabis vapes, according to one of those sources.

They were close enough to mingle with family. A video posted to YouTube features a photo of Gaetz cradling Greenberg’s newborn daughter. Greenberg’s wife, Abby, shared a Facebook photo of another instance in which Gaetz held her child in front of the White House, flanked by a smiling President Donald Trump.

This week, a Florida state legislator, Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, told The Daily Beast about her own odd interactions with Greenberg and Gaetz, who would personally approach her—sometimes together.

“There was all this weird engagement and being friendly with me,” she said. “Matt Gaetz too. I don’t have his number. I don’t have any engagement with him. He's tried to engage with me on Twitter. I'm very careful about any response back to him.”

She said that Greenberg would frequently text her photos reminiscing about his party-boy past, and that in 2019 he and Gaetz teamed up on what she called a “weird” voicemail, which The Daily Beast published on Friday.

The Creepy, Disturbing Case That Ensnared Matt Gaetz

“We were just chatting about you, and talking about your lovely qualities,” Greenberg said in the message, followed by Gaetz’s comment: “We think you’re the future of the Democratic Party in Florida!”

On May 4, 2018, Gaetz took to Twitter to plug a new Greenberg policy innovation. “Pay your taxes in crypto currency? @MrJoelGreenberg says yes,” wrote Gaetz, now a member of the House Blockchain Caucus. He tagged a Greenberg parody account in the tweet, possibly by mistake.

A Seminole County audit last year showed that Greenberg had funneled about $66,000 in taxpayer funds to his own company, Government Blockchain Systems LLC. When auditors asked him about the company, Greenberg told them that he had been developing a new way to accept “cryptocurrency as payments” for taxes.

That innovation resurfaced this week in the form of new federal charges. Prosecutors allege that Greenberg stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from Seminole County taxpayers and sunk it into cryptocurrency. A millionaire, Greenberg also used about $240,000 in bitcoin to jump-start his doomed 2020 re-election bid.

Although Greenberg has never financially backed Gaetz’s federal campaign efforts, Greenberg’s parents have supported Gaetz, maxing out for him in the 2018 GOP primary. A year later, on June 9, 2020, Gaetz returned the favor, maxing out to Greenberg’s re-election.

Two weeks later, Greenberg was hit with his first indictment, on charges of stalking his Republican political opponent.

Prosecutors have vastly expanded those charges to a diverse list of crimes, ranging from wire fraud to sex trafficking, alleging that Greenberg had recruited at least one teenager between 14 and 17 years old to engage in a “commercial sex act” in 2017, in Central Florida and elsewhere.

That’s where Gaetz comes back in.

The New York Times revealed on Tuesday that federal investigators were also looking into whether Gaetz violated sex trafficking laws in his relations with an unnamed 17-year-old girl. The teen is allegedly the same victim at the center of the charges against Greenberg.

Follow-up reports from various outlets allege that Gaetz shared naked photos of his sexual partners on the House floor, induced underage women to have sex with his friends, and tapped ATMs, Apple Pay and Cash App to pay for sex, leaving a trail of receipts. Some of the men and women involved reportedly took ecstasy for the encounters.

Gaetz’s reputation in Congress hasn’t helped him refute these allegations. It’s well-known that Gaetz tended to date younger women, often in their early twenties, and had a prolonged relationship with a congressional intern just over the age of 21. CNN reported on Thursday that he was known to share nude photos of his sexual partners with other lawmakers on the House floor, and talked about having sex with them.

Trump Isn’t Coming to Matt Gaetz’s Rescue—for Now

Lawmakers have gossiped about his drinking and drug use for years, complaining that his office often smelled like weed and speculating that his weight loss while in Congress was due to cocaine. And his adversarial relationship with his colleagues—particularly fellow Republicans that he deemed insufficiently supportive of Trump—has cost him in his search for allies willing to stick up for him and rebut a constant stream of negative stories, even as Gaetz’s claims about an extortion plot have a ring of truth to them.

Gaetz’s initial response—that he was the victim of an “organized, criminal extortion” scheme with geopolitical implications—has added a bizarre new dimension to the whole story. The convoluted production roped in a former DOJ prosecutor, a serial fraudster, and his own father, who Gaetz said wore a wire at the FBI’s direction in order to bust the crime.

Gaetz produced a document from his alleged extorters, containing the absurd inveiglement that the DOJ would drop its sex crimes investigation if Gaetz loaned them $25 million to help spring a Jewish-American held hostage in Iran. The hostage, Bob Levinson, was declared dead last year by the U.S. government.

The exposure of the pressure campaign has done little to convince Republicans in Washington to rally to Gaetz’s defense. His spokesperson quit on Friday. His political idol, Trump, has stayed mum, as have the vast majority of his fellow Republican congressmen.

“The last time I had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old, I was 17,” Gaetz told The Daily Beast earlier in the week, one of his oddly-specific denials of the charges against him. “As for the Hill, I know I have many enemies and few friends. My support generally lies outside of Washington, D.C., and I wouldn’t have it any other way.”

"How the UN is combatting COVID-19's ""devastating"" blow to women","Women's gains in society have been dealt a serious blow by the coronavirus pandemic. The World Economic Forum estimates that the fallout from the virus could add another generation to the fight for gender equality, a goal it now predicts to be more than 100 years off.

In the face of this crisis, the branch of the United Nations that deals specifically with women's rights, U.N. Women, has launched a campaign to accelerate the implementation of commitments made by countries during the historic Fourth World Conference on Women. It was at that 1995 gathering in Beijing that then-first lady Hillary Clinton said, ""women's rights are human rights.""

Having just wrapped up the launch of the campaign with a three day conference called ""Generation Equality"" in Mexico City, U.N. Women's Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka spoke to CBS News' Haley Ott about the obstacles facing women today.

The transcript below has been edited for length and clarity.

CBS News: How has the COVID-19 pandemic set back the fight for gender equality around the world?

Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka: Well, it has set back women and girls significantly because this pandemic has been particularly harsh on those who have the least possibility to defend themselves. And women and girls fall very firmly in that category.

Two thirds of the jobs lost were lost by women, and it is because women tend to be in the lower bottom of the jobs hierarchy and their jobs are not protected in the main by the labor law. They do not have a means to bargain and they do not have benefits. If they are entrepreneurs, they are in the informal sector. They do not have savings, insurance. They cannot restructure their loan with their bankers.

And so if you're hit, that's it. It's you and your little kiosk to move on. If you are in the private sector, as in a formal sector — waitressing, in the tourism industry — with the lockdown, you are gone. And the possibility that some of these jobs will not come back because of automation means that women are really exposed and they are not, in the majority, the ones with the digital skills that could make them move on to other jobs.

Story continues

For girls, they are the majority of the school children who are not going back. And it's so devastating, because girls education, as you probably know, has been one of the things we've been fighting [for] since Beijing. And we were making progress, not perfect, but we're keeping girls at school for longer. And now, to just have these girls just dropping out just like that in one year is quite devastating. And this is also because forced marriage increased in the pandemic, trafficking of girls increased, as well as FGM [female genital mutilation] in some communities. So our work in addressing those harmful cultural practices has to go into first gear in order to make sure that we can retrieve the girls who have been married and take them back to school, we can track the girls who are trafficked and bring them back to their homes. And as you know, it is quite complex.

Many people have been pushed into poverty and extreme poverty during this pandemic, but it is disproportionately affecting women. Can you lay out what that means and what the steps might be to regain some of the ground that's been lost?

Forty-seven million women have been pushed into extreme poverty. And it's particularly worrying that the women in the ages between 24 and 35 are at highest risk. These are the women who have young children, are childbearing age, who have to make choices between unpaid care work and entering the labor market. And in many cases they opt for caring for the family, and that becomes a step further into poverty for them.

Do you see that shift being lasting?

There is a danger that the increase of the burden of care at home will over-live the pandemic, which is why we need to take action, which is why we are talking about a care system. And which is why we are also engaging employers to make sure that they do not allow for fragmentation of the jobs in such a way that men are the ones who are in the office, and in the name of flexibility, which isn't a bad thing, you end up by default having the women who are the ones who opt to stay at home, who are maneuvered in the family dynamics to be the ones who stayed home and the men who are the ones who go to work. Because that means that we are going back to the days and times where a woman's place was at home and the man's place was in the office.

I think what we would just like to emphasize to governments, especially, is that it is important that the fiscal stimulus that they are announcing are gender-purposed, that they have a way of targeting women, because it is a significant capital outlay. After this pandemic, many countries will not have fiscal space for more significant expenditure. If women are missed right now, it's going to take a long time to get the women back in.

At the beginning of when the world started seeing lockdowns, there were concerns that there would be a rise in domestic violence and domestic abuse. And we are seeing reports of many more predominantly women calling for help to specialist services or to law enforcement. What has the pandemic meant for domestic abuse and what can and should the global community do to address that?

Certainly, it has meant an increase of domestic violence in particular, without actually also stopping violence that's just perpetrated by a stranger, most of which is rape, some of which happens in public spaces or at work, or harassment in general. We have issued an urgent call to governments indicating that this is a shadow pandemic that they have to deal with with as much vigor as they do the health pandemic.

On a personal level, what has it been like for you in your role and as an activist to see what has happened for women in terms of gender equality this past year?

It's been devastating. But of course, as you know, as an activist, you can't be down for too long. It's important to fall forwards so that you get up and you take the next step.

"US consults with Japan, South Korea on North Korea approach","The Guardian

Vote in Bessemer, Alabama, is chance to inform younger generations about the role unions play, labor leaders say Union organizers outside the Amazon facility in Bessemer. Photograph: Nathan Posner/REX/Shutterstock Counting is currently under way for the historic union election at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, and union organizers and leaders throughout the labor movement are hoping the effort will help galvanize support for workers and unions in the south and across the US. Tevita Uhatafe, 35, a member of Transport Workers Union of America Local 513 in the Dallas area, was one of several union members and leaders who visited Bessemer to lend their support for the union organizing drive. “I just wanted to hear workers’ stories, see what was going on there and learn a little bit about what was going on with their lives, as well as what can we do to help these people and support this union effort,” said Uhatafe. The enthusiasm comes as a pivotal moment for US unions. Joe Biden was elected on a pro-union platform and only this week told a crowd in Pittsburgh: “I’m a union guy. I support unions. Unions built the middle class, and it’s about time they start to get a piece of the action.” The huge publicity the Amazon vote is attracting is a chance to inform a younger generations that have not received a lot of education on the history of the US labor movement about the role unions have played in Alabama, said Uhatafe. “I really wanted to show them that there’s a new generation that’s coming up that wants to bring this movement into this generation, and show people that we really do fight for their jobs and for their livelihoods,” he added. “There’s going to be a whole lot of organizing going on if this is successful – even if it isn’t, the fuse has been lit.” Other labor leaders and workers echoed his sentiments. “The union drive in Bessemer, Alabama, is going to have a ripple effect,” said Liz Shuler, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US. “It’s about so much more than Amazon. It’s about fundamental power and inequality. About a labor movement that’s innovating and organizing on a new frontier to take on issues like data collection, and making progress in the long march for civil rights. And Bessemer is inspiring people all over the country to take collective action with their co-workers. This isn’t the end, it’s a powerful beginning.” The coronavirus pandemic exposed poor working conditions in industries and jobs where workers are deemed “essential” and praised as “heroes” but often receive wages and benefits that make it difficult for them to make ends meet. The risks posed by Covid-19 often worsened working conditions and heightened concerns about safety protections in places like Amazon warehouses that not only continued operating, but saw surges in demand and profits. Chris Smalls, who was fired from Amazon’s Staten Island, New York warehouse after organizing a protest at the beginning of the pandemic over Covid-19 safety concerns, has spent the past year participating in actions and speaking out in favor of organizing efforts at Amazon around the US, including in Alabama. “This is the most important union drive since probably the Great Depression,” said Smalls. “The whole nation is watching this vote. Our hopes no matter which way it goes is that Alabama lights a spark for all of us to start organizing in a city near you. That’s exactly what we intend to do and I support any and all efforts to do so.” The union drive has drawn support from community leaders, organizers and elected officials around the US, and in the Birmingham, Alabama area. Labor unions, including the Major League Baseball Players Association, NFL Players Association, several members of Congress, celebrities and organizations have publicly endorsed the effort, participated in solidarity rallies in cities around the US, or visited Bessemer. Workers around the world have also posted video messages to publicly announce their support for the unionization effort. Bernie Sanders speaks at a rally in support of unionization at an Alabama Amazon facility on 26 March. Photograph: Nathan Posner/REX/Shutterstock “Without unions we would not have the 40-hour work week, vacation days, sick leave, or employee benefits that millions rely on. Unions built the middle class of this country, and have played a historic role in shaping Birmingham and Jefferson county as a whole, granting opportunities to thousands of working families,” said Randall Woodfin, mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, in a statement in support of the union. “Birmingham has a long history of workers of all races banding together to demand better working conditions, and the unionization effort in Bessemer is a critical chapter in the history of organized labor in our community.” The Rev Tonny H Algood with the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign explained that history in the south, as industrialization in the southern US grew after the second world war as corporations sought cheap, non-union workforces, and state governments have since characterized themselves as pro-industry. “The state has sided with corporations every time,” Algood said. As an example, he cited Jefferson county changing the traffic light patterns outside the Amazon warehouse at the request of the company as union organizers utilized the stop to speak with workers, and the use of local police providing security for the Amazon warehouse. From Martin Luther King’s launching of the Poor People’s Campaign in 1967, Alabama, especially in the Birmingham area, has a vast history of labor union organizing connected to the civil rights movement. During the 1960s, civil rights activists in Birmingham relied on their labor union relationships to bolster the civil rights movement, such as Col Stone Johnson, who recruited other union members to serve as bodyguards for the homes and churches of local civil rights movement leaders, or Henry Jenkins, a Retail Wholesale Department Store union member and shop steward in Birmingham, Alabama, who faced racist threats and attacks while organizing workers in the area in the 1960s. An estimated 85% of the workers at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer are Black, and organizations like Black Lives Matter-Birmingham and union organizers have emphasized these connections through the union effort. “This type of organizing and collaboration is not new to Alabama. It seems as though Amazon thought that they can come to Alabama and extend this slave labor-like working environment and that would be okay here,” said Celida Soto Garcia, the president of Sweet (Sustainable Water, Energy and Economic Transition) Alabama. “I guess they didn’t read up on history, because that’s never permissible here in our state. Historically it never has been and never will be.” She expressed disappointment with Amazon’s adversarial response to the union organizing drive, especially given the immense wealth founder Jeff Bezos has accumulated from the company. Throughout the union election process, Amazon has hired expensive anti-union consultants, attempted to delay the election and force an in-person vote, and pushed anti-union messages to workers through texts, posters, ads, emails, a website, captive audience meetings and mailings. Amazon’s union opposition has extended to social media, as executives and its public relations team have repeatedly asserted the company’s union opposition. “I really expected more from Amazon. We celebrated their arrival here because we expected more from this multibillion-dollar corporation but it seems that they want to move forward with treating our invaluable people here in Alabama like cogs in the machine,” added Soto Garcia. “We’re going to win this for them and we’re not going to stop fighting until we win this for them.”",

At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch.

Kremlin Spy and Ex-U.S. Convict Sent to Humiliate Navalny in Prison,"The Daily Beast

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/GettyDETROIT—Jayme McElvany was at it again.A junior wrestler at Lakewood High School in western Michigan had been asked to comply with a state-mandated quarantine after close contact with another student who tested positive for COVID-19. McElvany, an anti-lockdown activist in the state, seized on his case as her latest cause célèbre even as the coronavirus pandemic in Michigan reaches new heights.“GUYS!!!! One of our wrestlers that we donated to yesterday already got a hearing!! Right now!! At 11:30! Here’s the link to watch Jimmy fight for this kid!!” McElvany wrote on Facebook Wednesday, namechecking local defense lawyer James Thomas. “PRAY for a VICTORY!!... Please Lord stand with Jimmy and help him touch the heart of this judge... for the sake of this child and many more like him. In Jesus name AMEN!!”The quarantine mandate would have forced the teenager to forfeit his shot at a state championship. But from the chambers in her rural central Michigan courtroom, Barry County Judge Vicky Alspaugh cited the weight of the public health implications at play before ultimately ruling in favor of allowing the student to wrestle as long as he tested negative for COVID-19 prior to the Friday match.The teen was just one of a number of student-athletes who sought to duck quarantines in order to participate in high-school competitions despite an alarming resurgence of the virus in Michigan over the last month. But far more important than the ambitions of any teenager, experts say, is an unhinged right-wing pressure campaign against safety restrictions. On one hand are the state’s hardline Republican leaders and their cadre of anti-lockdown activists like McElvany, a QAnon-curious mom and activist leading the charge for school sports that experts say is feeding the new outbreak.The ‘Wolverine Watchmen’ Accused of Targeting Michigan Guv Spooked Their NeighborsOn the other is Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The Democrat’s strict pandemic orders may have saved thousands of lives even as they inspired a far-right kidnapping plot against her. But she has also come under fire for what critics describe as buckling to political pressure and loosening restrictions on activities that are now playing a role in stoking a concerning fourth wave, including lifting the ban on indoor school sports in February.“Any sport where people are in close contact and gathering together, it’s very difficult to do it safely,” Georgetown University law professor and global health expert Lawrence Gostin told Daily Beast.Gostin, a strong proponent of keeping schools open if at all possible, said the state erred in its decision to resume indoor contact sports in high schools, especially without mandated routine testing protocols like professional athletes. “It’s highly irresponsible to do that,” he said.Gostin expressed similar views about the state’s decision in January to open up indoor dining, saying: “That’s a serious mistake.”The state has seen its COVID rates skyrocket in recent days, with more than 6,000 new cases reported Wednesday and Thursday. With a positivity rate around 15 percent, Michigan now enjoys the dubious distinction of having the most cases per capita nationwide. The surge comes as state health officials have warned that a significant number of outbreaks and cases associated with the March surge are tied to schools, primarily extracurriculars like sports.“The largest number of outbreaks are in K-12 school settings,” Sarah Lyon-Callo, the epidemiology director at the state health department, said during a press conference last month. She noted that spread was minimal in classrooms and coming instead from extracurricular activities.“We are certainly identifying outbreaks that are associated with sports,” Lyon-Callo added.As of early this week, there were more than 270 outbreaks tied to Michigan schools, with the state reporting an additional 70 outbreaks in their weekly update on Monday, and hundreds of students infected.Critics of Whitmer say what the state is experiencing now should come as no surprise, given lax enforcement of masking and other rules she imposed—and her allowing sports to resume without mandated testing for athletes in the first place. As high school sports’ COVID problem became clear in recent weeks, the state did impose a new mandate for weekly testing that will go into effect on Friday, nearly two months after competition resumed.“The key word there is indoor,” Zach Binney, an epidemiologist at Oxford College of Emory University, told The Daily Beast. “We have multiple examples now from the CDC where we know sports, the wrong kind of sports—indoors, with close contact, especially without masks—can spread [the virus].”A spokesperson for Gov. Whitmer did not respond to requests for comment for this story. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the state health department cited the U.K. variant as contributing to spread, and noted the new safety measures imposed on school sports.""The state is moving forward with plans to ramp up testing for schools, businesses and nursing homes,” they told The Daily Beast. “We are expanding a mandatory testing protocol for all student athletes. And we have increased our vaccine program over the last couple of weeks.""Even as they took issue with the governor, her critics seemed to implicitly acknowledge the effectiveness of right-wing activists.“We pulled on the heartstrings—‘These kids need to play’—and the emotional, that’s what resonates,” Dr. Tamara Hew-Butler, a podiatric physician specializing in sports medicine and an associate professor of exercise and sport science at Wayne State University in Detroit, told The Daily Beast.McElvany, organizer of the activist group Let Them Play, was leading that charge.A broad range of voices expressed support for letting kids play winter sports. But McElvany, a mom from Milan, Michigan, monopolized much of the local news coverage. In a matter of days, she raised more than $50,000 for the cause via an online fundraiser.In addition to having a child who plays high school sports, McElvany’s Facebook activity grabbed attention with posts about the Jan. 6 rally-turned-riot in Washington, D.C., and COVID disinformation. On the morning of Jan. 6, her rhetoric mirrored QAnon conspiracy theories, with a post saying “it’s gonna be the most shocking day in American history today… Everyone needs to be ready for what’s about to be revealed.” There is no evidence McElvany took part in the insurrection.A now-deleted Facebook group called “Jayme’s Wake Up Call” was taken down after the Michigan Advance inquired about it in January. In it, McElvany promised “the most up to date info I have about the election fraud, the virus, Biblical truths, the cabal, the political corruption, world corruption, end times, child sex trafficking, NWO [New World Order]… all the important stuff!”McElvany has previously denied being a QAnon adherent, and when The Daily Beast reached her by phone this week, she said she was out at a birthday party for her son. She also asked if the outlet was conservative or liberal, and said she was concerned about speaking publicly without first consulting her attorney. She did not respond to subsequent requests for comment.Of course, McElvany wasn’t alone, and Whitmer has claimed the activist’s group did not influence her. Among those beating a similar drum: Detroit’s public school district superintendent Nikolai Vitti, who publicly urged the governor to loosen rules, claiming hundreds of Michiganders were already leaving the state to play sports.According to Vitti, the idea that school districts were preparing to open for instruction on March 1, but not sports, was a contradictory message. Like Let Them Play, Vitti warned of legal action, saying parents, athletes, and coaches were already in conversation with attorneys.“Please do not let this frustration reach the level of a lawsuit against you and the state,” he wrote. Vitti did not respond to a request for comment.Whitmer initially pushed back, responding to the growing chorus against the state order barring indoor contact sports with sympathy, but declining to change it. The more contagious B.1.1.7—or U.K.—variant of the coronavirus had just arrived in the state via a student at the University of Michigan, and cases were detected in the Big Ten School’s athletic department, bringing sports to a halt and forcing the campus into lockdown.A few days later, a Republican lawmaker introduced legislation to lift the suspension on school sports. The movement was gaining momentum and more than a thousand people attended a Jan. 30 Let Them Play protest at the state capitol, including a former Detroit Red Wings hockey star and the son of Republican Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey.Then Let Them Play filed suit against the state health department, claiming the order violated the constitution’s equal protection clause.Militiaman Who Plotted to Kidnap Gretchen Whitmer Pleads Guilty, Turns on His PalsTwo days later, Whitmer relented, allowing winter sports to resume with an order that mandated mask wearing and quarantines for exposed athletes. Still, it stopped short of requiring routine COVID testing except for sports where masks could not be worn—a stipulation that applied only to wrestlers.According to Hew-Butler, who has followed the restrictions and openings around sports in Michigan closely over the course of the school year, the state needed to mandate and enforce routine testing, on par with the programs in professional and college sports, if it wanted to avoid the kind of outbreaks they’re recording now.“You have to know what’s out there,” she said.Of course, the right-wing pressure campaign derailing COVID safety in the state has come in many flavors, and much of the defiance remains at longtime hot spots like bars and restaurants.Ian Murphy owns the Iron Pig, a barbecue restaurant and bar in Gaylord, which Murphy himself acknowledged is one of the state’s COVID hot zones. He decided to open during last winter’s lockdown, and promptly had his liquor and food licenses revoked by the state.Numerous administrative hearings later, Murphy—who was lambasted by some for selling “Kiss Me, I’m Contagious” T-shirts at the Iron Pig for St. Patrick’s Day this month—was ordered to pay a steep fine, and got his operating licenses back in mid-March.In other words, just as the local school districts and sports teams were battling outbreaks. Otsego County now has one of the highest rates of per-capita COVID infection in the state.Murphy said there haven’t been any known cases of COVID at the Iron Pig over the past year, but that he had two employees who were exposed to the virus quarantine voluntarily this week “out of an abundance of caution.”Whitmer has also been criticized over her January move to re-open indoor dining; the state’s health department director Robert Gordon signed off on the new order, but abruptly announced his resignation just hours later.While rebellious restaurants have garnered much of the spotlight, and public ire, in the winter wave, the loosened restrictions and school-related outbreaks appear to have given people like Murphy new cover.“I'm not a doctor, I'm not an epidemiologist,” he told The Daily Beast, noting that he does not have kids of his own. “But anecdotally, to me, it seems like students, at almost any level, may be the ones that are really the spreaders of it.”“There are plenty of parents I know personally that are really blaming the student-athletes in our town for this recent outbreak,” he added.This weekend, families from school districts across the state will be returning from Spring Break vacations and others will likely be traveling or gathering for Easter. The final rounds of state championship playoffs will take place for several sports—albeit this time with the new testing mandate in effect.In St. Clair County, one of Michigan’s current hot spots located in the rural eastern area of Michigan known as “the Thumb”, the health department and local school district are hosting a “Welcome Back Spring Breakers” event on Sunday. It will consist of a mass, drive-up COVID testing clinic all afternoon at a local stadium.Meanwhile, if Whitmer thought she had placated the teen sports crowd, she was wrong. On Thursday, Let Them Play filed a lawsuit over the more rigorous sports safety protocols. And some of the governor’s critics fear the worst is yet to come.“We’re already on the exponential increase,” Hew-Butler, the Wayne State sport-science professor, said. “I’m worried that we get to the same place, where it’s gone so far into the community where it continues to spread, and then we’re going to end up with a lot of people in hospital and the hospitals are going to be overwhelmed.”“I think that’s what everybody’s watching now.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"For New York City, Glimmers of Hope and Signs of Revival","NEW YORK — For New York City’s economy, the last 12 months have amounted to one long, brutal winter. The pandemic forced the shutdown of most of the city’s businesses, wiped out hundreds of thousands of jobs and kept away tens of millions of tourists.

By many measures, the nation’s biggest city suffered the greatest losses and faces one of the longest and steepest climbs back. Shows will not return to Broadway stages until after Labor Day, and many workers will not begin commuting to the office and buying lunch at the corner deli for months, if they return at all.

But for the first time since the city went on lockdown late last March, there are palpable signs of rebirth, fueled by a growing supply of COVID-19 vaccines and an impending gusher of federal aid to City Hall, the schools, the transit system, restaurants and theaters.

Shoots of the budding optimism pop up almost daily: The Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking Central Park called back workers for a reopening this week. Union Square Café, a popular Manhattan restaurant that had been closed for months, is feeding diners again. Fans were in the stands again when the New York Yankees opened their season in the Bronx on Thursday, though limited to one-fifth of the seats.

The city’s outlook has improved as result of the latest stimulus bill, financial analysts say, which included about $6 billion in direct aid to the city government, $6.5 billion to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and $4 billion to the city’s public schools.

“There’s a lot of cash that’s going to come in fairly quickly here,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It’s going to provide big pops to places that have been more or less shut down.”

The federal aid will help solve some of the city’s biggest short-term problems, including huge drops in revenue from property and sales taxes and fares that the MTA, which runs the subway, buses and two commuter rails, is heavily dependent on.

Story continues

Still, the road to full recovery will be long and steep, business leaders and analysts say.

Entire industries, including the arts, hotels and restaurants, were decimated, with thousands of businesses closing for good. Tourism, a pillar of the economy, is years away from rebounding, according to forecasts. And many companies are making at least some remote work a permanent feature, raising questions about the future of Manhattan without legions of office workers.

“The city still has a ways to go,” said Ana Champeny, director of city studies for the Citizens Budget Commission. “You’ve got to get commuters back in Midtown and downtown, the business district. You’ve got to get restaurants and theaters reopened.”

The infusion of federal aid has provided some reason for hope.

The MTA has gone from threatening to sharply reduce service and lay off workers to promising to restore 24-hour subway service, which was suspended during the pandemic.

Many restaurants that struggled to survive through a monthslong ban on indoor dining can try to recoup losses and the costs of adapting to pandemic restrictions.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader from New York, said the aid that will flow to New York state and its residents from the stimulus bill, known as the American Rescue Plan, amounted to nearly $100 billion.

Mayor Bill de Blasio will lay out a plan for spending the direct aid when he presents his budget in April, said a spokeswoman, Laura Feyer. The mayor said the aid would enable the city “to finally overcome the massive revenue loss and to serve our people, keep our workforce strong, bring our city back.”

The direct local aid “can put the city on solid fiscal footing,” said Champeny, though the city still faces large budget deficits in future years. “It is an incredibly generous package that will definitely start the rebuild.”

The rebuild faces formidable challenges.

The New York metropolitan area lost more than 1 million jobs in 2020, close to double the Los Angeles area’s loss and triple the Chicago area’s, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The city’s official unemployment rate rose to 12.9% in February, more than double the national rate, which was 6.2% in February and fell to 6% in March.)

The job losses fell harder on those who were clinging to the lower rungs of the city’s economic ladder. Low-paying jobs that cannot be done from home accounted for most of the losses, and many may not come back for years, if ever, economists said.

New York was especially vulnerable to the pandemic’s economic pummeling because of its heavy reliance on tourists and business travelers to fill hotel beds and seats in restaurants, theaters and stadiums.

The number of foreign visitors to New York is not expected to reach its 2019 level before 2025, according to the city’s tourism promotion agency.

New York’s office towers are still largely empty, and the exodus of office workers from Manhattan — many of whom are not expected to return until the last half of the year — has crippled merchants and significantly reduced the value of much of the city’s commercial real estate, which will translate into a big drop in sales and property tax revenue.

The city’s Independent Budget Office projected that the city’s recovery would remain “fragile and tentative for many more months.”

Though a snapback in hiring this year and next would replace about 400,000 of the jobs the city lost, the budget office said that by the end of 2024 New York would still not have as many jobs as it did before the pandemic started.

More than 200 of the city’s 700 hotels remain closed, leaving thousands of workers still unemployed, said Vijay Dandapani, chief executive of the Hotel Association of New York City. “My industry fell off a cliff on March 22 last year,” he said.

Many hotel operators have received no federal aid during the pandemic, and nearly half are in default on their mortgages, Dandapani said. More than 40 hotels have fallen behind on their property tax payments to the city, which could put them in “a downward spiral” that they cannot escape, he added.

But even the beleaguered hotel business is seeing glimmers of recovery. The Mandarin Oriental rehired more than 100 members of the Hotel Trades Council union for its reopening on Thursday, the hotel’s manager, Susanne Hatje, said. The Mandarin is offering discounted rates starting at $716 per night, 20% below prepandemic prices.

The nearby Park Hyatt also reopened on Thursday, and other hotels are expected to join the trend as tourists trickle back. During the week that ended March 20, the city’s hotels had an occupancy rate of 50.8%, the highest in more than a year, according to STR, an industry research firm.

Tourism may start to pick up slightly by late summer if fans return to the stands at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens. And if delegates come back to Manhattan in September for the United Nations General Assembly, hotels may fill more rooms.

The city’s tourism promotion agency, NYC & Co., has forecast that the number of visitors will climb to 38 million this year, up from about 23 million in 2020, but still down about 40% from a record high level in 2019.

Despite the city’s precarious situation, E.J. McMahon, founder of the Empire Center, a conservative research group, said he was wary about the extraordinary amount of federal aid flowing to the region.

The pandemic’s impact on New York’s economy appears to be much deeper and longer lasting than the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack two decades ago, he said. “There’s going to be a hangover from this, a significant hangover.”

Still, McMahon questioned, “What it is that government can do to actually re-create the economy?” Many of the lost jobs, such as cleaning hotel rooms and serving food, did not require much skill or extensive training, he said. “There’s a lot of potential here for problems and abuse of the money.”

But James A. Parrott, an economist at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School, argued that the city should use some of the federal aid to retrain workers who have lost their jobs.

“Tens of thousands of jobs will permanently disappear, and the city needs to do more to preserve the businesses that are trying to hang on,” Parrott said. “The city has never had a challenge on this scale before.”

The restaurant business is one important part of New York’s private-sector economy that will benefit directly from the stimulus bill. The bill included more than $28 billion for restaurants across the nation that have been among the businesses worst hit by the pandemic’s economic fallout.

A sizable chunk of that aid will likely go to New York’s restaurants because they experienced some of the longest and most severe restrictions, said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group. A recent survey by the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, estimated that 5,000 restaurants in the city had shut down for good during the pandemic.

“This will save countless restaurants and jobs,” Rigie said. “It’s horrible that restaurants had to wait a year for this funding, but better late than never.”

While it may take some time, “the city is going to see a big revival,” Zandi said. “It’s going to come roaring back.”

Feds: Couple tried to travel by ship to join Islamic State,"The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch.

Iraq judge who presided over Saddam's trial dies of COVID-19,"BAGHDAD (AP) — A retired Iraqi judge who presided over the trial of Iraq's late dictator Saddam Hussein has died after battling COVID-19, the country's top judicial body said Friday.

According to Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council, Judge Mohammed Oreibi al-Khalifa, 52, passed away in a hospital in Baghdad where he was being treated for complications from the coronavirus.

Oreibi graduated from the Faculty of Law at Baghdad university in 1992 and was appointed a judge in 2000 by a presidential decree.

He shot to fame after he was named an investigative judge in the trial of Saddam and his regime in August 2004. He later took over as the lead judge in Saddam's trial for genocide, which also included Saddam's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, known as Chemical Ali, and five other defendants on charges related to their roles in the bloody 1987-1988 crackdown against Kurdish rebels, known as the Anfal campaign.

The prosecution alleged that around 180,000 people died, many of them civilians killed by poison gas. Saddam was subsequently convicted and sentenced to death; he was executed on Dec. 30, 2006.

Oreibi, a Shiite, replaced Judge Abdullah al-Amiri, who was removed amid accusations he was too soft on Saddam during the trial. Oreibi tolerated very few disruptions from Saddam and his co-defendants during the trial — even throwing the deposed Iraqi leader out of the courtroom several times amid fiery exchanges between them.

In one session, after a shouting match between them, he ordered Saddam held in solitary confinement for several days.

The statement from the judicial council lauded Oreibi for his what it said was courage in handling the trial of Saddam and the former regime.

“He remains immortal in the hearts of Iraqis in general and the judges in particular,” it said.",
US and Iran agree to 'breakthrough' nuclear deal talks in Vienna,"Iran's President Hassan Rouhani and officials said direct talks with US were ""unnecessary"" - AFP

The Biden administration on Friday hailed a potential breakthrough in deadlocked efforts to revive the Iranian nuclear deal after Tehran agreed to talks through European allies.

Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany will be among those meeting with the US and Iran for negotiations in Vienna next week, marking the first major progress in attempts to return both countries to the 2015 accord.

President Joe Biden has promised to rejoin the agreement on condition Iran first returns to respecting commitments it abandoned in retaliation for Donald Trump pulling out and reimposing swingeing sanctions. Tehran, however, has said Washington must end the sanctions before it will make any moves to get back in line.

The US is trying to use Europe as an intermediary with Iran after the Islamic Republic refused to join direct talks with the Biden administration.

Iranian diplomats attending a virtual talk on nuclear deal with representatives of world powers, in Tehran, Iran - Iranian Foreign Ministry

The Vienna meeting will aim at drawing up two separate agreements, one with the US and one with Iran on which steps they will take when to return to compliance with the agreement. The two sides will not meet directly.

The US would not insist on retaining sanctions, the Telegraph understands, believing that the previous “maximum pressure” campaign waged by the Trump administration was ultimately futile.

Ned Price, US State Department spokesman, on Friday called the talks a ""healthy step forward"" and said that Washington ""remains open"" to a direct encounter with Tehran.

Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said he was optimistic the US was willing to compromise. He added: “I very much hope that the anti-Iranian inertia that was observed at first will give way to common sense.”

It comes after a year of quiet diplomacy that has failed to produce much headway.

The aim is to reach an agreement within two months, said a senior official with the EU, the coordinator of the deal. ""If we don’t get there [within that time frame] ...it will be definitely bad news,"" the official told Reuters.

Story continues

Signatories to the deal are hoping to make headway before Iran holds presidential elections in June, a milestone that could lead to a new Iranian negotiating team and more delays.

However, any return of the US would involve complications.

Since the US withdrawal from the pact, Iran has been steadily violating its restrictions, like the amount of enriched uranium it can stockpile and the purity to which it can enrich it.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that over the past two years, Iran has accumulated a lot of nuclear material and new capacities and used the time for ""honing their skills in these areas.""

At home, Mr Biden has to contend with opposition from Republicans in the Senate, most of whom opposed the deal - which was signed by the Obama government - in the first place.

Analysts say he must not give the sense that he is giving in to Iranian demands.",
Major companies are suddenly denouncing GOP-led voting bills. Why now?,"Voting rights advocate Nsé Ufot has been fighting for a week like this all year.

For months, more than a half-dozen activists groups, including her own New Georgia Project, had urged business interests to denounce Republican-led efforts to restrict voting access in Georgia, she said. Billboards had gone up across the state that parodied corporate slogans, urging action. Advocates projected campaigns on the side of a hotel hosting attendees for the NBA All-Star weekend in early March.

The companies had offered cautious statements, and what Ufot calls ""hand-wringing"" and ""shoulder shrugging."" That is, until Wednesday, when Atlanta-based Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola issued forceful condemnations of Georgia's new restrictive voting law, enacted last week. From there, corporate criticism of Republican voting bills seemed to spread like wildfire — moving across state lines and morphing into a national trend that activists say finally reflects the urgency of the sheer number of restrictions under consideration across the U.S.

""There’s a clarity about January 6 that people get, that that was an attack on our democracy,"" Ufot said. ""If you understand that the attack on the Electoral College vote was unpatriotic and anti-democratic, then you need to continue down that same logical street until you get to these 360 plus bills in 47 states that are trying to make it more difficult for Americans to vote.""

Major corporations' foray into the election policy debate, which experts called unusual, comes as Republicans across the country work to advance hundreds of restrictions, changes that voting rights advocates and civil rights groups argue would disproportionately impact voters of color. By March 24, lawmakers had introduced 361 restrictive election bills in 47 legislatures, according to the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which has been tracking the legislation. That's 108 more than in the center's last count, on Feb. 19, a 43 percent increase.

GOP lawmakers say these bills are needed to improve public confidence in the results, even as they cast doubt on the outcome of the 2020 elections themselves. By all accounts, the 2020 election was secure and the results accurate, despite former President Donald Trump's repeated and false claims otherwise. His own attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and the then-president's legal efforts to overturn the results failed in courtrooms around the country.

Advocates said the last year of speaking up — about civil rights and the pandemic particularly — primed companies to get involved on this issue, too.

“This week was really the week that corporate America stepped back up,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, vice president for development at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. “And really, I think was called to task to put their money where their mouth was for all the things they said they were for in 2020.”

Weiss-Wolf works with corporations in her fundraising work at the nonpartisan organization but said in the last year she started helping companies find their civic voice, too. In 2020, hundreds of companies committed to giving employees time to vote or paid time off to serve as poll workers. Amid a racial reckoning inspired by George Floyd, a Black man who died last May after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes, many issued statements underscoring their support of civil rights and committing to anti-racist action.

After a pro-Trump mob fueled by Trump's stolen election lie attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, dozens of corporations paused donations from their political action committees, with some saying they wouldn’t give to Republicans who challenged the results of the election.

The Civic Alliance, a nonpartisan group that encourages civic participation from businesses, put out a letter Friday condemning any effort to restrict ballot access, with nearly 200 companies, including Salesforce, ViacomCBS and The Estée Lauder Companies, as signatories.

“Companies have their fingers on the pulse of what’s going on with their consumers and employees and this is a priority for folks and so companies are making it a priority for themselves,” said Mike Ward, co-founder of the Civic Alliance.

A letter from Black business leaders — published on Wednesday in a full-page ad in The New York Times and signed by more than 70 Black business executives — made his group's action imperative, he said.

“That was the moment, it was like, yup, this is an urgent priority and we’re going to release something as soon as possible,” he told NBC News. “It went from being something that was taking days long to work toward to being hours long to work toward.”

Lisa Cylar Barrett, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the letter was a “really critical turning point.”

She said the trick now is to stay in the game.

“It’s really important that they remain involved, so this can’t just be — make a statement and disappear,” she told NBC News. “We’ve gotta see this through.”

Ufot said she was heartened by the momentum, but said it’s not enough. The Georgia law is still on the books.

“We don’t feel like we’ve won yet,” she said. “Symbols matter, but in what way does this prevent us from going to jail for handing out bottle water to voters in line?”

Republicans have responded forcefully to corporations' new-found outspokenness. In Georgia, the state House immediately set about repealing a tax credit the legislature afforded Delta.

“You don’t feed a dog that bites your hand. You got to keep that in mind sometimes,"" said Republican Georgia state House Speaker David Ralston, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. (The effort died in the state Senate.)

Elsewhere, Republicans have blasted criticism of their election policies as the latest issue in the so-called culture wars.

“Cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included,” Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement Friday after Major League Baseball announced it would move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta in protest of the state's law.

Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick, a Republican, tried to tie it to ongoing legislative fights over transgender students participating in sports, around the country and in Texas, too.

“Texans are fed up with corporations that don’t share our values trying to dictate public policy,"" he said in a statement.

Harvard Kennedy School professor Alex Keyssar, author of the “The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States,"" said he'd seen companies mobilize on LGBTQ rights, but never around voting rights.

""What makes this complicated is that in this case, it’s not just the issue. It’s the fact that these laws are being justified in the name of the 'Big Lie' and thus it’s a repudiation of the Republican Party as it exists today,"" he said, referring to how Democrats have described Trump's stolen election lie.

Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, said the moves were indicative of a much greater change.

""It's both a good and a bad sign. It's a good sign in that voting rights is getting the kind of visibility as an issue that I think it's long deserved — then years ago when I was working in this space, I couldn't get people to think about it,"" he said in an interview Friday. ""The fact that it’s all happening is a bad sign because it means voting rights is very much a part of the culture wars.""

Historian Michael Beschloss, meanwhile, said the week’s political groundswell fit right into the nation’s civil rights history and pointed to Martin Luther King Jr.'s final speech, delivered on April 3, 53 years ago.

In it, King vows to use boycotts and corporate power to fight for justice, listing off companies like Coca-Cola and Wonder Bread as targets and arguing that these companies needed to get involved in an ongoing union strike.

“I don’t see how anyone can say this is radical or out of keeping with American tradition,” Beschloss said of the corporations answering calls to come off the sidelines on the issue of voting. “This tool is an old tool in American history.”",

There’s nothing unusual about exaggeration in politics. But when it comes to the debate over voting rights, something more than exaggeration is going on. There’s a real — and bipartisan — misunderstanding about whether making it easier or harder to vote, especially by mail, has a significant effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. The evidence suggests it does not. The fight over the new Georgia election law is only the latest example. That law, passed last week, has been condemned by Democrats as voter suppression, or even as tantamount to Jim Crow. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Democrats are understandably concerned about a provision that empowers the Republican-controlled state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. That provision has uncertain but potentially substantial effects, depending on what the Legislature might do in the future. And it’s possible the law is intended to do exactly what progressives fear: reshape the electorate to the advantage of Republicans, soon after an electoral defeat, by making it harder to vote. And yet the law’s voting provisions are unlikely to significantly affect turnout or Democratic chances. It could plausibly even increase turnout. In the final account, it will probably be hard to say whether it had any effect on turnout at all. The Georgia law The Georgia can be boiled down to a few points: — The law makes absentee voting harder. People must have a qualifying form of identification to vote by mail. The law also makes it harder to request and return an absentee ballot, restricting the period when people can apply for one and limiting the number of drop boxes where voters can return such a ballot in person. — On balance, it might make in-person voting easier, especially in the general election (though it contains provisions that cut in both directions). The law expands the number of required days of early voting, including on the weekend days that progressives covet (two Saturdays are now required instead of one). There’s also a provision that requires large precincts with long lines to add machines, add staff or split the precinct. Depending on how this is rolled out, it could be a big win for voters in Georgia’s urban areas, who have dealt with some of the longest lines in the country. Cutting in the other direction is the gratuitous and probably ineffectual limitation on handing out food and water to people standing in line to vote. Of more concrete but still limited importance is a rule that makes it harder for people to cast a provisional ballot if they show up at the wrong precinct. (It’s worth noting that many states don’t count these ballots at all, and there were only around 10,000 total provisional ballots in Georgia in the last election, including those cast in the right precinct). — It shortens the runoff period. Runoffs would be held four weeks after an initial election, instead of the nine weeks that had been in place for federal elections in the last few years. A main consequence would be to shorten early runoff voting to one week, instead of three, plausibly affecting turnout in exactly the kind of close, low-turnout race where it could easily be decisive. — It empowers the state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. It removes the secretary of state as chair of the state board of elections and allows the Legislature to appoint a majority of the board’s members, including the chair. And it empowers the state board to take over county boards of elections, if the circumstances merit it. These might prove to be very important. But for the purposes of this article, we are not considering them “voter suppression” provisions. They do not inherently make it harder for people to vote by restricting whether or how they can vote. If we leave aside the administrative provisions and the question of intent, the core question on voter suppression is to what extent does reducing voting options — like early voting in the runoffs or mail voting in general — reduce turnout and Democratic chances? The limited import of convenience voting For decades, reformers have assumed that the way to increase turnout is to make voting easier. Yet surprisingly, expanding voting options to make it more convenient hasn’t seemed to have a huge effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. That’s the finding of decades of political science research on advance, early and absentee voting. One prominent study even found that early voting decreases turnout, though that’s a bit of an outlier. There’s essentially no evidence that the vast expansion of no-excuse absentee mail voting, in which anyone can apply for a mail absentee ballot, had any discernible effect on turnout in 2020. That shouldn’t be a huge surprise: Even universal vote by mail, in which every registered voter is automatically sent a mail ballot (as opposed to every voter having an opportunity to apply for one), increases turnout by only about 2% with no discernible partisan advantage. Believe it or not, turnout increased just as much in the states that didn’t have no-excuse absentee voting as it did in the states that added it for the first time. Similarly, Joe Biden improved over Hillary Clinton’s performance by 3 percentage points in the states that added it, compared with 2.9 points in the states that did not. A more rigorous study by political scientists at Stanford found that no-excuse mail voting might have increased turnout by a whopping 0.02% in the 2020 election. The study used a novel approach: The researchers compared the turnout among 65-year-olds in Texas, who were eligible to vote by mail without an excuse, with 64-year-olds in Texas, who weren’t. The turnout among 64-year-olds was indistinguishable from that of 65-year-olds, even though the latter group voted by mail in large numbers. Like Georgia, Texas did not require an identification to vote by mail, but has a strict ID requirement for in-person voting. The partisan makeup of the electorate didn’t appear to change, either. The Democratic share of voters appeared to tick up by two-tenths of a percentage point — enough to decide a very close election. But it’s also so small that it could just be statistical noise, with no effect at all. Social science methods just don’t offer the level of precision necessary to nail down whether this, or any, change might move the needle by a tenth of a point. The Georgia law doesn’t come anywhere close to eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, unlike what the political scientists tested in Texas. As a result, one might expect the new law to have an even smaller effect. (You could make a counterintuitive argument that making absentee voting harder is worse for Democrats than eliminating it altogether, and that Democrats might be better off discouraging people from mail voting to avoid unnecessary ballot rejections of people who could have successfully voted in person.) The Georgia runoff elections, while hardly a scientific case study, nonetheless offer another useful example. There were fewer opportunities to vote in advance compared with the general election, because of the shorter election campaign and the holiday season. Based on the drop-off in early voting, many analysts wound up underestimating the final turnout by 20% or more. In the end, turnout exceeded expectations. The number of Election Day voters was higher than it was in the general election, as many people who might have voted early if it weren’t for Christmas or New Year’s Day now turned out on Election Day. Maybe runoff turnout would have been higher with the same early voting opportunities as in the general. But maybe not. And none of this had any discernible negative effect on the Democrats, who of course did better than they did in the general. Why doesn’t convenience matter? How is it possible that something like eliminating no-excuse absentee mail voting, a method beloved by millions of voters, wouldn’t materially affect turnout or election results? One simple answer is that convenience isn’t as important as often assumed. Almost everyone who cares enough to vote will brave the inconveniences of in-person voting to do so, whether that’s because the inconveniences aren’t really so great, or because they care enough to suffer them. This supposes a certain reasonable level of convenience, of course: Six-hour lines would change the calculation for many voters. And indeed, long lines do affect turnout. It also supposes a certain level of interest. Someone might think: There’s no way I’m waiting a half-hour in line to vote for dogcatcher. Similarly, the importance of a convenient voting option probably grows as the significance of a race decreases. The implication, though, is that nearly every person will manage to vote if sufficiently convenient options are available, even if the most preferred option doesn’t exist. That makes the Georgia election law’s effort to curb long lines potentially quite significant. Not only might it mitigate the already limited effect of restricting mail voting, but it might even outweigh it. Also, convenience voting may not be as convenient for lower-turnout voters, who essentially decide overall turnout. Low-turnout voters probably aren’t thinking about how they’ll vote a month ahead of the election, when they’ll need to apply for an absentee ballot. Someone thinking about this is probably a high-turnout voter. Low-turnout voters might not even know until Election Day whom they’ll support. And that makes them less likely to take advantage of advance voting options like no-excuse early voting, which requires them to think about the election early and often: to submit an application, fill out a ballot and return it. As a result, convenience voting methods tend to reinforce the socioeconomic biases favoring high-turnout voters. The methods ensure that every high-interest voter has many opportunities to vote, without doing quite as much to draw less engaged voters to the polls. Another reason is that voting restrictions may backfire by angering and energizing Democratic voters. This law’s restrictions on handing out water in line, for instance, may do more to mobilize Democrats than to stop them from voting. One recent study even theorized that the Supreme Court’s decision to roll back elements of the Voting Rights Act didn’t reduce Black turnout because subsequent efforts to restrict voting were swiftly countered by efforts to mobilize Black voters. That doesn’t mean the Georgia law or other such laws are without consequence. Many make voting more difficult, enough to intimidate or discourage some voters. Many outright disenfranchise voters, even if only in small numbers. Perhaps the disenfranchisement of even a single voter merits outrage and opposition, especially if the law is passed on dubious or even fabricated grounds, and with Jim Crow mass disenfranchisement as a historical backdrop. But setting aside intent, it does mean that many such voting provisions, like that in Georgia, are unlikely to have a huge effect on turnout or Democratic chances. There are consequences to misunderstanding the stakes of changing voting laws. Minor changes in voting access can overshadow larger issues, including the kinds of potentially significant provisions in the Georgia law that empower the state Legislature. The HR 1 bill passed in the U.S. House by Democrats on a near party-line vote, for instance, would do quite a bit to expand voting access but relatively little to protect against partisan interference in election administration. The perception that voting laws have existential stakes for democracy or the political viability of the two parties has made bipartisan compromise extremely difficult. The virtue of bipartisanship is often and understandably dismissed as naive, but voting laws are a rare case where bipartisanship has value of its own. Democracy, after all, depends on the consent of the loser. This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",

The Georgia law doesn’t come anywhere close to eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, unlike what the political scientists tested in Texas. As a result, one might expect the new law to have an even smaller effect. (You could make a counterintuitive argument that making absentee voting harder is worse for Democrats than eliminating it altogether, and that Democrats might be better off discouraging people from mail voting to avoid unnecessary ballot rejections of people who could have successfully voted in person.) The Georgia runoff elections, while hardly a scientific case study, nonetheless offer another useful example. There were fewer opportunities to vote in advance compared with the general election, because of the shorter election campaign and the holiday season. Based on the drop-off in early voting, many analysts wound up underestimating the final turnout by 20% or more. In the end, turnout exceeded expectations. The number of Election Day voters was higher than it was in the general election, as many people who might have voted early if it weren’t for Christmas or New Year’s Day now turned out on Election Day. Maybe runoff turnout would have been higher with the same early voting opportunities as in the general. But maybe not. And none of this had any discernible negative effect on the Democrats, who of course did better than they did in the general. Why doesn’t convenience matter? How is it possible that something like eliminating no-excuse absentee mail voting, a method beloved by millions of voters, wouldn’t materially affect turnout or election results? One simple answer is that convenience isn’t as important as often assumed. Almost everyone who cares enough to vote will brave the inconveniences of in-person voting to do so, whether that’s because the inconveniences aren’t really so great, or because they care enough to suffer them. This supposes a certain reasonable level of convenience, of course: Six-hour lines would change the calculation for many voters. And indeed, long lines do affect turnout. It also supposes a certain level of interest. Someone might think: There’s no way I’m waiting a half-hour in line to vote for dogcatcher. Similarly, the importance of a convenient voting option probably grows as the significance of a race decreases. The implication, though, is that nearly every person will manage to vote if sufficiently convenient options are available, even if the most preferred option doesn’t exist. That makes the Georgia election law’s effort to curb long lines potentially quite significant. Not only might it mitigate the already limited effect of restricting mail voting, but it might even outweigh it. Also, convenience voting may not be as convenient for lower-turnout voters, who essentially decide overall turnout. Low-turnout voters probably aren’t thinking about how they’ll vote a month ahead of the election, when they’ll need to apply for an absentee ballot. Someone thinking about this is probably a high-turnout voter. Low-turnout voters might not even know until Election Day whom they’ll support. And that makes them less likely to take advantage of advance voting options like no-excuse early voting, which requires them to think about the election early and often: to submit an application, fill out a ballot and return it. As a result, convenience voting methods tend to reinforce the socioeconomic biases favoring high-turnout voters. The methods ensure that every high-interest voter has many opportunities to vote, without doing quite as much to draw less engaged voters to the polls. Another reason is that voting restrictions may backfire by angering and energizing Democratic voters. This law’s restrictions on handing out water in line, for instance, may do more to mobilize Democrats than to stop them from voting. One recent study even theorized that the Supreme Court’s decision to roll back elements of the Voting Rights Act didn’t reduce Black turnout because subsequent efforts to restrict voting were swiftly countered by efforts to mobilize Black voters. That doesn’t mean the Georgia law or other such laws are without consequence. Many make voting more difficult, enough to intimidate or discourage some voters. Many outright disenfranchise voters, even if only in small numbers. Perhaps the disenfranchisement of even a single voter merits outrage and opposition, especially if the law is passed on dubious or even fabricated grounds, and with Jim Crow mass disenfranchisement as a historical backdrop. But setting aside intent, it does mean that many such voting provisions, like that in Georgia, are unlikely to have a huge effect on turnout or Democratic chances. There are consequences to misunderstanding the stakes of changing voting laws. Minor changes in voting access can overshadow larger issues, including the kinds of potentially significant provisions in the Georgia law that empower the state Legislature. The HR 1 bill passed in the U.S. House by Democrats on a near party-line vote, for instance, would do quite a bit to expand voting access but relatively little to protect against partisan interference in election administration. The perception that voting laws have existential stakes for democracy or the political viability of the two parties has made bipartisan compromise extremely difficult. The virtue of bipartisanship is often and understandably dismissed as naive, but voting laws are a rare case where bipartisanship has value of its own. Democracy, after all, depends on the consent of the loser. This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
One Republican's Lonely Fight Against a Flood of Disinformation,"Denver Riggleman, a Republican former congressman from Virginia, on his property in Afton, Va., on Friday, Feb. 19, 2021. (Matt Eich/The New York Times)

AFTON, Va. — Denver Riggleman stood virtually alone.

It was Oct. 2, on the floor of the House of Representatives, and he rose as one of only two Republicans in the chamber to speak in favor of a resolution denouncing QAnon. Riggleman, a freshman congressman from Virginia, had his own personal experiences with fringe ideas, both as a target of them and as a curious observer of the power they hold over true believers. He saw a dangerous movement becoming more intertwined with his party and worried that it was only growing thanks to words of encouragement from President Donald Trump.

“Will we stand up and condemn a dangerous, dehumanizing and convoluted conspiracy theory that the FBI has assessed with high confidence is very likely to motivate some domestic extremists?” asked Riggleman, a former Air Force intelligence officer. “We should not be playing with fire.”

Six months later, conspiracy theories like QAnon remain a threat that most Republicans would rather ignore than confront, and Riggleman is out of office. But he is ever more determined to try to expose disinformation from the far right that is swaying legions in the Republican base to believe in a false reality.

Riggleman is a living example of the political price of falling out of lock step with the hard right. He lost a GOP primary in June after he officiated at the wedding of a gay couple. And once he started calling out QAnon, whose followers assert that a satanic network of child molesters runs the Democratic Party, he received death threats and was attacked as a traitor, including by members of his own family.

The undoing of Riggleman — and now his unlikely crusade — is revealing about a dimension of conservative politics today. The fight against radicalism within the GOP is a deeply lonely one, waged mostly by Republicans like him who are no longer in office, and by the small handful of elected officials who have decided that they are willing to speak up even if it means that they, too, could be headed for an early retirement.

Story continues

“I’ve been telling people: ‘You don’t understand. This is getting worse, not better,’” Riggleman said, sitting on a stool at his family bar one recent afternoon. “People are angry. And they’re angry at the truth tellers.”

Riggleman, 51, is now back home in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where he and his wife run the bar and a distillery. And for his next move in a career that has included jobs at the National Security Agency and founding a military contracting business, he is working with a group of other experts to shine a light on what he calls the “social disease” of disinformation.

His experience with the issues and emotions at work is both professional and personal. He was so intrigued by false belief systems that he self-published a book about the myth of Bigfoot and the people who are unshakably devoted to it.

Riggleman, who first ran and won in 2018 after the Republican incumbent in his district retired, joined the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus and was endorsed by Trump.

Now he says it “gives me shivers” to be called a Republican. He hopes to show that there is still a way to beat back the lies and false beliefs that have spread from the fringe to the mainstream. It is a heavy lift, one that depends on overcoming two strong impulses: politicians’ fear of losing elections and people’s reluctance to accept that they were taken in by a lie.

Riggleman summarized his conversations with the 70% of House Republicans he said were privately appalled at the former president’s conduct but wouldn’t dare speak out.

“‘We couldn’t do that in our district. We would lose,’” he said. “That’s it. It’s that simple.”

Stocky, fast-talking and inexhaustibly curious, the former congressman is now working for a group of prominent experts and academics at the Network Contagion Research Institute, which studies the spread of disinformation in U.S. politics and how to thwart it. The group has undertaken several extensive investigations into how extremists have used propaganda and faked information to sow division over some of the most contentious issues of the day, like the coronavirus pandemic and police violence.

Their reports have also given lawmakers a better understanding of the QAnon belief system and other radical ideologies that helped fuel the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

Riggleman said he had written one report about the involvement of far-right militants and white supremacist groups in the attack specifically at the request of a Republican member who needed help convincing colleagues that far-left groups were not the culprits.

Getting lawmakers to see radical movements like QAnon as a threat has been difficult. Joel Finkelstein, the director of the Network Contagion Research Institute, said that in June, when the group tried to sound the alarm on QAnon to members of Congress, Riggleman was the only one who responded with a sense of urgency and agreed to help.

“We were screaming it from the rooftops,” Finkelstein said. “We said: ‘This is going to be a problem. They’re growing increasingly militant in their conspiracies.’” When the institute’s members spoke to Riggleman, he said, “We showed him our data and he said, ‘Holy moly.’”

Far from a theoretical or overblown concern, disinformation and its role in perpetuating false beliefs about Trump’s election loss and its aftermath are problems that some Republicans believe could cripple their party if left ignored.

In a sign of how widespread these conspiracy theories are, a recent poll from Suffolk University and USA Today found that 58% of Trump voters wrongly believed the storming of the Capitol was mostly inspired by far-left radicals associated with antifa and involved only a few Trump supporters.

“There was a troika of us who said, ‘This is going to a bad place,’” said Paul Mitchell, who represented Michigan in the House for two terms before retiring early this year in frustration.

He said he had watched as members dismissed Riggleman, despite his experience in intelligence.

“There weren’t many people who gave a damn what your expertise was,” Mitchell said. “It was inconsequential compared to the talking points.”

Riggleman’s loss last summer in a closely held party convention allowed him to be more outspoken. The winner, Rep. Bob Good, is a former associate athletic director at Liberty University who took issue with Riggleman’s officiation at the gay wedding and called him “out of step” with the party’s base.

And as Riggleman kept it up and spoke out more aggressively against Trump after the election, his fight got lonelier.

“I had a colleague of mine pat me on the shoulder and say: ‘Denver, you’re just too paranoid. You’re killing yourself for the rest of your life politically by going after the big man like this,’” Riggleman recalled.

When he returned to Virginia for good in January, he said he sometimes felt just as isolated. Family members, former constituents and patrons at the distillery insisted that the election had been stolen from Trump. And they couldn’t be talked out of it, no matter how hard he tried.

He recalled a recent conversation with one couple he is friends with that he said was especially exasperating.

“I go over stats,” he said. “I go over figures. I go over the 50 states, how that actually works. How machines that aren’t connected are very hard to hack. How you’d have to pay off hundreds of thousands of people to do this.”

“Did not convince them,” he added.

Other friends of his, some of whom are also members of the growing group of former Republican lawmakers now publicly criticizing Trump, said that many conservative politicians saw no incentive in trying to dispel disinformation even when they know it’s false.

“What some of these guys have told me privately is it’s still kind of self-preservation,” said Joe Walsh, a former congressman from Illinois who ran a short-lived primary campaign against Trump last year. “‘I want to hang onto the gig. And this is a fever; it will break.’”

That is mistaken, Walsh said, because he sees no breaking the spell that Trump has over Republican voters anytime soon.

“It’s done, and it was done a few years ago,” he said.

Riggleman, who is contemplating a run for governor in Virginia and is writing a book about his experience with the dark side of Republican politics, sees a way forward in his experience with Bigfoot. The sasquatch was how many people first learned about him as a politician, after an opponent accused him of harboring a fascination with “Bigfoot erotica,” in 2018.

“I do not dabble in monster porn,” he retorts in his book, “Bigfoot … It’s Complicated,” which he based in part on a trip he took in 2004 on a Bigfoot expedition.

The book is full of passages that, if pulled out and scrubbed of references to the mythical creature, could be describing politics in 2021.

Riggleman quotes one true believer explaining why he is absolutely convinced that Bigfoot is real, even though he has never seen it. In an answer that could have come straight from the lips of someone defending the myth that Trump actually won the 2020 election, the man says matter-of-factly: “Evidence is overwhelming. Check out the internet. All kinds of sightings and facts.”

At another point, Riggleman describes a conversation he had with someone who asked if he really thought that all the people claiming to have seen Bigfoot over the years were liars.

“I don’t think that,” Riggleman responds. “I do believe that people see what they want to see.”

He did find one way to crack the Bigfoot false belief system: telling true believers that they were being ripped off to the tune of hundreds or thousands of dollars to go on expeditions where they would never actually see the creature.

“They got very angry,” he said.

But eventually, some started to come around.

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Kerry: U.S. 'hopeful' it can work with China to tackle climate change,"National Review

‘Academic politics is the most vicious and bitter form of politics, because the stakes are so low.” So said Wallace Stanley Sayre of Columbia University way back in the early 1950s — another reminder that the cultural conditions for the decay and debasement of the 1960s began to bubble up in the immediate post-war era and were not the result of a contagion imported into the United States with the Beatles. Democratic culture in the United States ensures that the middle classes adopt the worst habits of the upper classes, and, having subjected the national political discourse to the manners of the faculty lounge, Americans now are not quite sure how to handle themselves when the stakes are something other than low. Here is a question for you: When you consider the outrage theater on social media and on cable news, when you hear Americans who claim to believe that the culture that made a millionaire of Pooh Shiesty operates as a white-supremacist conspiracy or that American politics is dominated by a secret cabal set into motion by Antonio Gramsci a century ago, when you encounter people who claim with absolute metaphysical certitude that mentioning the fact that a certain famous Justin Bieber impersonator used to be called Ellen is in some ineffable way a literal act of violence, when you talk with people who insist that either “patriarchy” or “cultural Marxism” or capital or “cosmopolitan globalism” lurks secretly in every dark corner, that one of these or some other fresh new phlogiston of the moment explains everything . . . do you not think, as I do, that in reality something else is going on? Perhaps it seems to you, as it seems to me, that these conversations are not really about what everybody is pretending they are about. Instead, they result from the fact that we feel compelled to seek out ever more ludicrous ways (Intersectionalism! Integralism! Nationalism!) to reconfigure the high-stakes questions as low-stakes questions, as though we could miniaturize the moral universe in the form of a dispute about pronoun etiquette or aluminum tariffs or dissident bakers in Colorado. The high-stakes questions don’t go away simply because we ignore them. There is a certain kind of debunking mind that relishes “exposing” things that generally well-educated people already know, especially when those things have to do with Christianity, which was until the day before yesterday the main current in Western thought. You know the type: Ho, ho! Don’t you know that Christmas is a barely dressed-up Saturnalia and that St. Brigid was a Celtic goddess before she was a Christian saint? Ever notice that after church on Easter so many of those Bible-believing Christians conduct an ancient pagan fertility ceremony involving sacred rabbits and egg-worship? Etc. I suppose that sort of thing is disturbing to a certain kind of Christian — the easily disturbed kind — but most people understand that the story of human history is that we move around, and bump into and rub off on one another in the process. Of course the early Christians borrowed from the Romans. And the Romans borrowed from the Greeks, the Greeks from the Egyptians, the Egyptians from the Nubians and the Syrians, and so on back into the darkest shadows of antiquity. In the case of Christianity, it would have been more remarkable if a religion born in the Roman Empire hadn’t borne the imprint of Roman culture. But what those same debunkers so often fail to appreciate is that the secular West and the post-Christian world have been busily reinventing the same rites and rituals that have been with us since the beginning of human civilization, often in the shape of barely disguised repurposing of familiar Christian forms. E.g.: Both Christian conversions and gender conversions are characterized by “confirmations” that are part of an extended social ritual in which a person often chooses a special name and leaves behind the old identity while being presented to the community under the new identity. Saint Paul insisted that the old man must die so that the new one might live in salvation, and his epigones go so far as to observe a taboo against even mentioning the old man (“deadnaming”). The social and the religious overlap: Victorian debutantes were “coming out” a long time before Lil Nas X did. (And surely his was the least-surprising coming-out of a pop singer since Rob Halford’s.) Adopting distinctive dietary restrictions was a common form of spiritual observance long before American progressives declared war on gluten and animal products. Donald Trump was not the first guy to put on a ceremonial red hat and declare himself God’s man on the ground. Ritual genital mutilation as a rite of passage did not begin at the Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender Health. From veganism to pronoun magic, these quasi-religious phenomena represent quests for meaning and understanding in new forms. If people in our time urgently feel the necessity to seek out new forms of meaning and understanding, it is because they have lost touch with the old ones. And if the new ones have produced despair and chaos rather than fulfillment and order, we might consider what there is to be learned from that. Today is Good Friday. No one is really sure why we call it good. It may be from good in its fading sense of pious or holy (“the good friar,” “good tidings” at Christmas), or it may be a corruption of the German phrase Gottes Freitag, or “God’s Friday.” Given the brutality of the events commemorated on Good Friday, calling it “good” feels a little strange to the modern ear. The old Anglo-Saxons called the Friday before Easter “Long Friday,” as do the modern Danes (Langfredag) and Swedes (Långfredagen). And though Long Friday observances are solemn and often uncomfortable, they may not be long enough. We could stand to spend a little longer meditating on the events in question, in which the stakes are very high, indeed — the highest, in fact: As Richard John Neuhaus wrote in his great, brief Death on a Friday Afternoon, if what Christians say about Good Friday is true, then that, and none of our contemporary alternatives, is the truth about everything. The high-stakes game is different from the more common one, because love is different from niceness and because truth is different from “my truth.” The point of understanding the real stakes of the game is not to improve our manners or even our public morality, much less to reform the state of our political affairs and our democratic discourse. All of those improvements may be worthy and desirable, and they may follow naturally from that understanding, but they are only subordinate ends. The truth is not the truth because it makes us better citizens — the truth is the truth because it is the truth. And the truth of Good Friday is this: The Cross is not the end of the story, but there is no way to the Resurrection except through it. If that is your starting point, then there are still many directions you can go from there, but all your possible paths lead back to the same place. It is a world that has a center. Quoting from the Gospel according to Mark, Abraham Lincoln said: “A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.” The question that plagued Lincoln was settled — in blood — at Gettysburg and immediately thereafter. But this house remains divided, and the real divide — the high-stakes divide — is not red vs. blue. Red vs. blue is only a proxy for a larger, comprehensive confrontation that is in its minor aspects political and cultural and in its major aspect spiritual — which is to say, religious. (Let us never hear again from those delusional souls who proclaim themselves “spiritual, but not religious.” Of course you follow a religion, even if it is a hokey and low-rent one of which you are not consciously aware. Everybody sees it except you.) And though I do not expect exceptionless uniformity of opinion among individuals, I think Lincoln had it about right: This country will become, to some predominating degree, all one thing or all the other. Good Friday points the way toward one possibility. The signposts pointing the way to the other possibility are everywhere around you to be seen.",
"Georgia's Election Law, and Why Turnout Isn't Easy to Turn Off","Voters wait in line at a polling place at the Agnes Scott College campus in Decatur, Ga., Oct. 12, 2020. (Nicole Craine/The New York Times)

There’s nothing unusual about exaggeration in politics. But when it comes to the debate over voting rights, something more than exaggeration is going on.

There’s a real — and bipartisan — misunderstanding about whether making it easier or harder to vote, especially by mail, has a significant effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. The evidence suggests it does not.

The fight over the new Georgia election law is only the latest example. That law, passed last week, has been condemned by Democrats as voter suppression, or even as tantamount to Jim Crow.

Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times

Democrats are understandably concerned about a provision that empowers the Republican-controlled state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. That provision has uncertain but potentially substantial effects, depending on what the Legislature might do in the future. And it’s possible the law is intended to do exactly what progressives fear: reshape the electorate to the advantage of Republicans, soon after an electoral defeat, by making it harder to vote.

And yet the law’s voting provisions are unlikely to significantly affect turnout or Democratic chances. It could plausibly even increase turnout. In the final account, it will probably be hard to say whether it had any effect on turnout at all.

The Georgia law

The Georgia can be boiled down to a few points:

— The law makes absentee voting harder. People must have a qualifying form of identification to vote by mail. The law also makes it harder to request and return an absentee ballot, restricting the period when people can apply for one and limiting the number of drop boxes where voters can return such a ballot in person.

— On balance, it might make in-person voting easier, especially in the general election (though it contains provisions that cut in both directions).

The law expands the number of required days of early voting, including on the weekend days that progressives covet (two Saturdays are now required instead of one). There’s also a provision that requires large precincts with long lines to add machines, add staff or split the precinct. Depending on how this is rolled out, it could be a big win for voters in Georgia’s urban areas, who have dealt with some of the longest lines in the country.

Story continues

Cutting in the other direction is the gratuitous and probably ineffectual limitation on handing out food and water to people standing in line to vote. Of more concrete but still limited importance is a rule that makes it harder for people to cast a provisional ballot if they show up at the wrong precinct. (It’s worth noting that many states don’t count these ballots at all, and there were only around 10,000 total provisional ballots in Georgia in the last election, including those cast in the right precinct).

— It shortens the runoff period. Runoffs would be held four weeks after an initial election, instead of the nine weeks that had been in place for federal elections in the last few years. A main consequence would be to shorten early runoff voting to one week, instead of three, plausibly affecting turnout in exactly the kind of close, low-turnout race where it could easily be decisive.

— It empowers the state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. It removes the secretary of state as chair of the state board of elections and allows the Legislature to appoint a majority of the board’s members, including the chair. And it empowers the state board to take over county boards of elections, if the circumstances merit it.

These might prove to be very important. But for the purposes of this article, we are not considering them “voter suppression” provisions. They do not inherently make it harder for people to vote by restricting whether or how they can vote.

If we leave aside the administrative provisions and the question of intent, the core question on voter suppression is to what extent does reducing voting options — like early voting in the runoffs or mail voting in general — reduce turnout and Democratic chances?

The limited import of convenience voting

For decades, reformers have assumed that the way to increase turnout is to make voting easier.

Yet surprisingly, expanding voting options to make it more convenient hasn’t seemed to have a huge effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. That’s the finding of decades of political science research on advance, early and absentee voting. One prominent study even found that early voting decreases turnout, though that’s a bit of an outlier.

There’s essentially no evidence that the vast expansion of no-excuse absentee mail voting, in which anyone can apply for a mail absentee ballot, had any discernible effect on turnout in 2020. That shouldn’t be a huge surprise: Even universal vote by mail, in which every registered voter is automatically sent a mail ballot (as opposed to every voter having an opportunity to apply for one), increases turnout by only about 2% with no discernible partisan advantage.

Believe it or not, turnout increased just as much in the states that didn’t have no-excuse absentee voting as it did in the states that added it for the first time. Similarly, Joe Biden improved over Hillary Clinton’s performance by 3 percentage points in the states that added it, compared with 2.9 points in the states that did not.

A more rigorous study by political scientists at Stanford found that no-excuse mail voting might have increased turnout by a whopping 0.02% in the 2020 election. The study used a novel approach: The researchers compared the turnout among 65-year-olds in Texas, who were eligible to vote by mail without an excuse, with 64-year-olds in Texas, who weren’t. The turnout among 64-year-olds was indistinguishable from that of 65-year-olds, even though the latter group voted by mail in large numbers.

Like Georgia, Texas did not require an identification to vote by mail, but has a strict ID requirement for in-person voting.

The partisan makeup of the electorate didn’t appear to change, either. The Democratic share of voters appeared to tick up by two-tenths of a percentage point — enough to decide a very close election. But it’s also so small that it could just be statistical noise, with no effect at all. Social science methods just don’t offer the level of precision necessary to nail down whether this, or any, change might move the needle by a tenth of a point.

The Georgia law doesn’t come anywhere close to eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, unlike what the political scientists tested in Texas. As a result, one might expect the new law to have an even smaller effect. (You could make a counterintuitive argument that making absentee voting harder is worse for Democrats than eliminating it altogether, and that Democrats might be better off discouraging people from mail voting to avoid unnecessary ballot rejections of people who could have successfully voted in person.)

The Georgia runoff elections, while hardly a scientific case study, nonetheless offer another useful example. There were fewer opportunities to vote in advance compared with the general election, because of the shorter election campaign and the holiday season. Based on the drop-off in early voting, many analysts wound up underestimating the final turnout by 20% or more. In the end, turnout exceeded expectations. The number of Election Day voters was higher than it was in the general election, as many people who might have voted early if it weren’t for Christmas or New Year’s Day now turned out on Election Day.

Maybe runoff turnout would have been higher with the same early voting opportunities as in the general. But maybe not. And none of this had any discernible negative effect on the Democrats, who of course did better than they did in the general.

Why doesn’t convenience matter?

How is it possible that something like eliminating no-excuse absentee mail voting, a method beloved by millions of voters, wouldn’t materially affect turnout or election results?

One simple answer is that convenience isn’t as important as often assumed. Almost everyone who cares enough to vote will brave the inconveniences of in-person voting to do so, whether that’s because the inconveniences aren’t really so great, or because they care enough to suffer them.

This supposes a certain reasonable level of convenience, of course: Six-hour lines would change the calculation for many voters. And indeed, long lines do affect turnout. It also supposes a certain level of interest. Someone might think: There’s no way I’m waiting a half-hour in line to vote for dogcatcher. Similarly, the importance of a convenient voting option probably grows as the significance of a race decreases.

The implication, though, is that nearly every person will manage to vote if sufficiently convenient options are available, even if the most preferred option doesn’t exist. That makes the Georgia election law’s effort to curb long lines potentially quite significant. Not only might it mitigate the already limited effect of restricting mail voting, but it might even outweigh it.

Also, convenience voting may not be as convenient for lower-turnout voters, who essentially decide overall turnout. Low-turnout voters probably aren’t thinking about how they’ll vote a month ahead of the election, when they’ll need to apply for an absentee ballot. Someone thinking about this is probably a high-turnout voter. Low-turnout voters might not even know until Election Day whom they’ll support. And that makes them less likely to take advantage of advance voting options like no-excuse early voting, which requires them to think about the election early and often: to submit an application, fill out a ballot and return it.

As a result, convenience voting methods tend to reinforce the socioeconomic biases favoring high-turnout voters. The methods ensure that every high-interest voter has many opportunities to vote, without doing quite as much to draw less engaged voters to the polls.

Another reason is that voting restrictions may backfire by angering and energizing Democratic voters. This law’s restrictions on handing out water in line, for instance, may do more to mobilize Democrats than to stop them from voting. One recent study even theorized that the Supreme Court’s decision to roll back elements of the Voting Rights Act didn’t reduce Black turnout because subsequent efforts to restrict voting were swiftly countered by efforts to mobilize Black voters.

That doesn’t mean the Georgia law or other such laws are without consequence. Many make voting more difficult, enough to intimidate or discourage some voters. Many outright disenfranchise voters, even if only in small numbers. Perhaps the disenfranchisement of even a single voter merits outrage and opposition, especially if the law is passed on dubious or even fabricated grounds, and with Jim Crow mass disenfranchisement as a historical backdrop.

But setting aside intent, it does mean that many such voting provisions, like that in Georgia, are unlikely to have a huge effect on turnout or Democratic chances.

There are consequences to misunderstanding the stakes of changing voting laws. Minor changes in voting access can overshadow larger issues, including the kinds of potentially significant provisions in the Georgia law that empower the state Legislature. The HR 1 bill passed in the U.S. House by Democrats on a near party-line vote, for instance, would do quite a bit to expand voting access but relatively little to protect against partisan interference in election administration.

The perception that voting laws have existential stakes for democracy or the political viability of the two parties has made bipartisan compromise extremely difficult. The virtue of bipartisanship is often and understandably dismissed as naive, but voting laws are a rare case where bipartisanship has value of its own. Democracy, after all, depends on the consent of the loser.

Deadly breach could delay decisions about Capitol fencing,"The New York Times

There’s nothing unusual about exaggeration in politics. But when it comes to the debate over voting rights, something more than exaggeration is going on. There’s a real — and bipartisan — misunderstanding about whether making it easier or harder to vote, especially by mail, has a significant effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. The evidence suggests it does not. The fight over the new Georgia election law is only the latest example. That law, passed last week, has been condemned by Democrats as voter suppression, or even as tantamount to Jim Crow. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Democrats are understandably concerned about a provision that empowers the Republican-controlled state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. That provision has uncertain but potentially substantial effects, depending on what the Legislature might do in the future. And it’s possible the law is intended to do exactly what progressives fear: reshape the electorate to the advantage of Republicans, soon after an electoral defeat, by making it harder to vote. And yet the law’s voting provisions are unlikely to significantly affect turnout or Democratic chances. It could plausibly even increase turnout. In the final account, it will probably be hard to say whether it had any effect on turnout at all. The Georgia law The Georgia can be boiled down to a few points: — The law makes absentee voting harder. People must have a qualifying form of identification to vote by mail. The law also makes it harder to request and return an absentee ballot, restricting the period when people can apply for one and limiting the number of drop boxes where voters can return such a ballot in person. — On balance, it might make in-person voting easier, especially in the general election (though it contains provisions that cut in both directions). The law expands the number of required days of early voting, including on the weekend days that progressives covet (two Saturdays are now required instead of one). There’s also a provision that requires large precincts with long lines to add machines, add staff or split the precinct. Depending on how this is rolled out, it could be a big win for voters in Georgia’s urban areas, who have dealt with some of the longest lines in the country. Cutting in the other direction is the gratuitous and probably ineffectual limitation on handing out food and water to people standing in line to vote. Of more concrete but still limited importance is a rule that makes it harder for people to cast a provisional ballot if they show up at the wrong precinct. (It’s worth noting that many states don’t count these ballots at all, and there were only around 10,000 total provisional ballots in Georgia in the last election, including those cast in the right precinct). — It shortens the runoff period. Runoffs would be held four weeks after an initial election, instead of the nine weeks that had been in place for federal elections in the last few years. A main consequence would be to shorten early runoff voting to one week, instead of three, plausibly affecting turnout in exactly the kind of close, low-turnout race where it could easily be decisive. — It empowers the state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. It removes the secretary of state as chair of the state board of elections and allows the Legislature to appoint a majority of the board’s members, including the chair. And it empowers the state board to take over county boards of elections, if the circumstances merit it. These might prove to be very important. But for the purposes of this article, we are not considering them “voter suppression” provisions. They do not inherently make it harder for people to vote by restricting whether or how they can vote. If we leave aside the administrative provisions and the question of intent, the core question on voter suppression is to what extent does reducing voting options — like early voting in the runoffs or mail voting in general — reduce turnout and Democratic chances? The limited import of convenience voting For decades, reformers have assumed that the way to increase turnout is to make voting easier. Yet surprisingly, expanding voting options to make it more convenient hasn’t seemed to have a huge effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. That’s the finding of decades of political science research on advance, early and absentee voting. One prominent study even found that early voting decreases turnout, though that’s a bit of an outlier. There’s essentially no evidence that the vast expansion of no-excuse absentee mail voting, in which anyone can apply for a mail absentee ballot, had any discernible effect on turnout in 2020. That shouldn’t be a huge surprise: Even universal vote by mail, in which every registered voter is automatically sent a mail ballot (as opposed to every voter having an opportunity to apply for one), increases turnout by only about 2% with no discernible partisan advantage. Believe it or not, turnout increased just as much in the states that didn’t have no-excuse absentee voting as it did in the states that added it for the first time. Similarly, Joe Biden improved over Hillary Clinton’s performance by 3 percentage points in the states that added it, compared with 2.9 points in the states that did not. A more rigorous study by political scientists at Stanford found that no-excuse mail voting might have increased turnout by a whopping 0.02% in the 2020 election. The study used a novel approach: The researchers compared the turnout among 65-year-olds in Texas, who were eligible to vote by mail without an excuse, with 64-year-olds in Texas, who weren’t.

Congress' most effective lawmakers aren't generally its household names,"Despite high approval ratingsor wide popularity, well-known members of Congress are not the most effective lawmakers, according to a report from the Center for Effective Lawmaking.

The center recently released its effectiveness scores for members of the 116th Congress, which ran from Jan. 3, 2019, to Jan. 3, 2021. The bottom line: The lawmakers often in the news — particularly from the House of Representatives — aren't generally the ones sponsoring bills that make significant headway through Congress or making substantial policy proposals. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is one exception.

Through a partnership between the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy and Vanderbilt University, the Center for Effective Lawmaking, created in 2017, aims to understand and communicate the effectiveness of lawmakers and the congressional legislative process.

“We’re the Center for Effective Lawmaking, so we’re particularly interested in the lawmaking component of what members of Congress do, so we set aside oversite and constituency services and so on,” said Craig Volden, the co-director of the Center for Effective Lawmaking. “In that lawmaking space, we've generated the legislative effectiveness scores.”

The Capitol is seen at dusk as work in the Senate is stalled on the Democrats' $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, in Washington, Friday, March 5, 2021.

There are four lists of top 10 most effective lawmakers, one for each political party in each chamber of Congress. The topmost effective House member for each party was Reps. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., and Michael McCaul, R-Texas, topped the House lists, while Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., took the No. 1 spots in the Senate were the topmost effective senators in the chamber for their respective parties.

“We’ve found initial patterns that those more effective tend to be what we would call the workhorses rather than the show horses, and because of their policy focus, they’re less likely to be called upon by the media,” said Volden.

“We’ve kind of relatedly found that those who are called on by the media, that there tends to be more of an interest in talking about ... politicking and personalities than there is in talking about policy and lawmaking.”

How legislative effectiveness scores are determined

Legislative effectiveness scores are determined through a combination of 15 different metrics, including how many bills a lawmaker sponsors, how far the bill goes through Congress and how substantial or significant the bill is.

Lawmakers scores are a weighted average of the five stages of the lawmaking process and three levels of bill significance, where lawmakers can get downgraded for commemorative bills and upgraded for more “substantive and significant bills,” Volden said.

“When we talk about (lawmakers) introducing bills into the U.S. House or Senate, we're only looking at public bills, meaning those that actually make their way through both chambers and assigned to law; actually have the power to change U.S. code essentially,” said Alan Wiseman, the co-director of the Center for Effective Lawmaking. “We're not focusing on resolutions.”

Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) on Feb. 23, 2021, in Washington, D.C.

According to the center, Rubio sponsored a total of 103 substantive bills, with five of them becoming law.

“It is a great honor to have been named the most effective Republican lawmaker in the Senate. I believe in the work I have done and continue to do for the state of Florida and for our nation. I am committed to protecting America’s economic and national security, and will work with anyone, regardless of party, who shares those goals,” Rubio told USA TODAY in a statement.

Peters sponsored 84 substantive bills, with a total of 14 of them passing through Congress and becoming law.

“Michiganders expect us to get things done for them – and that’s always been my focus. I’m proud to be recognized as the most effective senator and for passing legislation on issues impacting Michiganders,” Peters said in a statement about his effectiveness score. “I will continue working to bring people together to solve challenges facing our state and nation.”

Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., speaks at a hearing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, March 25, 2021, in Washington.

Because whether a lawmaker is in the majority or minority party significantly impacts their legislative effectiveness score, the center doesn’t rank the Congress as a whole, calling it “inappropriate.” Instead the center ranks each party in each chamber, which is why there are four topmost effective lawmakers lists.

Household names aren't among most effective

To compare lawmakers' effectiveness versus popularity, a Morning Consult poll on approval ratings for lawmakers from late 2019 offers insight on the difference between popular lawmakers and the most effective ones.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-V.t., John Thune, R-S.D., and Chris Coons, D-Del., were among the top 10 most popular senators at the end of 2019, according to a Morning Consult poll, which surveyed more than 490,000 registered voters. Yet none was among the Center for Effective Lawmaking's top 10 most effective lawmakers for the 116th Congress..

Based on their legislative effectiveness score, Thune was ranked No. 24 out of 54 Senate Republicans, while Coons was ranked No. 32 out of 45 Senate Democrats.

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y) and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) stand together during his campaign event at the Whittemore Center Arena on Feb. 10, 2020 in Durham, N.H.

Lawmakers who are more frequently mentioned by news or social media outlets than others, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, are not ranked high on the effectiveness list. Ocasio-Cortez is ranked No. 230 and Pelosi No. 237 out of the 240 House Democrats, while Jordan ranked No. 202 out of 205 House Republicans.

Sens. Richard Shelby, R-Al., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., were ranked the least effective senators in their respected parties, while Reps. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., and Kay Grander, R-Texas, were named the least effective lawmakers in the House for their parties.

Along with an effectiveness score, each member also gets a benchmark score, which shows how an average lawmaker with the same seniority in the same position does. Members of the majority party, committee chairs and more senior members of Congress tend to score higher for effectiveness.

Changes in effectiveness from past years

While the Center for Effective Lawmaking's main purpose of the scores is to assess lawmakers' effectiveness, the scores also show trends, allowing the center to make conclusions about the state of Congress.

Based on the scores, the center found that the 116th Congress' committee and subcommittee chairs weren’t ranked as high as past chairs. Usually, they rank near the top of the lists.

“One way to think about that is the gap between an average member and a committee chair or subcommittee chair is narrowing substantially, and that’s a lot of evidence that policymaking isn’t being done in the committees and subcommittees as much as it used to be,” Volden said. “One clear takeaway is kind of the declining power of committees, as mostly party leaders want to handle most of the construction of the most major pieces of legislation themselves or outside of the committee process.”

The center also found that Democrats within the Senate as the minority party were more engaged in the lawmaking process than expected. According to Volden, Democratic senators introduced an average of 60 bills during the 116th Congress, compared to an average of 40 during the 115th Congress.

Democrats in the Senate were also able to get enough Republicans to vote with them to get their bills into law “at a rate we have not seen across the past 50 years,” Volden added.

“It’s important to recognize that only two of those bills were bills that we would note as commemorative measures, so it’s not the case that the Democratic senators were so successful because they were just introducing lots of legislative,” Wiseman said. “These were substantive pieces of legislation that found their way through lawmakers. They were successfully navigating the lawmaking process despite being in the minority party.”

Senator Joe Manchin leaves a briefing in Washington, DC., on March 10, 2020.

Of the 119 bills introduced into the Senate and passed into law, 48 of them were sponsored by Democrats.

A bill to improve safety and security for the Veterans Act of 2019 introduced by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., and one to extend the Medicaid mental health services demonstration program for two weeks, introduced by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are among the 48 bills that became law.

Trump on the ballot again? Daughter-in-law Lara ponders Senate run,"Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The Trump flags and yard signs are still up. Flags that shout “Impeach Biden” fly on the back of pickup trucks. “Most people here believe Donald Trump is still the president,” says Nancy Allen of her neighborhood in Shelby, North Carolina. “And I call him President Trump.”

Allen might get the chance to vote Trump again sooner than expected. But it will not be for Donald or his politically ambitious daughter Ivanka. Instead the former president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native, is considering a run for the US Senate next year.

“If she decides to run, I will campaign for her,” added Allen, 74, who used to run a business in Wilmington, where Lara Trump (née Yunaska) was born and raised and where her parents still live. “She’s very approachable: it’s amazing that she’s just like one of us. She has no airs about her at all. She’s a people’s person.

“She is well known all across the state, which is very important, and I think she is good and she would win. Henry, my husband, said yesterday that it would be a landslide if if she ran.”

Lara, 38, a former TV producer who has also worked as a chef and personal trainer, married Eric Trump at his father’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2014. Since becoming a member of the family, she has displayed the zeal of the convert and proved an ardent champion of the “Make America great again” movement.

Lara played up her local roots when addressing rallies for the president in North Carolina and her bio on Twitter, where she amassed 1.2m followers, says simply: “NC girl in NYC #MAGA.” She also led Women for Trump events, hosted numerous campaign video streams and, after her father-in-law’s defeat, unabashedly pushed false claims of voter fraud.

She told Sean Hannity, a host on the conservative Fox News network, on 5 December: “I want to make it very clear to the American people: this is not over. So don’t for a second think that Joe Biden is going to be sworn in on January 20th.”

Story continues

This week Lara returned to the spotlight in more ways than one. She conducted Trump’s first on-camera interview since leaving the White House on her online show The Right View, but the conversation was removed from Facebook and Instagram because he has been banned from those platforms for incendiary comments.

It also emerged that Lara is joining Fox News as a paid on-air contributor – a potential boost to her political brand ahead of a possible run for the Senate seat in North Carolina to be vacated next year by retiring Republican Richard Burr. She told the Fox & Friends programme on Monday that she has not “officially made a decision, but hopefully sometime soon”.

Such a move would require her to sever ties with Fox News, according to the network’s policy. It would also represent the first electoral test of the Trump name since 2020 and underline how the former president’s children and their partners have emerged as some of his most influential allies and surrogates.

Don Jr’s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News presenter, campaigned vigorously for the president and went viral with a Republican national convention address that ended with a crescendo: “The best is yet to come!” Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, served a senior White House adviser with a portfolio so sprawling that it was ridiculed by critics.

The surprise, perhaps, is that the first standard-bearer would be Lara rather than Ivanka, who amid much speculation has ruled out a run for the Senate in Florida.

Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “She would be what I think Donald Trump hoped Ivanka would be. She would become the avatar for the Trump family name. She looks like a Trump, she talks like a Trump.

“Every president has wanted his children or grandchildren to run for office for a long time. Trump is no different. This is a daughter-in-law, but it doesn’t matter, and we’ll see. Maybe she can do whatever Ivanka can’t do and appeal to suburban college educated women who defected from Trump.”

How Lara fares in at the ballot box could also offer clues to the presidential election, Schiller added, even if Donald Trump himself decides not to run again. “By Lara Trump running in North Carolina, the Trump brand get tested and, if she’s successful, that’s an indication that the Trump brand might do well in 2024 in the presidential race, which may lead to pushing Don Jr out there to run for president.

“There are a lot of other people who want to run for president in the Republican party in 2024. You’re going to see a very complicated dance between prominent Republicans and the Trump children and Trump himself in the next two years because they want his support but they do not want them to get too successful because that will crowd them all out.”

There is no guarantee that Lara would win a Republican primary where the Trump name might turn from asset into liability. Rivals could include Mark Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina who became Trump’s chief of staff. Burr, the outgoing senator, voted in favour of convicting Trump at his impeachment trial following the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol.

Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “There are going to be other candidates on the Republican side in North Carolina and some of them are going to both claim loyalty to Donald Trump to try to neutralise that but also suggest to voters that they have a better chance of beating a fairly competitive Democratic candidate come the general election.

“Because one thing we know about Donald Trump - and this will be part of the political genetics here – is that he’s a turnoff for independents.”

Trump won North Carolina by just 1.3% against Joe Biden, significantly less than his margin in 2016. Democrats hope that the state can trend in the same direction as Georgia and Virginia, where anti-Trump resistance was a rallying point.

Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist based in South Carolina who works in North Carolina frequently, said: “The demographics of North Carolina still would give us real possibilities, real opportunities to do the unthinkable, just like we did in Georgia in January.

“I think that the timing is right, the environment is right and Republicans are going to have a fight on their hands that they did not expect for that Senate seat. The same way Georgia was key to the Senate in the 2020 cycle, I think North Carolina will be just as key for the 2022 cycle.”",
Pressure mounts on corporations to denounce GOP voting bills,"ATLANTA (AP) — Liberal activists are stepping up calls for corporate America to denounce Republican efforts to tighten state voting laws, and businesses accustomed to cozy political relationships now find themselves in the middle of a growing partisan fight over voting rights.

Pressure is mounting on leading companies in Texas, Arizona and other states, particularly after Major League Baseball’s decision Friday to move the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta. A joint statement from executives at nearly 200 companies, including HP, Microsoft, PayPal, Target, Twitter, Uber and Under Armour, took aim at state legislation “threatening to make voting more difficult"" and said “elections are not improved” when lawmakers impose new barriers to voting.

The outcry comes a week after Georgia Republicans enacted an overhaul of the state's election law that critics argue is an attempt to suppress Democratic votes.

Other companies have, somewhat belatedly, joined the chorus of critics.

Delta Air Lines and The Coca-Cola Co., two of Georgia’s best-known brands, this past week called the new law “unacceptable,"" although they had a hand in writing it. That only angered Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp and several U.S. senators, who accused the companies of cowering from unwarranted attacks from the left.

The fight has thrust corporate America into a place it often tries to avoid — the center of a partisan political fight. But under threat of boycott and bad publicity, business leaders are showing a new willingness to enter the fray on an issue not directly related to their bottom line, even if it means alienating Republican allies.

“We want to hold corporations accountable for how they show up when voting rights are under attack,” said Marc Banks, an NAACP spokesman. “Corporations have a part to play, because when they do show up and speak, people listen.”

Kemp said at a news conference Saturday that baseball “caved to fear and lies from liberal activists” and moving the game means ”cancel culture” is coming for American businesses. Kemp said state leaders worked in good faith with leaders in the business community on the legislation, including some of the same companies that have now “flip-flopped on this issue.” He added: “We shouldn’t apologize for making it easy to vote and hard to cheat.""

Civil rights groups have sued to block the new Georgia law, which was passed after Democrats flipped the once-reliably Republican state in an election that Donald Trump falsely claimed was rife with fraud. Some activists have called for consumer boycotts of Delta, Coca-Cola and others. They dismiss business leaders’ assertions that they helped water down the bill to ease earlier, more restrictive proposals; those leaders, they argue, should have tried to block the plan altogether.

In Texas, the NAACP, League of Women Voters and League of United Latin American Citizens, among other organizations, are urging corporations in the state to speak out against a slate of Republican-backed voting proposals. “Democracy is good for business,” the campaign says.

Nine organizations took out full-page ads in The Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News, the state’s leading newspapers, urging corporate opposition to the plan. The Texas proposal would limit some early voting hours, bar counties from setting up drive-thru voting and prohibit local officials from proactively sending applications for mail ballots before voters request them.

Unlike their Georgia-based counterparts, American Airlines and Dell Technologies didn’t wait for the Texas measure to pass. “To make American’s stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,” American said in a statement.

Arizona, which Biden flipped from Trump in November, hasn’t seen high-profile corporate players engage yet. But 30-plus groups sent a joint letter to Allstate Insurance, CVS Health and Farmers’ Insurance, among others, urging their public opposition to proposed voting restrictions. Emily Kirkland, executive director of Progress Arizona, a progressive group that signed the letter, said there's been no response yet.

Other groups are demanding that corporations focus on Washington, where congressional Democrats are pushing measures intended to make it easier for Americans to vote, regardless of state laws. Among the changes, Democrats would enact automatic voter registration nationally and standardize access to early and mail voting.

Democrats also want to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that require the federal government to approve all election procedures in states and locales with a history of discrimination. The Supreme Court struck down those provisions, which applied to Georgia and Arizona, among other states, in 2013.

Corporate giants were mostly quiet when Trump falsely claimed he lost because of fraud. Business leaders largely maintained that caution as Republican state lawmakers used Trump's lie to justify a flood of new bills to make it more cumbersome to vote.

The reticence was a stark contrast to how chambers of commerce reacted six years ago when Republican-run states pushed “religious freedom” measures. Indiana, under then-Gov. Mike Pence, the future vice president, saw immediate corporate backlash. After North Carolina passed a “bathroom bill” limiting LGBTQ rights in 2016, PayPal scuttled expansion plans there and the NBA moved its all-star game from Charlotte. An AP analysis in 2017 found the reaction would eventually cost North Carolina at least $3.76 billion in lost business.

Then, Georgia’s corporate lobbying groups — with Delta’s and Coca-Cola’s backing — took no such chances, speaking out forcefully against Georgia conservatives' version of a “religious freedom” bill. Lawmakers passed it anyway but Kemp’s predecessor, Republican Nathan Deal, vetoed it amid the chamber outcry.

Today, Delta and Coca-Cola's response to the Georgia voting fight is standing as a cautionary tale for other businesses.

Ed Bastian, the airline’s chief executive, initially released a statement noting the business lobby’s role in altering the bill as it moved through the General Assembly. Officials at the Atlanta Metro Chamber, where Bastian currently serves as president, detailed how corporate lobbyists spent weeks at the Capitol on mitigating provisions.

Some Georgia Republicans wanted to roll back the state’s no-excuse absentee voting law, end automatic voter registration and ban Sunday early voting used heavily by Black churches. They also wanted to require photocopies of state IDs to receive and submit absentee ballots, while banning “drop boxes” as ballot collection receptacles.

The final law preserved no-excuse absentee voting and automatic registration. The new ID requirement for absentee ballots allows a voter to write their state ID number, rather than produce a photocopy, and the legislature included funding for free state IDs. The law also codifies in-person early voting on weekends, although it allows counties to choose whether to be open for voting for up to two Sundays. And it made drop boxes of mail ballots a permanent fixture in Georgia, but limited the number.

Business leaders’ philosophy, according to Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan, was “basically, Republicans are going to pass something, so they might as well try to keep from being awful.”

But by Wednesday, the same day 72 Black business executives published a letter in The New York Times urging corporate leaders to speak out, Bastian was more direct. He sent a companywide memo declaring the law “unacceptable” and “based on a lie” — though he didn’t mention Trump.

Big business’s mistake, Jordan said, was “thinking there was ever any version that wouldn’t end up like this.”

The Right’s New Higher-Ed Target: Community Colleges,"Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty/handout

Higher ed is under attack, everywhere. We have grown to expect attacks on elite institutions, but now threats target regional and rural institutions, metastasizing. Conservatives are assaulting the very institutions that provide the surest access to higher education for their own constituents. A current case in point is what is happening at Northern Idaho College (NIC), a small, rural community college in Coeur D’Alene.

Early on a very cold Friday morning this past January, NIC Board Chair Todd Banducci sent five rapid-fire emails to the institution’s president, Nick MacLennan, giving the president “his marching orders.” Banducci was not happy. He demanded the president stifle student speech and change the college’s COVID-19 protocols. For good measure, he derided the president’s wife as a Hillary supporter. He directly threatened the president’s job.

Board chairs and presidents can often be at odds. But tension at NIC seems less about educational operations, outcomes, or fiscal responsibility. Instead, it seems to be pulling from the Trump political playbook. Schools like NIC that provide the bulk of the educational opportunities in this country get little attention and fewer resources. They train students for careers, focusing mainly on vocational outcomes, because jobs matter. In short, they are an unusual target for conservatives.

The World’s Changing Fast. Here’s How Higher Ed Can Keep Up.

This dust-up in Idaho is significant because what’s happening there highlights what is happening everywhere. The cause seems to be the drastic shift in local politics, as The Chronicle of Higher Education put it: “In Kootenai County [the county that NIC serves], as in counties across America, disdain for colleges is thriving among people on the right and far right. For years, locals have made bogeymen out of the faculty, characterizing them as radicals with leftist agendas, committed to indoctrinating students.”

What we are seeing is much more than institutional distrust. As a recent letter writer to a Midwestern local newspaper said, “We have far too many progressive liberals in non-political positions of power [at universities] that affect our daily lives,” and that has to stop. Conservatives since the 1950s have seen elite colleges and universities as systems of indoctrination and ideology. In 1966, after all, Ronald Reagan ran for governor of California on a platform that centered on attacking the University of California at Berkeley as nothing more than a home for radicalisms.

Story continues

Starting in the 1980s, there was a push for colleges to become more vocationally focused, i.e. less elitist, which turned fire on the liberal arts as useless. This sentiment is expressed in the 2005 Commission on the Future of Higher Education, better known as the Spellings Commission. Formed by President George W. Bush to investigate the state of higher education, its report stressed a needed shift toward job training and readiness. What makes the current attacks so shocking is the hostile gaze is now aimed at what was seen by an earlier generation of conservatives and neoliberals (Clinton, Obama, and Biden?) as the solution.

Critics have continued to attack ethnic and gender studies, as well as the arts and humanities. “If you want to take gender studies that's fine,” said North Carolina GOP Governor Pat McCrory in 2013, “go to a private school and take it... But I don't want to subsidize that...” They blame critical race theory for ruining America and teaching students to hate their country. Now, vocationally focused institutions are rolled up into the assault. In the era of “alternative facts,” the devaluing of education should worry everyone as the damage done to our institutions of science and learning is dangerous, as COVID-19 revealed.

Unfolding right before our eyes is the next phase of the systematic dismantling of higher education. Higher education isn’t perfect and everyone agrees it needs true change. It will no doubt try to respond to these new pressures, but all the paths seem blocked.

Maybe Joe Biden can try to restore confidence in higher education. His wife is, after all, a professor at a community college. He brought rollbacks of Trump/DeVos-era policies. Recently, we learned that the Biden administration plans to give the nation’s community colleges a huge shot in the arm (funding).

If he is successful, Biden seems poised to return to the past that sees higher education mainly as job training. And, while the infusions of money for these institutions is surely needed, it might come too late for schools like NIC, who are in a deathmatch for their lives. Higher education is hurting. Lost in the moment is the larger purpose of higher education, that universities can and should have twin goals: provide students with the skills and means for a good life and to be engaged in the world. One without the other is failure.

Demographics seem to be destiny. Much attention has been paid to national demographic trends. But, change is happening everywhere. In Idaho’s Kootenia county, BuzzFeed reported on the “thousands of ex–LAPD officers, doomsday preppers, ‘traditionalist’ Catholics, and far-right evangelicals who’ve flocked to the white, conservative utopia of North Idaho over the last 20 years, working to remake the Republican Party in their own image.” It appears they succeeded.

In 2020, more than half of state Idaho Republican senators wrote a letter to Boise State University President Marlene Tromp, who was only on the job a few days, attacking the university’s diversity efforts, stating that “this drive to create a diversified and inclusive culture becomes divisive and exclusionary because it separates and segregates students….” The Idaho legislature then slashed the higher education budget. “I think the problem is curriculum, and the bureaucracy that is moving that curriculum,” said GOP state representative Vito Barberi. “We’re talking about equity and inclusion instead of reading, writing, and arithmetic.” “Why is it that university towns, every time they’re polled, show a socialist bent?” He continues, “It has to come from those that are teaching the curriculum. So the whole bureaucracy itself in my mind has already turned left.”

Many conservatives see tenure as how the liberal establishment holds power. In Iowa, every year since 2017, the Republicans in the legislature have introduced bills to dissolve tenure in the state's public institutions. “I wonder if the assault on free speech by some university professors is not related to the belief that they’re Teflon-coated and indestructible,” said GOP Iowa Rep. Steve Holt, “therefore, maybe we need to look at getting rid of tenure...” There have been other states that have also moved in this direction, such as Wisconsin, Missouri, and Florida just to name just a few.

So it is through this larger framework that we need to see NIC’s issues. The Board Chair recently said he was battling the “NIC ‘deep state’” on an “almost daily basis.” Liberals, he continued, “are quite deeply entrenched” but “we are registering victories,” Referring to faculty and administrators as part of the deep state, viewing higher education as a liberal hoax. Sound familiar?

Seeing colleges and universities as factories for making Democrats and therefore enemies of the state results in the diminishment of the very institutions that can and should provide a pathway into the middle class and fulfillment of the American dream. It, therefore, seems counterintuitive that conservatives would attack the very institutions they should be holding most dear and defending.

Vulnerable Dems fret after getting a shock: AOC’s campaign cash,"As the midterm campaign’s first fundraising deadline approached this week, several vulnerable House Democrats got an unwelcome surprise in their accounts: $5,000 from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The New York Democrat sent the contributions to her colleagues to help keep the House majority ahead of a tough cycle without directly contributing to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, with which she’s publicly clashed. But Ocasio-Cortez's largesse — and an oversight at the campaign headquarters — has instead raised awkward questions among her colleagues as some swing-district Democrats fret over whether to return her money before the GOP can turn it into an attack ad.

Some members whose campaigns got unexpected Ocasio-Cortez cash are seeking answers directly from DCCC Chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) and his top staffers. DCCC aides gave lawmakers’ wire transfer information to Ocasio-Cortez's aides without the approval of more senior officials, according to multiple people familiar with the contributions.

Even if imperiled House Democrats refund her contribution now, Ocasio-Cortez’s name is almost certain to show up on their Federal Election Commission reports when they’re due this month — creating a liability for members of her party who have to win reelection in districts where her political brand is poisoned thanks to years of unrelenting Republican attacks.

While some are grateful for the infusion of cash, at least three Democrats have so far either declined the initial transfer or said they would return the money: Reps. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Carolyn Bourdeaux of Georgia and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, according to multiple sources.

Several people involved with the episode described it as an unforced error by the DCCC, with the staff of its campaign arm failing to anticipate the political ramifications of putting their party’s most polarizing figure on their donor rolls of vulnerable members known as frontliners.

Story continues

Chris Hayden, a spokesman for DCCC declined to comment on the details but said: “We appreciate Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's ongoing commitment to a Democratic majority. Due to a miscommunication, some transfers were made in error, but that has been addressed.”

Normally, swing-district Democrats are scrounging for every last dollar to help them secure their reelections, particularly in a first quarter that has been tougher than usual for candidates across the board. But the Ocasio-Cortez donation, these Democrats said, was unsolicited and came without warning. Many of their campaigns did not receive a heads-up from the DCCC about the donation until after it hit members’ accounts — a move that surprised senior aides and campaign consultants.

“The GOP has spent four years saying the frontliners are all socialists. Now they’ve got the receipts to prove it. Anyone telling themselves this won’t be in campaign ads is in denial,” said one Democratic consultant who works for swing-seat members.

In the political donation world, wire transfers are commonly used to quickly move large sums of money from one account to another, particularly in the final stretch of a fundraising quarter and during a pandemic. The Ocasio-Cortez transfers carried clear political risk for some members, however, and some sources pointed out that she could have alleviated the current anxiety by giving to the DCCC directly.

Still, other Democrats said they saw Ocasio-Cortez’s interest in helping endangered incumbents as a positive sign for party unity, even if they were stunned by the method. And privately, the liberal star already is personally close with some of the frontliners, many of whom were elected in the same blue wave that helped Democrats recapture the House in 2018.

She offered to make similar donations to frontline Democrats during the 2020 election cycle but only contributed to those who took her up on the offer, according to two sources familiar with her political operation.

The sophomore New York Democrat spent years at loggerheads with the campaign arm and is among several progressives who have refused to pay member dues to DCCC, in part because of its treatment of liberal primary challengers.

Her current round of donations alone — an intended total of $160,000 — amount to more than half of Ocasio-Cortez’s entire dues goal for the 2020 cycle, according to a dues report obtained by POLITICO.

Ocasio-Cortez is a prolific fundraiser with a campaign machine of her own that could be a major asset to Democrats as they attempt to hold onto their majority next fall. While she has given to some individual frontline Democrats in the past, such as Reps. Mike Levin and Katie Porter of California as well as Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, her past giving has been more selective.

This year’s crop of DCCC frontliners include 32 hand-picked Democrats who face some of the toughest elections in the country next November. The majority of them flipped GOP seats in 2018. Some, like Levin and Porter of California, proudly identify with the left wing of the party, and would face minimal political risk from an affiliation from the progressive icon.

But Ocasio-Cortez's money poses a problem for Democrats such as Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Slotkin, who represent more moderate turf and have sought to distance themselves from the left wing of the caucus. Many of the Democratic frontliners are particularly anxious this cycle after their party’s down-ballot disaster last November, which wiped out 13 incumbents. Even Democrats who clung onto their seats saw victory margins much closer than expected and remain shocked by inaccurate polling.

Now Republican campaigns have obvious fodder for attacks on many of those Democrats as “funded by” or “taking money from” Ocasio-Cortez. Past GOP attempts to elevate Ocasio-Cortez and other younger Democrats of color into bogeywomen haven't paid huge dividends with independent voters, but their effectiveness in motivating the Republican base means they're likely to continue — particularly as President Joe Biden looks to incorporate some of her priorities into his agenda.

Still, several Democratic operatives said they are expecting GOP candidates to run attacks yoking their members to Ocasio-Cortez and democratic socialist policies whether or not her contributions get returned.

“If the Republicans are going to hit us on AOC, they’re going to do it anyways,” said one Democratic source close to the process. “They don't care about the truth.”

MLB All-Star Game yanked from Georgia over voting law,"NEW YORK (AP) — Atlanta lost Major League Baseball’s summer All-Star Game on Friday over the league’s objections to sweeping changes to Georgia voting laws that critics — including the CEOs of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola — have condemned as being too restrictive.

The decision to pull the July 13 game from Atlanta’s Truist Park amounts to the first economic backlash against Georgia for the voting law that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp quickly signed into law March 25.

Kemp has insisted the law’s critics have mischaracterized what it does, yet GOP lawmakers adopted the changes largely in response to false claims of fraud in the 2020 elections by former President Donald Trump and his supporters. The law includes new restrictions on voting by mail and greater legislative control over how elections are run.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred made the decision to move the All-Star events and the amateur draft from Atlanta after discussions with individual players and the Players Alliance, an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year, the commissioner said in a statement. A new ballpark for the events wasn’t immediately revealed.

Manfred said he also spoke with the Major League Baseball Players Association, which at the time of the commissioner's decision said it had still not taken a stance.

“I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB draft,” Manfred said. “Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.”

The White House said President Joe Biden supports the decision.

“The President has made his concerns about the bill passed in Georgia clear, given its extreme provisions that impact the ability of so many citizens to cast their votes,"" the White House said. ""He said earlier this week that if the decision was made by Major League Baseball to move the All-Star game, he would certainly support that decision – and now that MLB has made that choice, he certainly does.”

Story continues

In a statement, Trump blasted the move and urged his supporters to “boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections.”

Kemp called MLB's action a “knee-jerk decision” that means “cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included. If the left doesn’t agree with you, facts and the truth do not matter.”

“This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from (President) Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams about a bill that expands access to the ballot box and ensures the integrity of our elections,"" Kemp said in a statement, referring to the Democratic candidate whom he narrowly defeated in the 2018 election. ""I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied.”

Georgia state House Speaker David Ralston, a powerful Republican, vowed to stand behind the new law, which adds strict identification requirements for voting absentee by mail, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to hand out food or water to voters waiting in line, among many other provisions.

Georgia Republicans say changes were needed to maintain voter confidence in the election system. Democrats and voting rights groups say the law will disproportionately affect communities of color. On Wednesday, two of Georgia's most prominent business leaders sided with the law's opponents.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian labeled the law “unacceptable,” while Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey called the legislation a “step backward.”

The Atlanta Braves issued a statement Friday saying the team is disappointed by Manfred's decision.

“We are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,” the team said. “The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion.""

Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who is to guide the National League All-Star team, applauded MLB for moving the game from Georgia.

“I think in a world now where people want and need to be heard — and in this particular case, people of color — for Major League Baseball to listen and do something about it, to be proactive, it sets a tone,” said Roberts, the son of a Black father and Japanese mother.

Abrams, who has championed voting rights since her loss to Kemp, blasted the new voting law. The Democrat is being closely watched to see if she seeks a rematch against Kemp in 2022.

“Georgia Republicans must renounce the terrible damage they have caused to our voting system and the harm they have inflicted on our economy,” Abrams said.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, said she supports MLB's decision. Atlanta will no doubt share in the economic loss, though the Braves' home stadium is now located outside the city, in suburban Cobb County.

“Unfortunately, the removal of the MLB All-Star Game from Georgia is likely the first of many dominoes to fall until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed,” Bottoms said in a statement.

Some Democrats from the Georgia county where the game was to be held said they oppose MLB's move. Lisa Cupid, the Black chairwoman of the Cobb County Commission, said she urged the league to stay rather than harm hotels and other businesses still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.

State Rep. Teri Anulewicz, a Democrat whose district includes the stadium, added: “I don’t know who Major League Baseball feels they are punishing. The governor, from his statement, has made clear he doesn’t feel he is being punished.”

The relocation of high-profile sports events from cities in response to social issues has a long history in the U.S.

The NFL originally awarded the 1993 Super Bowl to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, but decided in March 1991 to move it to Pasadena, California, after the state failed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day an official holiday. Arizona became the last state to adopt an MLK Holiday when voters approved it in November 1992.

The NBA first scheduled its 2017 All-Star Game at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, then shifted it in July 2016 because of its objections to a North Carolina law that limited anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. The law was partially repealed in 2017, and the 2019 All-Star Game was held in Charlotte.

Manfred said despite the change of venue, MLB still plans to use the All-Star Game this year to honor Hank Aaron, the Braves’ Hall of Famer and former career home run champion who died on Jan. 22 at age 86.

Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker, a former teammate of Aaron's, applauded the move and said the late outfielder ""always had the rights of the people in the forefront of his mind and in his heart.”

“This is what Hank would have liked, even if it was his town,” Baker told reporters.

(This article contains spoilers for the Marvel Disney+ series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” through the third episode) It was interesting to realize that at the end of the third episode “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” it’s still extremely unclear what the overall plot is. That’s not a bad thing — Sam and Bucky have a mystery they’re trying to solve. And that mystery has expanded greatly with the introduction of a new player: The Power Broker. The gist of the main story thread thus far on “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” is that there’s an anarchist-style group called the Flag Smashers who are up to no good — they want to return the world to the way it was after Thanos snapped half the universe out of existence. How they mean to accomplish that is unknown, but it will presumably involve mass murder. The Flag Smashers are also full of folks who have taken the super soldier serum and can beat up just about anyone. And they’ve got somebody else on their tale as well: Somebody they call the Power Broker, whose identity is unknown as of now. Also Read: 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier': Steve Rogers Really Screwed Sharon Over This is an interesting dynamic, particularly with regards to the Power Broker since we have no idea if this person is good or bad. We really just know one thing about them, in fact — that they are the source of the Flag Smasher’s powers. So in the Marvel Comics, the Power Broker is a guy named Curtiss Jackson, and he’s a dude who basically sells superpowers to people. That trait is by far his most relevant to “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.” This week, in the third episode, it was confirmed that the Power Broker is the one responsible for the creation of this new super soldier serum that was derived from Isaiah Bradley’s blood. But who could this be? There’s really no reason to assume that the Power Broker is going to be the same person on “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” that he is in the comics. This is a pretty obscure character, and he’s actually been dead in the comics for a while and hasn’t had a meaningful role to play in any stories in decades. So the Power Broker could be anyone, and not necessarily Curtiss Jackson. Beyond the comics, there aren’t many clues to go on. The name first comes up at the end of episode 2 as the Flag Smashers are loading their latest haul of medical supplies onto a small plane — and one of them gets a call that the Power Broker’s people are there. They scramble to load up as much as they can but are forced to leave some behind as they take off, barely escaping. Also Read: 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier': Who Is Karli Morgenthau? Though one of them doesn’t, with the Power Broker’s men shooting him as he stalled for time. But they didn’t shoot until this superpowered terrorist charged at them. So the Power Broker may not be feeling overtly murderous. In any case, the Power Broker is mad at the Flag Smashers because they stole the serum, and he or she wants it back. So there aren’t a lot of good candidates. Zemo would have been the most obvious candidate, just because he’s an existing villain. But that doesn’t really jive with his whole deal. Back in “Civil War” he wanted to learn about the other Winter Soldiers — others who had been subjected to some version of the serum — just so he could kill them. Zemo doesn’t like super-powered people, and now he’s helping out our heroes specifically because he wants to destroy this new serum. Plus, he’s been locked up since the last time we saw him, so he’s got an alibi. So with him out of the way, there are two main candidates as I see it. The first, and less likely I think, is Batroc the Leaper. He’s the guy who was leading the crew that Sam fought on the airplane in the opening sequence of “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” premiere, and a returning minor character from “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” His whole deal in that aerial mission last week is still unclear, so he’s a prime candidate for the Power Broker. Also Read: 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' Just Introduced a Future Falcon But I think it’s more likely that he just works for the Power Broker. I think the real Power Broker is somebody we know better than we know Batroc, and who only just showed up on “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” this week: Sharon Carter. While there is definitely a bit of a villainous air when people say that title aloud, it’s important to remember that it was the Flag Smashers — clear antagonists after they blew up a building this week — who were afraid of them. The Power Broker is definitely an independent third party, and might not actually be a bad guy — and I certainly don’t think Sharon will be a bad guy. Sharon as the Power Broker makes sense to me in light of, well, everything we’ve learned about what happened with her since we saw her last in “Civil War.” She was branded a traitor like everyone else on #TeamCap, but I guess nobody ever thought to check up on her after the Avengers reunited in “Infinity War.” “Avengers: Endgame” showed us that the Avengers at least believed that Sharon was snapped away — she was one of the faces on the screens at Avengers HQ listing off the missing folks — which would mean she’s accomplished a lot in the months since the Hulk snapped everybody back into existence. So if she can build up some kind of black market art organization, then she’s probably capable of plenty more. That enterprise, and her massive home, and her armed guards are all potential clues — it wouldn’t be shocking for somebody who has “broker” in their name to have an illicit art business. And you absolutely would expect a crime boss to have an extremely nice house with a bunch of guards. If it’s not Sharon, then surely it would have to be a character we know already either from earlier in this series or a previous MCU movie. At this stage it would be strange to introduce somebody completely new, since we’ve only got three episodes of “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” left to go.

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"Amazon says it supports expanding voting rights but it gave $500,000 to lawmakers who oppose those efforts","The New York Times

There’s nothing unusual about exaggeration in politics. But when it comes to the debate over voting rights, something more than exaggeration is going on. There’s a real — and bipartisan — misunderstanding about whether making it easier or harder to vote, especially by mail, has a significant effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. The evidence suggests it does not. The fight over the new Georgia election law is only the latest example. That law, passed last week, has been condemned by Democrats as voter suppression, or even as tantamount to Jim Crow. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Democrats are understandably concerned about a provision that empowers the Republican-controlled state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. That provision has uncertain but potentially substantial effects, depending on what the Legislature might do in the future. And it’s possible the law is intended to do exactly what progressives fear: reshape the electorate to the advantage of Republicans, soon after an electoral defeat, by making it harder to vote. And yet the law’s voting provisions are unlikely to significantly affect turnout or Democratic chances. It could plausibly even increase turnout. In the final account, it will probably be hard to say whether it had any effect on turnout at all. The Georgia law The Georgia can be boiled down to a few points: — The law makes absentee voting harder. People must have a qualifying form of identification to vote by mail. The law also makes it harder to request and return an absentee ballot, restricting the period when people can apply for one and limiting the number of drop boxes where voters can return such a ballot in person. — On balance, it might make in-person voting easier, especially in the general election (though it contains provisions that cut in both directions). The law expands the number of required days of early voting, including on the weekend days that progressives covet (two Saturdays are now required instead of one). There’s also a provision that requires large precincts with long lines to add machines, add staff or split the precinct. Depending on how this is rolled out, it could be a big win for voters in Georgia’s urban areas, who have dealt with some of the longest lines in the country. Cutting in the other direction is the gratuitous and probably ineffectual limitation on handing out food and water to people standing in line to vote. Of more concrete but still limited importance is a rule that makes it harder for people to cast a provisional ballot if they show up at the wrong precinct. (It’s worth noting that many states don’t count these ballots at all, and there were only around 10,000 total provisional ballots in Georgia in the last election, including those cast in the right precinct). — It shortens the runoff period. Runoffs would be held four weeks after an initial election, instead of the nine weeks that had been in place for federal elections in the last few years. A main consequence would be to shorten early runoff voting to one week, instead of three, plausibly affecting turnout in exactly the kind of close, low-turnout race where it could easily be decisive. — It empowers the state Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. It removes the secretary of state as chair of the state board of elections and allows the Legislature to appoint a majority of the board’s members, including the chair. And it empowers the state board to take over county boards of elections, if the circumstances merit it. These might prove to be very important. But for the purposes of this article, we are not considering them “voter suppression” provisions. They do not inherently make it harder for people to vote by restricting whether or how they can vote. If we leave aside the administrative provisions and the question of intent, the core question on voter suppression is to what extent does reducing voting options — like early voting in the runoffs or mail voting in general — reduce turnout and Democratic chances? The limited import of convenience voting For decades, reformers have assumed that the way to increase turnout is to make voting easier. Yet surprisingly, expanding voting options to make it more convenient hasn’t seemed to have a huge effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. That’s the finding of decades of political science research on advance, early and absentee voting. One prominent study even found that early voting decreases turnout, though that’s a bit of an outlier. There’s essentially no evidence that the vast expansion of no-excuse absentee mail voting, in which anyone can apply for a mail absentee ballot, had any discernible effect on turnout in 2020. That shouldn’t be a huge surprise: Even universal vote by mail, in which every registered voter is automatically sent a mail ballot (as opposed to every voter having an opportunity to apply for one), increases turnout by only about 2% with no discernible partisan advantage. Believe it or not, turnout increased just as much in the states that didn’t have no-excuse absentee voting as it did in the states that added it for the first time. Similarly, Joe Biden improved over Hillary Clinton’s performance by 3 percentage points in the states that added it, compared with 2.9 points in the states that did not. A more rigorous study by political scientists at Stanford found that no-excuse mail voting might have increased turnout by a whopping 0.02% in the 2020 election. The study used a novel approach: The researchers compared the turnout among 65-year-olds in Texas, who were eligible to vote by mail without an excuse, with 64-year-olds in Texas, who weren’t. The turnout among 64-year-olds was indistinguishable from that of 65-year-olds, even though the latter group voted by mail in large numbers. Like Georgia, Texas did not require an identification to vote by mail, but has a strict ID requirement for in-person voting. The partisan makeup of the electorate didn’t appear to change, either. The Democratic share of voters appeared to tick up by two-tenths of a percentage point — enough to decide a very close election. But it’s also so small that it could just be statistical noise, with no effect at all. Social science methods just don’t offer the level of precision necessary to nail down whether this, or any, change might move the needle by a tenth of a point. The Georgia law doesn’t come anywhere close to eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, unlike what the political scientists tested in Texas. As a result, one might expect the new law to have an even smaller effect. (You could make a counterintuitive argument that making absentee voting harder is worse for Democrats than eliminating it altogether, and that Democrats might be better off discouraging people from mail voting to avoid unnecessary ballot rejections of people who could have successfully voted in person.) The Georgia runoff elections, while hardly a scientific case study, nonetheless offer another useful example. There were fewer opportunities to vote in advance compared with the general election, because of the shorter election campaign and the holiday season. Based on the drop-off in early voting, many analysts wound up underestimating the final turnout by 20% or more. In the end, turnout exceeded expectations. The number of Election Day voters was higher than it was in the general election, as many people who might have voted early if it weren’t for Christmas or New Year’s Day now turned out on Election Day. Maybe runoff turnout would have been higher with the same early voting opportunities as in the general. But maybe not. And none of this had any discernible negative effect on the Democrats, who of course did better than they did in the general. Why doesn’t convenience matter? How is it possible that something like eliminating no-excuse absentee mail voting, a method beloved by millions of voters, wouldn’t materially affect turnout or election results? One simple answer is that convenience isn’t as important as often assumed. Almost everyone who cares enough to vote will brave the inconveniences of in-person voting to do so, whether that’s because the inconveniences aren’t really so great, or because they care enough to suffer them. This supposes a certain reasonable level of convenience, of course: Six-hour lines would change the calculation for many voters. And indeed, long lines do affect turnout. It also supposes a certain level of interest. Someone might think: There’s no way I’m waiting a half-hour in line to vote for dogcatcher. Similarly, the importance of a convenient voting option probably grows as the significance of a race decreases. The implication, though, is that nearly every person will manage to vote if sufficiently convenient options are available, even if the most preferred option doesn’t exist. That makes the Georgia election law’s effort to curb long lines potentially quite significant. Not only might it mitigate the already limited effect of restricting mail voting, but it might even outweigh it. Also, convenience voting may not be as convenient for lower-turnout voters, who essentially decide overall turnout. Low-turnout voters probably aren’t thinking about how they’ll vote a month ahead of the election, when they’ll need to apply for an absentee ballot. Someone thinking about this is probably a high-turnout voter. Low-turnout voters might not even know until Election Day whom they’ll support. And that makes them less likely to take advantage of advance voting options like no-excuse early voting, which requires them to think about the election early and often: to submit an application, fill out a ballot and return it. As a result, convenience voting methods tend to reinforce the socioeconomic biases favoring high-turnout voters. The methods ensure that every high-interest voter has many opportunities to vote, without doing quite as much to draw less engaged voters to the polls. Another reason is that voting restrictions may backfire by angering and energizing Democratic voters. This law’s restrictions on handing out water in line, for instance, may do more to mobilize Democrats than to stop them from voting. One recent study even theorized that the Supreme Court’s decision to roll back elements of the Voting Rights Act didn’t reduce Black turnout because subsequent efforts to restrict voting were swiftly countered by efforts to mobilize Black voters. That doesn’t mean the Georgia law or other such laws are without consequence. Many make voting more difficult, enough to intimidate or discourage some voters. Many outright disenfranchise voters, even if only in small numbers. Perhaps the disenfranchisement of even a single voter merits outrage and opposition, especially if the law is passed on dubious or even fabricated grounds, and with Jim Crow mass disenfranchisement as a historical backdrop. But setting aside intent, it does mean that many such voting provisions, like that in Georgia, are unlikely to have a huge effect on turnout or Democratic chances. There are consequences to misunderstanding the stakes of changing voting laws. Minor changes in voting access can overshadow larger issues, including the kinds of potentially significant provisions in the Georgia law that empower the state Legislature. The HR 1 bill passed in the U.S. House by Democrats on a near party-line vote, for instance, would do quite a bit to expand voting access but relatively little to protect against partisan interference in election administration. The perception that voting laws have existential stakes for democracy or the political viability of the two parties has made bipartisan compromise extremely difficult. The virtue of bipartisanship is often and understandably dismissed as naive, but voting laws are a rare case where bipartisanship has value of its own. Democracy, after all, depends on the consent of the loser. This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
EXPLAINER: What Biden's new $100B plan for broadband means,"The Conversation

Holocaust survivor Shalom Stamberg holds a book with a photo of himself in Auschwitz, alongside a copy of his concentration camp record. AP Photo/Ariel SchalitOne in four American millennials believe the Holocaust was exaggerated or entirely made up, according to a recent national survey that sought to find out what young adults know about the genocide of nearly 6 million Jews at the hands of Nazis some 80 years ago. That startling statistic was cited as one of the main reasons that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided in October to finally ban Holocaust denial across the social network. Denying the Holocaust ever happened is an enduring form of anti-Semitic propaganda that attempts to deny or minimize the atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jews during World War II. Following Facebook’s lead, Twitter announced it, too, would remove any posts that denied the history of the Holocaust, though CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to contradict that policy at a Senate hearing weeks later. Holocaust deniers have continued to emerge in social media, and perhaps predictably, many have migrated to less restrictive sites like Parler, where hashtags like #HolocaustNeverHappened and #HolocaustIsALie are widespread. “If you want Holocaust denial, hey, Parler is going to be great for you,” Bill Gates recently said of the social network. While some tech companies address the rise in Holocaust revisionism, and others leave the door open, social networks have played an unwitting role in helping to distort the memory of these horrific events. But as a scholar who studies online extremism, I believe that same community could do more to protect Holocaust remembrance by highlighting the digitized accounts of those who lived through it. French Holocaust survivor Victor Perahia, interned as a child in the Drancy camp outside Paris and then deported to Bergen-Belsen, speaks to students during a January 2020 workshop dedicated to Holocaust remembrance at Drancy. AP Photo/Christophe Ena A decadeslong campaign Holocaust denial has been a tool of anti-Semitic movements since the 1960s. Pseudo-academic groups like the Institute for Historical Review, for example, spent years working to distort the public’s aging memory of the Holocaust, which took place between 1933 and 1945. They tried to cast doubt on the feasibility of the mass executions, and even the existence of the gas chambers. They held annual conferences and gathered fellow deniers to share their beliefs that these events were conjured up by the Jewish people mostly as a means to justify the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. A photo taken April 12, 1945, shows just some of the bodies found by U.S. troops when they arrived at Nordhausen concentration camp in Germany. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library For decades, most people quickly discarded those claims, because they had heard the firsthand accounts of the survivors who were sent to the camps and witnessed the daily operation of genocide and murder of family members. The allegations of the deniers could also not withstand the accounts of soldiers who liberated the camps and made the terrible discoveries of body-filled crematoriums and mass graves. But for deniers, Holocaust revision has little to do with history. Denialism is really a pretext for delivering anti-Semitism in the form of “scholarship,” although few academics ever gave it such attention. So hate groups had to find other means of circulation. They found it online. An image from a film taken during the Soviet liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in early 1945 shows children who had survived the Holocaust. Belarusian State Archive of Documentary Film and Photography/United States Holocaust Memorial Museum via Wikimedia Commons A conspiracy resurrected When the internet took off in the late 1990s, Holocaust deniers and countless other conspiracy theorists saw an opportunity to spread their ideas to new audiences. Anti-Semitic groups could now publish their distortions in well-visited forums, and later in faux-informational websites like Metapedia and The Occidental Observer – extremist communities, in fact, that collectively receive some 350,000 visitors each month. The internet also gave Holocaust deniers an opportunity to reach a much wider public through social media. As early as 2009, Facebook groups emerged that were dedicated to “debunking” the Holocaust, as #Holohoax became a popular hashtag on Twitter, which it continues to be today. Reddit also became a far-right haven for Holocaust deniers, one of whom gained national attention when he was the invited guest of a Florida congressman to the 2018 State of the Union address. For deniers, the internet helped repackage their conspiracy into something less recognizable than hate. I’ve long studied this process, which I call information laundering, tracking illegitimate forms of information, like Holocaust denial, that flow through social networks, blogs and search engines. There they intermix with mainstream ideas and slowly become washed of their radical origins. This decadeslong campaign has resulted in the current surveys that show nearly a quarter of young adults are misinformed or skeptical about the Holocaust. Only now, few survivors are left to correct the record. That makes it even more important to spread the truth. Perhaps the internet can help. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower views the charred bodies of prisoners after the 1945 liberation of the Nazis’ Ohrdruf concentration camp. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library Eisenhower’s intuition When Gen. Dwight Eisenhower visited the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945, after its liberation by U.S. forces, he realized how impossible it might be for people to believe the scale of Nazi atrocities. He wrote powerfully of the experience, and of his reasons for going to see it in person: “The things I saw beggar description. … In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. … I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the near future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to ‘propaganda.’” Eisenhower’s words are instructions for future generations. They underscore the need to be a witness to human cruelty in order to protect the memory of, and lessons learned from, these events from those who would try to distort them. Back online, it may not be enough for social networks to ban Holocaust denial. Similar bans in Europe haven’t limited the rise of anti-Semitism there. Instead, social networks could follow Eisenhower’s example by answering the falsehoods of Holocaust deniers with the true stories of survivors. The internet is already home to thousands of digitized survivor testimonies. They include oral histories that could be readily activated by social networks to refute those who deny the existence of the gas chambers with the accounts of those who stood inside them or witnessed them at work. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit might share the firsthand stories of the Nazi persecutions, separations at the camps or rare reunions, wherever false claims arise, to counter denials with facts. Holocaust survivor Cecilie Klein-Pollack, the author’s grandmother. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum In the spirit of that counternarrative, I will place my grandmother’s story here. She was a Holocaust survivor. She later wrote about her experiences in Auschwitz, where, upon arrival, she and her sister were separated from their mother and her sister’s son, never to see them again. There are millions of other experiences like hers, and survivors of other genocides whose stories must be retold as well, from Armenia to Rwanda. [Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.] Holocaust deniers have long waited for the time when there were no remaining survivors or witnesses to keep these histories alive. But the internet is a powerful archive. Social networks have an opportunity to combat hateful disinformation by posting the personal stories of these tragedies, and end the so-called “debate” about whether the Holocaust ever happened. As Eisenhower well understood, history needs protecting.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Amazon acknowledges issue of drivers urinating in bottles in apology to Rep. Pocan,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has apologized to U.S. Representative Mark Pocan, admitting to scoring an ""own goal"" in its initial denial of his suggestion that its drivers were sometimes forced to urinate in bottles during their delivery rounds.

""We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed,"" the company said in a blog post https://bit.ly/2PnoLKr.

Its admission came a week after the Democrat criticised Amazon's working conditions, saying in a tweet: ""Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles.""

Amazon initially issued a denial, saying in a tweet: ""You don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us."" But it subsequently walked back those comments.

""This was an own goal, we're unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan,"" Amazon said in its blog post, adding that its previous response only referred to staff at its warehouses or fulfillment centers.

The company said the issue was industry-wide and it would look for solutions, without specifying what these might be.

Amazon's apology comes at a time when workers at an Alabama warehouse are waiting for a vote count that could result in the online retailer's first unionized facility in the United States and mark a watershed moment for organized labor.

Amazon has long discouraged attempts among its more than 800,000 U.S. employees to organize. Allegations by many workers of a grueling or unsafe workplace have turned unionizing the company into a key goal for the U.S. labor movement.

Who's the 'next Gonzaga?' There may never be another one,"Mike Roth’s phone buzzes every spring.

Administrators from small-conference schools often call Gonzaga’s longtime athletic director to pepper him with questions or arrange a meeting in person. They all want to understand how a tiny Jesuit school from Eastern Washington built a basketball program that rocketed to national prominence two decades ago and sustained that success ever since.

“It’s been going on since the early part of our run,” Roth told Yahoo Sports. “Every year, athletic directors and university presidents fly to Spokane and meet with me to try to get a better sense of the secret sauce. What is it that they can do to replicate what we’re doing?”

The parade of imitators that Gonzaga has spawned seldom come close to the standard that the Zags have set. There’s ample evidence that becoming “the next Gonzaga” is an unattainable goal typically spouted by people who don’t seem to grasp what it would take to mimic what the Zags have accomplished.

In April 2013, after hiring Reggie Theus as his new basketball coach, Cal State Northridge athletic director Brandon Martin audaciously told reporters, “We want to be the next Gonzaga.” Theus went 53-105 in five scandal-tainted seasons before he and Martin were fired.

Early in his tenure at Grand Canyon, Dan Majerle boldly set a goal of building the Gonzaga of the Southwest. Grand Canyon fired Majerle at the outset of the pandemic last year after seven seasons without a league title or an NCAA tournament bid.

The athletic director at UT-Arlington reportedly fired his coach after three consecutive 20-win seasons because he wanted someone who could turn the Mavericks into the “next Gonzaga.” Chris Ogden went 44-47 during his three-year tenure before leaving this week to become an assistant coach at Texas.

Those stories are a reminder of what Roth warns other schools who come to Spokane in search of the Gonzaga blueprint. Never before has a one-time small-conference afterthought reached 22 consecutive NCAA tournaments or six straight Sweet 16s, let alone entered a Final Four two wins away from becoming college basketball’s first unbeaten national champion in 45 years.

Story continues

“If it was easy,” says Roth, “then everyone would do it.”

Gonzaga's humble origins

Before Gonzaga began its evolution from charming underdog story to perennial powerhouse, the idea that the Zags could contend for a national title was beyond unfathomable. This was a seldom-relevant West Coast Conference program saddled with a remote location, frigid weather, antiquated facilities and a name that was tough to pronounce.

There was no weight room or strength coach. Gonzaga basketball players used the same aging equipment their fellow students did.

There were no charter flights to road games. The Zags perfected the art of looking menacing or unapproachable so strangers wouldn't sit next to them on commercial flights.

There was no endless supply of fresh Nike gear. Players would sign out sweats and warmup jackets at the beginning of the school year and turn them back in nine months later.

“We used to have to show that our shoes had a hole in them before we could get more,” former Gonzaga forward Casey Calvary once told Yahoo Sports.

For years, longtime Gonzaga coach Dan Fitzgerald instructed his staff not to waste precious time or money pursuing recruits with Pac-10 scholarship offers. Fitzgerald insisted that players wouldn’t turn down the likes of Oregon or Washington to play for a lesser-known school that didn’t reach the NCAA tournament for the first time until 1995.

That policy only changed because of pushback from three brash, young assistants Fitzgerald hired during his tenure. Dan Monson, Bill Grier and especially Mark Few argued that the best way to elevate Gonzaga was by chasing only players that Pac-10 teams also were recruiting.

“After Fitz said that, Mark would not recruit anyone else,” Monson told Yahoo Sports. “That’s all he recruited was guys the Pac-10 was recruiting.”

Some of Few’s first believers came to Gonzaga around the same time as the school’s athletic department underwent a change in leadership. In 1997, Monson succeeded Fitzgerald as head basketball coach and Roth replaced him as athletic director.

What followed was a change in mindset, spurred in part by the financial crisis that had engulfed the university at the time. A trend of shrinking enrollment forced Gonzaga to eliminate positions and lay off employees in order to reduce a budget deficit of over $1 million. There were even a few university officials and faculty members who questioned if remaining a Division I athletics program was worth the expense.

“Our controller of the university at the time asked on a regular basis, ‘Why should we spend this money on athletics? What are we really getting out of this?’” Roth said. “I would tell him, the difference between being successful in Division I and Division III is mind boggling. Most people don’t know who the powerhouses in Division III are, but they can tell you the best Division I football and basketball teams in the country.”

Amidst that mess, Roth’s solution was to spend more money on men’s basketball, the sport with the best chance to provide newfound revenue and visibility. Roth gave the program a facelift by updating Gonzaga’s antiquated logo and color scheme. He also endorsed paying a regional sports network to televise Gonzaga basketball games, allowing his coaches to tell parents of recruits that they could see their sons play.

The coaches did their part too. Monson and his staff sought more non-league games against marquee opponents and continued to target higher-level recruits. Few once even used his own money to rent a Cadillac to drive to the home of a recruit.

“He wanted the recruit to think that we had money and we were a big-time program,” Monson said. “We were faking it until we made it. We felt like we had to act big-time if we were ever going to get to be big-time.”

The run that launched Gonzaga

The NCAA tournament run that first propelled Gonzaga into the national spotlight came at the end of Monson’s second season as head coach.

Fueled by the backcourt of Richie Frahm, Matt Santangelo and Quentin Hall, the 10th-seeded Zags strung together upsets of Minnesota and Stanford before a climactic 72-71 Sweet 16 victory over Florida. Calvary’s go-ahead tip-in with 4.5 seconds left in that game prompted then-CBS play-by-play man Gus Johnson to enthusiastically declare, “The slipper still fits!”

The next day, Roth received a phone call from the Gonzaga controller who had questioned if the school should abandon Division I athletics. With Gonzaga basking in the afterglow of its iconic March moment, the controller told Roth, “Mike, I get it now. I get it.”

A handful of programs with coaching vacancies reached out to Monson after the Elite Eight run, but initially none tempted him. Only after Minnesota kept offering more and more money did Monson decide to leave a job where he was comfortable for an opportunity to set himself and his family up for life.

“One hundred people out of 100 would have made that decision,” Few previously told Yahoo Sports. “He went from where he was making $100,000 to $800,000. He also went from having to win the league tournament here to knowing he could finish fifth, sixth, seventh and make the NCAA tournament there.'”

As Monson went to Minneapolis, Few took control at Gonzaga with a goal of not allowing the Zags to go down in history as a “one-hit wonder.” Underseeded Gonzaga teams made back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances in 2000 and 2001, cementing the Zags as a national brand and generating more widespread publicity for the university than the most lavish ad campaign ever could.

Gonzaga’s basketball success led to rapid growth in applications, enrollment and donations. More than 3,000 students applied to be part of Gonzaga’s 2001-02 class, nearly double the 1997-98 number. The university was able to start with a 77 percent larger freshman class while only becoming more selective with its undergraduate admission standards.

“All of a sudden, we were getting students from every state in the country applying to come to Gonzaga,” Roth said. “All of a sudden, we had the largest freshman class in the history of the school, followed by the largest freshman class in the history of the school. Finally, everybody understood, ‘Wow, this is what athletics can do for a university.'”

What followed was a newfound commitment from Gonzaga administrators to further grow the basketball program. They pumped money into it at an unprecedented rate for a program in the low-budget West Coast Conference.

Gonzaga opened a $25 million arena in 2004 to replace its outdated high school-sized gymnasium. Three years later, the Zags began chartering direct flights for road games and recruiting trips. And in 2018, the university unveiled a state-of-the-art practice facility featuring a basketball-only strength-and-conditioning area and sections devoted to nutrition, academic support services and a hall of fame.

Those investments, coupled with salary increases and creative perks, helped Gonzaga fend off overtures from power-conference schools who wanted to hire Few away. Eventually, Few became convinced he could compete for Final Fours and national championships at Gonzaga while also enjoying the scenic views and balanced lifestyle he could not get elsewhere.

“We’ve always been proactive with Mark,” Roth said. “We’ve never waited for somebody to call. If you’re dating your gal and you want to show how much you care, you don’t wait until someone else starts to show interest in her.”

Continuity and culture

The continuity that Gonzaga has enjoyed over the entirety of its run is the most difficult factor for another program to duplicate.

How many schools have the same athletic director for 24 years? Or the same basketball coach for 22 years? Or a pair of assistant coaches, Tommy Lloyd and Brian Michaelson, who have been at Gonzaga in some capacity for nearly as long?

Also unique to Gonzaga is a culture unlike any other. Few famously doesn’t hold staff meetings, nor does he pressure assistant coaches to grind through the night in the office scouring game film and preparing scouting reports. In fact, it’s common for Few to schedule practices around a fly fishing trip or one of his kids’ basketball games.

And yet don’t mistake the relaxed atmosphere at Gonzaga for a lack of ambition or competitive spirit. There is a mentality from the top down of never being satisfied with past achievements and of always striving to keep getting better.

“We’ve always believed there are no limitations to what we can do here at Gonzaga,” Roth said. “In my view, college athletics is no different than business. You’re either getting better or you’re getting worse. When people say, I’ve got this thing figured out. I don’t have to work at getting better anymore, turn around. That’s the direction you’re going.”

That growth mindset is most evident in the evolution of how Few and his staff recruit. While Gonzaga’s ascent began with under-the-radar recruits from the Pacific Northwest, Few recognized the need for other talent pipelines.

Lloyd’s overseas connections made Gonzaga a destination for international prospects like Ronny Turiaf and Przemek Karnowski. The program’s player development track record made it a magnet for elite transfers in need of a second chance like Kyle Wiltjer and Nigel Williams-Goss. And since Gonzaga reached the Final Four for the first time in 2017, it went from occasionally landing a top-50 prospect like Austin Daye or Matt Bouldin, to becoming a serious player for McDonald’s All-Americans and future one-and-dones.

“It has just been unbelievable how Mark has elevated the program year after year,” Monson said. “They don’t just get good players. They get good players who are also good students and good guys. That’s the most amazing thing. They haven’t compromised any part of their culture, who they are or what they stand far.”

This year’s Gonzaga team boasts three of the 15 best players in college basketball: Heralded guard Jalen Suggs, versatile wing Corey Kispert and skilled center Drew Timme. The Zags have won their first four NCAA tournament games by an average of 24 points apiece. Of their 30 wins this season, all but one has come by double figures.

While Gonzaga is favored to celebrate its first national championship on Monday night, the Zags should have more chances for years to come should they fall short. Next year’s recruiting class already includes one top-10 prospect, point guard Hunter Sallis. And Gonzaga is a leading contender to land the No. 1 overall prospect in the 2021 class, 7-footer Chet Holmgren.

The higher Gonzaga ascends, the more unrealistic the idea of a “next Gonzaga” becomes.

“There are plenty of schools around the country that are trying to do what we do, but no one else has been able to do it all these years,” Roth said. “It’s not easy. It’s hard to be as consistent as we’ve been.”

Former president calls on fans to ‘boycott baseball’Obama lauds MLB ‘for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights’ Mike Pence laughs as Donald Trump holds a baseball bat at the White House in 2017. Photograph: Carlos Barría/Reuters Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson led rightwing backlash after Major League Baseball said it would not play its All-Star game in Georgia because of a new law that restricts voting rights in the state. The former president and the Fox News host some say is his Republican political heir thereby ranged themselves against current president Joe Biden and the Democrat he served as vice-president, Barack Obama. “Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans,” Trump said in a statement, “and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the radical left Democrats. “… Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with free and fair elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta and all?” Coke and Delta are among companies which have expressed concern over the Georgia law, which restricts early and mail-in voting, measures seen to target minority voters likely to back Democrats. Laws under consideration in other Republican-run states have attracted criticism from corporate America. The Georgia law was passed by Republicans after Biden won the state against Trump and Democrats won both Senate runoff elections in January. Referring to the segregation of the post-civil war south, Biden called the law: “Jim Crow in the 21st century.” In his own statement on Saturday, Obama congratulated MLB “for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens”. He also said: “There’s no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example.” Aaron, known as the Hammer, was a long-time MLB home-run record holder who played for the Atlanta Braves and endured racist abuse throughout his life in the sport. He died in January, aged 86. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said he had “decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB draft” from the home of the Atlanta Braves. “Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.” The move was not without precedent. In 2016 North Carolina lost the right to host high-profile NCAA college events over a bill which restricted rights for transgender people. On Friday night Carlson, who some say could be a contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 if Trump does not run again, claimed MLB “believes it has veto power over the democratic process”. Before MLB acted, Biden said he would support moving events from Atlanta. Carlson said that showed the president was “willing to destroy even something as wholesome as the country’s traditional game purely to increase the power of his political party”. The chief of the MLB players union has indicated support for the move. In a statement on Friday, the New York Yankees great and Miami Marlins chief executive Derek Jeter said: “We should promote increasing voter turnout as opposed to any measures that adversely impact the ability to cast a ballot … We support the commissioner’s decision to stand up for the values of our game.” The MLB All-Star Game was due to be held at Truist Park, home of the Atlanta Braves. Photograph: John Amis/AP Georgia governor Brian Kemp – a bête noire for Trump over his refusal to overturn Biden’s win – said MLB had “caved to fear, political opportunism and liberal lies”. He also decried “cancel culture”, a key Republican talking point. Stacey Abrams, who Kemp beat in a 2018 election he ran as Georgia secretary of state, said she was “disappointed” the All-Star game would not be played in the state. But Abrams, who campaigns for voting rights and has become an influential figure in the national Democratic party, also said she was “proud of [MLB’s] stance on voting rights” and “urged events and productions to come and speak out or stay and fight”. Also on Friday, nearly 200 companies signed a statement expressing concern at moves to restrict voting rights in Republican-run states. Many observers pointed out that the political ramifications of MLB’s decision to move the All-Star Game will be stronger than the economic fallout, given that coronavirus-related restrictions would have placed limits on capacity at the event this year. A leading professor of sports economics warned that MLB could risk losing the support of conservatives in a fanbase which skews right. “After the country’s top professional basketball and football leagues embraced the Black Lives Matter movement last year,” Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College told the New York Times, “they faced organised boycotts from conservatives, though the effort ultimately had little effect. And baseball’s fanbase is older and whiter than basketball’s or football’s.”",
"Tom Brady rookie card sells for $2.25M, setting new record","Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady isn't just the GOAT of the NFL, he's also the GOAT of NFL cards. A Brady rookie card sold for a record $2.25 million during an auction Friday, according to ESPN.

Before you start digging through your old football cards to see if you have a couple million lying around, know this wasn't your average Brady rookie card. The card was autographed by Brady and was part of a limited set. Only 100 of these cards, which is a 2000 Playoff Contenders Championship Rookie Ticket, were made. The card that sold for the $2.25 million was card No. 99 in the set.

Even if you have that particular card, you might not fetch nearly as much on the open market. The record-breaking card received an 8.5 grade and a 9 grade on Brady's autograph, which helped raise the price. Lower grades on either figure may have prevented the card from breaking the previous record, which was also set by a Brady card.

Tom Brady keeps setting card records

Prior to Friday's sale, Brady already held the record for the most expensive football card ever sold. In March, an autographed Brady rookie card sold for $1.32 million. Before that, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes held the record for most expensive football card sold.

Given the rate at which card prices are moving, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Brady top this record before 2021 is over. The all-time record for most expensive sports card ever sold belongs to Mickey Mantle. A 1952 card of Mantle once sold for $5.2 million.

Brady has a way to go before he reaches that figure, but winning another Super Bowl could get him significantly closer to Mantle.

"NCAA March Madness betting: Once again, most of the bets are on Gonzaga","There's no line too high for Gonzaga bettors.

Even though the Bulldogs were 14-point favorites at BetMGM, the largest spread for a national semifinal game in at least 25 years, it's another round of bettors loading up on Gonzaga.

Of all the money bet on the Gonzaga-UCLA game at BetMGM, 79 percent is on Gonzaga laying a huge number.

That pattern follows the first four rounds of the NCAA tournament. Bettors haven't lost on Gonzaga yet.

Gonzaga has covered in each tournament game

Despite having the largest spread in each of the first four rounds, Gonzaga has covered the spread in each of their four tournament games. In three of the games, the cover was never in doubt.

Gonzaga has been the story of the tournament. They got through the season undefeated and are two wins from being the first undefeated champion in 45 years.

The Bulldogs' dominance has been impressive. UCLA is an 11 seed but is coming off wins against Alabama and Michigan, the top two seeds in the East region. BetMGM opened the line for the UCLA game at 13.5 and it was quickly bet up to 14.

The bets on Gonzaga never slowed down despite a spread that would seem more appropriate for the first round, not the Final Four.

Big bet comes in with Gonzaga

One of the biggest bets made in the 24 hours before tipoff was a parlay that included the Gonzaga moneyline, which is -1200. An $88,000 parlay on Gonzaga moneyline and Baylor moneyline (-215) was placed at BetMGM. That bettor would win $52,000 if both No. 1 seeds win Saturday.

The other large bet made at BetMGM just before Saturday's games awas $110,000 to win $100,000 on the Baylor-Houston over, which is 135 points.

Among the other big bets during the week, a couple included Gonzaga:

$308K to win $280K on Baylor -5

$275K to win $250K on Gonzaga -14

$115K to win $100K on Gonzaga -8 first half

The only sure thing in this tournament seems to be that as long as Gonzaga keeps playing, the betting money will be pouring in on them.

"The touching story behind opponents’ hug amid Final Four elation, heartbreak","The shot rimmed out. Hands snapped to heads. South Carolina's Aliyah Boston sank to the floor. And after the most dramatic of Final Four finishes, after inches separated heroism and heartbreak, Stanford players bounded toward their bench. They leapt into one another’s arms. Haley Jones, who’d hit the game-winning jumper, celebrated as jubilantly as anyone.

Then she looked across the court, and paused.

A few dozen feet away, she saw a dear friend. A friend she communicates with almost daily. A friend she’s traveled with, balled with, won a world championship with. A friend who shares her sarcastic, dry sense of humor. A friend she’d texted with just yesterday.

She saw Aliyah Boston, and Boston was distraught. Tears were streaming down her face.

So Jones and teammate Fran Belibi interrupted their celebrations. They weren’t supposed to cross midcourt and mingle with opponents. They sought out a team administrator for an exemption. “Can we go see our friend?” they asked.

They got permission, and sprinted across the floor. Boston fell into their arms. They embraced, and held one another for a few moments.

“So proud of you,” Jones told Boston. “I love you. Keep your head up.”

Boston, with her left arm clutching Jones, and her right arm pulling in Belibi, told them: “Go win the natty now.""

“And right after the game, we're texting each other,” Jones told Yahoo Sports two hours later. “I think that those are the best relationships. Where you're able to compete against your friends, but no matter the win or the loss, nothing changes that relationship.”

The Haley Jones-Aliyah Boston friendship

Jones, Boston and Belibi were born several months apart in 2001 — but thousands of miles apart, separated by an ocean. Boston came to the States from the U.S. Virgin Islands. She starred at a Massachusetts prep school, while Belibi made headlines in Colorado, while Jones grew into an All-American out in the Bay Area.

In 2017, as 15-year-olds, USA Basketball brought them together. Boston and Belibi made the U.S. team that won the FIBA Under-16 World Cup. Jones was named an alternate, and missed out.

Story continues

But the three girls were drawn to one another. They’d roast one another, Jones said, but all in good fun. The following summer, all three made the national team that traveled to Belarus for the Under-17 World Cup. They won it — along with two other future teammates who starred Friday night — and have stayed close ever since.

They now spend most of their time busy, and 2,400 miles apart. But their group chat stays active. They FaceTime when they have free time on weekends. They congratulate one another on strong performances and support one another after shaky ones.

Jones said they’d been in touch throughout the NCAA tournament. But once they clinched a Final Four showdown against each other?

“Oh, barely spoke,” Jones said with a laugh.

They did text on Thursday. In Stanford practice that day, Belibi had been tasked with mimicking Boston on the scout team.

I got to live out my dream and be you, Belibi texted afterward.

I got to live out my dream and block your shot, Jones followed, jokingly.

“But it was business today,” Jones said.

'You never want to see your friend hurting'

For two hours in San Antonio on Friday evening, two of the “best friends” were two of the three best players on a Final Four court.

Boston pulled down 16 rebounds and blocked four shots despite foul trouble.

Jones scored 24 points on only 14 shots. Her clutch jumper with 32 seconds remaining gave Stanford a 66-65 lead.

The game, though, hung on a frantic final possession. South Carolina got a steal. Boston flipped the ball to Brea Beal. Beal drove to the rim, and missed a contested layup. Boston towered above Cardinal players for the rebound. She pushed the ball delicately back toward the hoop. It left her hand with 0.3 seconds on the clock.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

It didn’t go in, and that crushed Boston. She turned around, crouched, and pressed her palms into the hardwood. Disbelief and agony crumpled her face.

Those are the emotions that Jones and Belibi saw, the emotions that pulled them toward their friend, the emotions that compelled them to check in on Boston via text afterward.

They also knew she would’ve done the same for them.

“We have so much love for each other,” Jones said. “And so much respect. … She had a great game, we matched each other's energy tonight. And so after the game, it was just respect and love for her. You never want to see your friend hurting.”

How does Gonzaga’s run for perfection compare to 1975-76 Indiana?,"INDIANAPOLIS – More than four decades have passed since Bob Hammel, the former sports editor of the Bloomington Herald-Times, would rush back from the airport after Big Ten road games, pound out his Indiana basketball column on a typewriter for the afternoon edition and emerge from the office well after sunrise.

He’s a throwback from an era when sportswriters traveled with the team and frequently ate chili and pie with Bob Knight at local diners.

With Gonzaga in Indianapolis attempting to become the first Division I men’s team to complete an entire season and postseason undefeated since the 1976 Indiana Hoosiers, few are more qualified to link eras than the man who most diligently chronicled college basketball’s last undefeated team.

“I think that’s the best year any college team ever had,” said Hammel, 84, in a phone interview this week. “It won’t be superseded by what Gonzaga may do. Partly because all the things that were out of Gonzaga’s hands.”

A conversation with Hammel is a peek into the soul of basketball in the state of Indiana, via a time when copy traveled by Western Union. He worked as the sports editor for the Bloomington Herald-Times for 30 years, covered 23 Final Fours and authored or co-authored 11 books. Amid his starry career, covering the Indiana team of Scott May, Quinn Buckner and Tom Abernethy remains a definitive highlight. “It was a professional pleasure,” he said. “You got to see Hamlet that many times.”

A comparison of teams more than four decades apart is largely a futile exercise, as so much changed — the installation of the 3-point line, the addition of conference tournaments and the proliferation of players toe-touching college before heading off to the NBA.

But Hammel helped roar back to life the greatness of Indiana during that time, accomplishments so significant that the former players feel no need to root against the Zags. While this Gonzaga team has been linked to undefeated chatter since early in the season, that Indiana team was chasing the ghost of the disappointment from the 1974-1975 season. That Hoosier team was so elite that four players made the five-man All-Big Ten team.

Story continues

But Scott May’s broken arm late in the season derailed Indiana in the 1975 NCAA tournament, which suffered its only loss to Kentucky in the Mideast Region final. Hammel said he’s heard Knight say over the years that the 1975 team was better, but his answer later evolved to the 1976 team. “It’s a real argument,” Hammel said. “They were both really good teams.”

The strength of the 1975-76 team was apparent immediately. One of the first games that Hammel mentioned in contextualizing the 1976 title team was an exhibition against the Soviet Union National Team at Market Square Arena. The Soviet team had two starters from the 1972 gold medal team, and IU blew it out, 94-78, in front of more than 17,000 fans.

Indiana opened the season with UCLA, the first season after John Wooden’s tenure. Indiana won that game by 20. IU then snuck by Notre Dame, 83-80, in the third game. Hammel recalled Knight’s famous line after a languid performance: “This team needs an enema.” Hammel added: “I suspect they got one.”

The Hoosiers didn’t run through their undefeated season with the same dominance as the current Gonzaga team, which has won 29 of 30 games by double-digits. IU needed overtime to beat Kentucky in Louisville, beat St. John’s by seven in Madison Square Garden and needed a furious comeback to beat Michigan in overtime at home in February.

Indiana finished the Big Ten season undefeated for the second straight year, capping that run with a 29-point home win over Ohio State. Overall, the Hoosiers beat 11 top 20 teams in 1975-76. (Gonzaga has beaten six teams ranked in the AP Top 25.)

“The true joy we got as a team for the most part was when we clinched our fourth Big Ten championship and when we played Marquette at LSU for the regional to go to the Final Four,” said Jim Crews, a senior on the team who became a long-time college basketball coach. “Those were really happy moments. The national championship was more of a relief, really. The others were really happy.”

When Indiana did reach the Final Four in Philadelphia, the storyline of the team going undefeated wasn’t nearly the din of Gonzaga’s current run to perfection. Part of that came from the relative normalcy of an undefeated season — Indiana was the seventh team in 20 years to pull it off.

“I think the furthest thing from our mind was that this would be an oddity,” said Abernethy, a senior on that IU team who owns the Indiana Basketball Academy. “We did it. It had been done by some of the UCLA teams and other teams before us. It’s become sort of a phenomenon that’s developed over the decades.”

Knight was 36 when IU won that title in Philadelphia and he told Hammel postgame that he was taking a train to Washington, D.C. to recruit at a high school all-star game. “They pay me pretty well at Indiana,” Knight told Hammel, “and they don’t pay me to relax.”

Only five teams have emerged from the regular season and conference tournament undefeated since then: Indiana State (1978-79); UNLV (1990-91); Wichita State (2013-14); Kentucky (2014-15); and Gonzaga’s current crew. (Hammel points out that both UNLV and Kentucky lost in Indianapolis and also that every title team since Indiana has lost at least two games.)

As the years have passed and that Indiana team has become the standard for undefeated teams, the players made clear that that team doesn’t define their identity. They aren’t group texting about it or celebrating another team losing.

Abernethy said that he, Buckner and May visited Knight last week in his home. Knight is 80 and the three players spent two hours with Knight where both the IU coaching search and Gonzaga’s undefeated season failed to come up.

“In a number of ways, you can’t allow yourself to be defined by what someone else does that is compared to what you did,” Abernethy said. “It’d be a real tough life to navigate that way.”

Knight’s son Pat said that Gonzaga coach Mark Few and his dad bonded over the years over basketball and fishing. Few would call to talk hoops and sought Knight’s advice when suitors called while he was at Gonzaga (including once when Knight famously told him to turn down a job using some colorful language).

Pat Knight said his dad has enjoyed watching Gonzaga because of the way they move the ball. “That’s the sad thing,” Pat Knight told Yahoo Sports. “If he wasn’t 80 and having the effects of old age, he’d be rooting for Few.”

Crews, who coached college basketball for nearly 40 years, said he’s also actively rooting for Gonzaga. “How many times do they actually dribble the ball,” he said. “It’s like they have a rule that they can’t dribble more than three times. They have more passes than dribbles, which is the absolute opposite of the way the vast, vast, vast majority of teams in college basketball play. Just how they play the game is awesome.”

Hammel admits with a chuckle that the general tenor of Indiana fans may not be the same toward Gonzaga. “They aren’t the most popular team in the world here,” he said. “That’s natural, of course.”

What’s not intuitive is how the 1976 Indiana team has refused to let that lone undefeated season be anything more than a great year. They don’t pop champagne like the undefeated 1972 Dolphins. They don’t root against teams that have come close to matching them.

They come from a throwback era where they are comfortable enough with their own accomplishments. “We’re very boring,” Crews said with a laugh. “I’m jealous of the Dolphins. I admire them. We’re very boring.”

A team from another era has been brought back to life by a modern team that’s on the cusp of being one of the sport’s defining champions. And maybe what’s best is that more than four decades later, there’s more mutual appreciation than comparison.

He may have a point, but there are more games to be played. Whenever Kevin Durant (hamstring) returns, Harden will have time to prove that he’s still the MVP of the league.

James: 25.4 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 7.9 apg

BetMGM odds: +900

Embiid: 29.9 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 3.3 apg

BetMGM odds: +800

These two candidates are close to falling out of the Top 5 due to extended absences. Embiid has been out since March 12 with a bone bruise in his knee, and James has been sidelined since March 20 with a high ankle sprain. The Philadelphia 76ers are getting their star back this weekend, while the Los Angeles Lakers still have some time before James returns. But time is running out for their MVP cases, especially for James.

Momentum: Downward

The Denver Nuggets center has moved up two slots from my last installment. He’s arguably been the most consistent candidate all season. And he’s receiving help (Aaron Gordon acquisition) at the right time to build on his case. In a very wide-open race, Jokic has as good a chance as any to make history by being the first Nugget to win MVP.

BetMGM odds: +1200

The Portland Trail Blazers’ franchise guard earns the top spot. His durability (even though he’s dealing with a litany of injuries), his unmatched clutch prowess, his load carrying and his leadership have kept the Trail Blazers in playoff contention while their second- and third-best players were sidelined for significant portions of the season. The Norman Powell deal should help Portland climb the standings, and if so, Lillard could snag the franchise’s first MVP award since Bill Walton received the honor 43 years ago.

Rookie Snapshot 2021: Javonte Williams fantasy football profile,"Javon Williams, RB, North Carolina Tar Heels

Size: 5-foot-10 and 220 pounds

Age: 20-years-old (4/25/2000)

Background

A North Carolina native, Williams flourished as a two-sport athlete at Wallace-Rose Hill High School. In 2016, he won the Bulldogs a state title in the 4x100 meter relay. Two years later, he helped the varsity football squad secure their fourth-straight state championship. In that contest, he scored a 73-yard touchdown on the game’s first play.

Not bad for a kid who played linebacker until his senior year.

But athletics weren’t Williams’ only focus. He graduated as the school’s valedictorian, earning a 4.6 GPA.

Despite all of that success, he received a startlingly small amount of attention over the recruiting process. However, eventually (after then-coach Larry Fedora witnessed the aforementioned 73-yard score), UNC offered him a scholarship. And the local kid has continued to make better than good.

Pros: Head-shaking contact balance; an aggressive runner who doesn’t just break tackles but busts them; strikingly elusive

(Per PFF, Williams recorded the most forced missed tackles at the highest rate among any college running back in the last 7 years)

Cons: Sufficient but not eye-popping long speed; never commanded a full workload in college

The Big Picture

In possession of a build perfectly suited for the position, Williams’ low center of gravity in tandem with a relentless running style makes him an absolute chore to take down. He’s got undeniable power, but pushing the pile isn’t the 20-year-old’s only skill. He’s also a remarkably versatile talent whose instincts are evident via his footwork and elusiveness, all of which continually help him evade tacklers, get to the next level, and rack up YAC.

The only part of Williams’ game that doesn’t “wow” is his long speed. Recording a 4.58 40-yard-dash time at UNC’s Pro Day, Williams is neither a burner nor a plodder.

His overall athletic profile, however, cannot be understated. In fact, PFF credited him with the highest rushing grade in a single season (95.9) since the analytics group began covering college players.

Story continues

Given the level of competition he’s faced and the fact that he’s existed in a timeshare for the bulk of his career means there might be a slight adjustment period for Williams. But make no mistake, this is a kid with a do-it-all skill set who can absolutely thrive as a featured back in the NFL. And, frankly, the fact that he shared touches with Michael Carter in college also means there’s much more left in the tank.

I don’t know if it happens in September or October (landing spot is, obviously, key), but Williams will be fantasy relevant in 2021.

NFL Comp: Nick Chubb at his ceiling. David Montgomery at his floor.

Fantasy Fit

With Kenyan Drake off to Las Vegas, the Cardinals are in need of an RB1. While Williams isn’t as speedy as Drake, he could bring a much-needed toughness to Arizona’s backfield.

Some might say he’s not enough of a compliment to Chase Edmonds, but based on the Cards’ backfield efficiency numbers (using Next Gen Stats’ EFF metric, Drake was inside the league’s 20 least-efficient RBs last year despite facing a light front on nearly 48 percent of his carries) a compliment is not the answer.

Were Williams to land in Glendale, he’d be in line for 15+ touches per contest … and an early season impact would become entirely likely.

Baseball's longest-awaited opening day brings reminders of bliss — and of COVID-19 reality,"The plan was to have three opening days in one.

For the first time since the end of the 2019 season, ballparks across the country would host fans in front of the hometown team. During the latter rounds of the 2020 postseason, played in Arlington, Texas, the Rangers’ new ballpark sold a limited set of pod seats despite the spiking coronavirus numbers at the time. Six months later, baseball was poised to usher in a post-pandemic summer.

The players got what they wanted: adherence to the original April 1 start to the season. Owners got what they wanted: seats sold at every stadium, to varying capacity. And because of a robust vaccine rollout and the herculean efforts of scientists and health care workers, it seemed like we might even be able to celebrate these facts without too many caveats. Baseball is back, and so is the experience of watching a game. Fifteen of them were scheduled to be played on April 1, 2021. And I was planning to be at one-fifth of them.

The day did not go according to plan.

Braving the conditions at Yankee Stadium

I told my editor that I wouldn’t write about the weather. But it is 40 degrees and raining in the Bronx at 10:30 a.m. It is not tailgate weather, it is not drink-beers-before-noon weather, it is barely baseball weather except when you consider that a couple of years ago the Yankees’ home opener was snowed out because this is what early April in New York does at the worst possible time.

Despite the wet chill, some significant portion of the 10,850 fans that the Yankees are admitting to start the season have arrived 2 1/2 hours before first pitch to act like it is tailgate weather.

“Honestly, if I didn't have a ticket, I still would have came here to be in the parking lot,” says a fan who calls himself Fast C and won’t give me his real name. He’s 48 and says he hasn’t missed an opening day in over 20 years.

Except, of course, last year.

He would have gone then, too, if they’d let him, and he feels plenty comfortable now with the safety measures. If anything, “it's a little over and beyond,” he says.

Story continues

“Like all the protocols they have, it was a nightmare.”

At Yankee Stadium, fans and media members must show proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test. A small army of staff patrols the pavilions just outside the gates to make this feasible and as fast as possible. They wield thermometers, and check documentation, or else issue repetitive reminders.

With an intonation usually saved for hawking hot dogs and beer: “Please have your vaccination cards out with your ID. Or your test results out with your ID. Seventy-two hours or rapid.”

The whole thing runs surprisingly smoothly.

“We had to take a rapid antigen this morning,” says Jason Rivera, who was there with his son. “It was worth it for us, to be here and be part of history.”

He calls it birthright for his family, which has had season tickets since 1997. Last year, at home on Long Island, they took the TV outside to watch a belated opening day played in an empty stadium.

“Missed being here though, that's for sure,” he says.

It’s a sentiment echoed succinctly by a sign that says “JUST HAPPY TO BE HERE” made by Lia Bella and Michael Mayer.

“We're just happy for the opportunity,” Bella says. “We're happy to socially distance, we're happy to get tested or whatever you need to do to give a little bit of semblance of normalcy back to everything. It's been a really tough year for a lot of people.”

I meet a 2-year-old named John Derek, after Jeter, attending his first ever Yankees game, along with 10 family members and their friends. Also New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang is there. And then it’s time to hit the road.

Reason to be raucous in Philly

It’s 107 miles from Yankee Stadium to Citizens Bank Park in South Philly. I arrive after the afternoon game is already underway. This is my home field. I grew up 15 minutes away and have seen dozens or maybe hundreds of games here. It’s what I picture when I picture myself at a game.

The media entrance lets you out onto the concourse, and it felt like stepping back in time or into a movie.

That sounds like sap and trying to make something new out of a cliche, but it was more visceral than sentimental. Suddenly immersed in a sensory experience that I forgot I still remembered. It smelled like a ballgame, like a day I might have had before the pandemic ever happened.

The boos were the best part. Fake fans on a soundtrack don’t boo, but Philly fans do and I loved every one of them. They boo the umpire who calls Bryce Harper out at third and boo the replay that upholds the call. They boo Alec Bohm when he misplays a ball and roar back in joy when he makes a leaping catch to rob the Braves’ Marcell Ozuna.

Of course they boo Ozuna and Ronald Acuña Jr.

“I like to heckle the outfielders, in a good way,” says Oscar Alvarado. “It felt good to see Ozuna interact with the fans.”

Alvarado is one of the two founders of the Phandemic Krew that rose to fame as some of the only fans in baseball to cheer on their team in person in 2020. After they spent the entire 60-game season last summer pressed up against the outfield gate, the Phillies rewarded their loyalty by letting the Krew into the ballpark ahead of all the other fans, the first of 8,800.

“We had one more air horn can, the last one,” says Alvarado. “So we aired it up, left it outside and came in.”

This time last year, Alvarado was at work, a retail manager at a big-box store, streaming old World Series games while counting the number of customers allowed inside. His co-founder, Brett MacMinn, was watching the 2019 opening day broadcast with his wife and parents. Now, they’re at their first of 82 home games in a dedicated Krew section and people ask for their autographs.

When there are fans in the stands, a two-out ninth-inning Harper at-bat in a tied game just feels different. When he strikes out, it hurts in the air. And when they walk it off an inning later, someone shouts, “162-0, baby!”

‘It’s still here’

By then I was supposed to be on a train to Washington, D.C. to catch the night game where the Nationals would finally get to raise their 2019 championship banner and the Mets would debut their new franchise shortstop — a dynamic matchup for the third of three opening days. There were supposed to be 5,000 fans who hadn’t seen their team since it won a World Series on the road.

Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo announced on Wednesday that there had been a positive COVID-19 test among the Washington players. He said they would have to make some roster moves to accommodate the positive player and those deemed close contacts, but they expected to play opening day as intended.

Except that’s the problem with communicable viruses — once you start gathering, for work or to play a game, they can spread. On Thursday morning, there were two more confirmed positive tests and the scheduled primetime opener was postponed. A fourth player was suspected positive as well. Rizzo mandated his whole team isolate while MLB conducts its contact tracing. Until that’s done, they won’t play.

“It’s still here,” Nats manager Dave Martinez said over a Zoom call after the game had been officially banged. Citing an abundance of caution, a press release said that it won’t be made up on Friday either. Beyond that, no one knows when their season will start. Just because the tickets are sold doesn’t mean it’s safe to play.

“We’re still in the midst of a pandemic and people need to still take this seriously,” Martinez said. “They really do.”

Clippers seek bounce-back win over Lakers,"The Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers meet for the first time Sunday since the season opener, when the Clippers defeated the Lakers on the night the Lakers received their championship rings.

Though much has changed since that night, both teams are still considered contenders to represent the Western Conference for this year's NBA Finals.

The Lakers (31-18) have been dealt injuries to two of their top players in LeBron James and Anthony Davis. James has been out two weeks nursing a right, high-ankle sprain suffered on March 20 against the Atlanta Hawks. The Lakers are 3-5 without him in the lineup.

Davis has missed a total of 26 games this season, the last 21 due to a strained right calf. The two superstars remain out indefinitely.

In their absence, the Lakers have leaned on the trio of Dennis Schroder, Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell, as they have averaged nearly 54 points a game during the month of March.

Lakers coach Frank Vogel said he spoke with shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope before his team's win on Friday in Sacramento, asking him to look for his shot more with James and Davis out.

Caldwell-Pope responded with 13 points against the Kings on 4-of-7 shooting from the 3-point line, in addition to grabbing 10 rebounds in a 115-94 win.

""When AD (Davis) and LeBron went down -- I wouldn't say pressure -- but we had to step up a little more than usual,"" Caldwell-Pope said. ""We needed more scorers out there. And just me not being aggressive enough, not taking enough shots, not hunting shots. But tonight, I wanted to just be aggressive.""

Sunday will be the Lakers' last game in Los Angeles before leaving for a five-game road trip that starts in Toronto on Tuesday. After losing four in a row, the Lakers have won three of their last four games.

The Clippers (32-18) have had to figure out how to win consistently without starting point guard Patrick Beverley (right knee soreness) and big man Serge Ibaka (lower back soreness). Those two have missed a combined 31 games due to injury.

Story continues

However, the Clippers have their two superstars in the lineup to lean on in Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.

Leonard is averaging 25.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 4.9 assists a game, while George has contributed 22.3 points, 6.3 rebounds and 5.5 assists a game. George also has been dealing with a lingering toe issue.

Along with those two, Terance Mann and Luke Kennard have stepped up to fill the void offensively, averaging 20.4 points a game off the bench during the month of March.

The Clippers are in the middle of a nine-game homestand; they are 2-2 so far at Staples Center during that stretch, having lost the last two games against the Orlando Magic and Denver Nuggets.

The Clippers hope veteran point guard Rajon Rando will take the floor for the first time since joining the team in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks last week. Rajon has been working his way back from right abductor soreness. The Clippers held a practice on Saturday, giving head coach Tyronn Lue an opportunity to see how Rondo meshes with the team.

""We just need to keep playing with the consistency we've been playing with over the last eight to 10 games,"" Lue said, when asked what he expects to see from the team for the rest of the regular season. ""Once we get everybody back and start understanding what we need to do -- which we understand but start doing what we need to do -- and getting guys back and healthy, we'll be fine.""

"Here's when Lakers, Clippers, Kings fans will be allowed to return to Staples Center","Fans of the Lakers, Clippers and Kings likely will be attending games at Staples Center within two weeks under new state guidelines for spectators at indoor events. (Harry How / Getty Images)

One of basketball’s most storied rivalries, two teams who fueled the NBA’s growth over a decade, will be on the court in front of fans at Staples Center on April 15, the first time professional basketball has had spectators in Los Angeles in more than a year.

The Lakers will host the Boston Celtics on the date new state guidelines permit large indoor gatherings at sporting events.

“We are incredibly excited that the State of California announced guidelines today that will allow Lakers fans to return to Staples Center,” the Lakers said in a statement. “Now that we have the guidance, we will work with LA County Public Health and Staples Center to finalize our plans to have fans safely attend our games starting with the Lakers vs. Celtics game on April 15.

“We look forward to welcoming Lakers fans back to Staples Center to continue the journey with us to defend our NBA title.”

State guidelines released Friday allowed for indoor venues to begin returning fans to arenas under the following rules:

Testing or proof of vaccination would be required and capacity limited to 20% in the red tier. The threshold would be 10%, or 2,000 people, in the orange tier — and could increase further to 35% if all attendees are tested or show proof of full vaccination. The cap is also set at 10%, or 2,000 people, in the yellow tier, though capacity in those cases could increase to 50% if all guests are tested or fully vaccinated.

Staples Center and its teams said they will work with the state and county to finalize procedures to ensure fan safety.

""That’s going to be super exciting for our whole community,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""I know our guys, our coaches, our organization internally will be really excited about it. I think the players on the floor will notice the energy that our fans bring. Obviously we don’t know exactly how many fans will be there yet but just having some in there will bring us great energy and I’m just happy for the L.A. community. It’s one of everybody’s favorite things to do is go to Lakers games and they haven’t been able to do that during this pandemic. So just really excited about this news.""

Story continues

The Lakers haven’t unfurled their 2020 NBA championship banner, vowing to do so only when fans are back in the building.

Both the Clippers and the Kings are making similar plans for fans.

The Clippers are planning on having some fans in the building on April 18 against the Timberwolves.

“With the State of California announcing that Los Angeles County has moved into the orange tier, we will continue working closely with the L.A. County Department of Public Health and Staples Center to determine the guidelines for safely hosting fans at Clippers home games this season,” the Clippers said in a statement. “With the new guidelines in place, we are planning for a certain number of fans to attend our game against Minnesota on April 18.”

The Kings have targeted April 20 against the Ducks for their first game with fans.

“We are thrilled that the state of California has now released the guidance that will allow us to have fans return to Kings games at Staples Center starting on April 20 versus Anaheim,” the Kings said. “Now that we have this information, we will be able to work with our local health officials at LA County to provide information to our fans in the coming week as to how they will be able to attend our games. This is exciting for our players and our fans.”

The Ducks will host fans on April 16 against the Vegas Golden Knights at Honda Center in Anaheim.

Staples Center has been without paid fans since the Lakers played the Brooklyn Nets on March 10, 2020. The following day, Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 before a game in Oklahoma City, essentially signaling the start of the pandemic in the country.

The Kings hosted Ottawa on March 11, their season getting shut down the following day.

NBA teams have been allowed to have limited personnel at games this season. For the past week, the Lakers have been allowing limited-admittance player guests.

As of Friday, 20 NBA teams were allowing fans to attend games, ranging in capacity from 750 to 5,542.

Opinion: The gutless Atlanta Braves put themselves on the wrong side of history,"If you want to know what courage looks like, look at Major League Baseball right now. They saw the naked, jingoistic racism of voter suppression in Georgia, and in response, decided to move this year's All-Star game from the state.

""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport,"" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Friday, ""is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft.""

That's what guts look like.

If you want to know what total capitulation looks like, what cowardice looks like, what the wrong side of history looks like, what running scared looks like, what you will use as an example to your kids of how not to act, look no further than the Atlanta Braves.

After baseball released its statement, the Braves released theirs, and I'm surprised they were able to use a laptop with their fingers shaking so much from fear of the voting suppression extremists.

“This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,"" the statement said. ""The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion. Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community. Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.""

This isn't just tone deaf. Look up tone deaf in the dictionary and there are the Braves smoking a cigarette.

The Braves moved to their new ballpark in 2017.

First, the idea that Atlanta has always been a ""uniter"" shows a level of historical ignorance that is stunning from people who should know better. Atlanta may have been the center of the civil rights movement but to say it has always been a ""uniter"" is a farce. No city in the South has always been a ""uniter."" No city in America has.

Story continues

Second, their statement is acceptance of the racism of the new voting restrictions enacted by Republicans. There's no other way to look at it. Either you are for democracy or you are not.

You will hear all the coded language and lies about ""cancel culture"" and other nonsense, but what baseball did was position itself on the side of true American values.

This is an existential crisis and the Braves failed to meet the moment.

But Manfred did and his actions can be a call to action for everyone.

He gave sports leagues and businesses a roadmap on how to fight. The NFL, NBA and NCAA have said little since the voting restrictions went into place. Major businesses like Coca-Cola and Delta have released statements but taken no actions.

Only baseball has demonstrated the proper amount of guts, and it's glorious to see.

The Falcons could take similar steps by moving some of their games. The Hawks, too. The NFL could easily, and I mean easily, declare it will never hold a Super Bowl in Atlanta until voting rights are restored. The SEC could do the same with its championship game.

It is true that such boycotts would financially impact some working people of Atlanta like concession stand workers and businesses that thrive off the crowds attending the games. But those same people are having their access to voting diminished with a bevy of suppression laws.

Two key parts of the new restrictions gives the Republican-controlled state government the power to assert control over elections in Democratic counties. The new restrictions also limit how voters can receive food and drink within a certain vicinity of a voting location.

These are draconian tactics and astoundingly anti-democratic. They are un-American in every way. No American should want them.

Manfred did the right thing in fighting these laws. Every sport, every business in the country, could learn from what Manfred did.

They could also learn from the Braves, on what not to do.

On what gutlessness looks like.

MLB To Move All-Star Game Out Of Atlanta In Response To Georgia Voting Laws,"MLB will move the 2021 All-Star Game and MLB Draft out of Atlanta as a consequence of Georgia’s restrictive new election laws, Commissioner Rob Manfred announced Friday.

“Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views,” Manfred said in a statement. “I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB Draft.”

“Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,” he added.

It’s unclear where the All-Star Game, originally scheduled for July 13 at Atlanta’s Truist Park, will be held.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms met the news with grim resignation.

“Just as elections have consequences, so do the actions of those who are elected,” she tweeted Friday. “Unfortunately, the removal of the MLB All Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall, until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed.”

The Atlanta Braves said they were “deeply disappointed” by MLB moving events from their city, but came out in support of voting rights.

“This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,” the team said in a statement. “The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion.”

Newly elected Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) also denounced the MLB’s decision for unnecessarily punishing the people of Georgia, and he condemned the law that prompted the league’s move.

“It is my hope that businesses, athletes, and entertainers can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming here and fighting voter suppression head on, and hand-in-hand with the community,” he said in a statement.

Story continues

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), meanwhile, responded with a fearmongering rant on Twitter, characterizing the relocation as an “attack on our state” and warning Georgians that “cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included.” (Kemp aggressively purged voters that didn’t serve his party while serving as Georgia’s secretary of state, canceling 1.4 million voter registrations between 2012 and 2018.)

In an interview with ESPN on Wednesday, President Joe Biden told SportsCenter host Sage Steele he would be supportive if MLB decided to decamp for a more hospitable state.

“The very people who are victimized the most are the people who are leaders in these very sports,” Biden told ESPN. “And it’s just not right. This is Jim Crow on steroids, what they’re doing there in Georgia and 40 other states.”

Last week, Georgia’s Republican-controlled government pushed through sweeping new restrictions that limit access to the ballot box. Among other things, the law imposes strict voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, limits ballot drop-box locations, gives the legislature greater control over elections, and criminalizes offering food and water to voters standing in line.

Georgia lawmakers feeling corporate pressure

Baseball's move comes after corporations have spoken out against Georgia's new law that severely curtails voting access across the state and even makes it impermissible to provide food and water to voters waiting in line. The bill was passed by Georgia's Republican-majority state legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and was introduced in the wake of Democratic wins in November and January runoff elections.

Atlanta-based companies Coca-Cola, Delta, and Home Depot had come out against the law publicly earlier in the week. The CEO of Delta said in a company memo obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the law was ""unacceptable"" and ""based on a lie"" that widespread voter fraud impacted the outcome of the statewide elections in Georgia.

Evidence of voter fraud has not been substantiated and multiple recounts of President Joe Biden's November win in the state were conducted. Biden recently said that he would support the game being moved to another state in response to the law.

All-Star Game awarded to Truist Park in 2019

Atlanta has been prepping to host the 2021 All-Star Game since it was awarded to the city and Truist Park in 2019. The game was given to Atlanta after the opening of Truist Park — formerly SunTrust Park — ahead of the 2017 season. The Braves' new stadium replaced Turner Field.

Truist Park is located in an unincorporated area of Cobb County northwest of downtown Atlanta. Turner Field, now the home of Georgia State's football team, is located in Fulton County in Atlanta.

NBA All-Star Game once moved out of Charlotte

Baseball's move of its All-Star Game is not unprecedented. The NBA moved its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte after North Carolina passed a law that limited discrimination protections against LGBTQ people and, namely, forced transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponded with the sex on their birth certificates.

The game was ultimately played in Charlotte in 2019 after parts of the law — including the bathroom provision — were repealed in 2017 after public pressure.

The NFL also moved the 1993 Super Bowl from Phoenix after voters in the state of Arizona voted in 1991 to not make Martin Luther King Day a holiday.

"After Roy Williams' retirement, here are 5 candidates to replace him at UNC","The last time the University of North Carolina job opened, the Tar Heels hired the coach from a blue-blood school who had won 418 games in a major conference and coached in the national title game that year.

Now that Roy Williams is departing from North Carolina after 18 seasons, it’s unlikely that the Tar Heels are going to be able to lure a coach with that much success. The obvious names like Gonzaga’s Mark Few, Villanova’s Jay Wright and former Butler coach Brad Stevens likely aren’t going anywhere.

Who will UNC turn to? AD Bubba Cunningham offered some clues on Thursday, saying that he’s not going to limit his list to the so-called Carolina family. UNC is famously myopic, but it’s important to remember that Williams’ stagnant staff put together the roster that had UNC bumbling in 2019-20 (14-19, 6-14 in the ACC) and posting a pedestrian season in 2020-21 (18-11, 10-6).

Is more of the same the answer for one of the best jobs in the sport? (At worst, it’s a consensus top-three job.) So who could UNC turn to?

Here’s a quick list of candidates:

Tony Bennett, Virginia

It’s unlikely Tony Bennett is going to depart UVA, which he’s led to unprecedented success and has shown nothing but intense fidelity toward. But it’s worth a call. Virginia has won or shared three of the last four regular season ACC crowns, and the best way to get UNC back atop the ACC is to hire the coach who has been the best recently. Again, this is a Hail Mary.

Chris Holtmann, Ohio State

He’s one of the best movable coaches in the sport, and his low-key personality would fit well with the Carolina ethos. He’s 6-for-6 in reaching NCAA men's tournaments in his years at Butler and Ohio State. (He’d have been 7-for-7 if there’d been a tournament in 2020.) Experience as head coach at Gardner-Webb gives him in-state familiarity.

Porter Moser, Loyola Chicago

He’s been judicious about jobs, but this is one that he couldn’t say no to. Moser has emerged as one of the country’s top tactical coaches, evaluators and developers of talent. His image would appeal to the Carolina brand. His Final Four run in 2018 and Sweet 16 run this year have elevated him into the top tier of the sport’s elite.

Story continues

Hubert Davis, UNC assistant

When calling around and handicapping candidates, Davis is the presumptive industry favorite. He’s a popular former player, a known commodity from his NBA career and a familiar face from ESPN. He’s been a Carolina assistant for nine years and would be a preferred “Carolina family” candidate. He was an assistant on the 2017 title winning staff, but has also been a staff member for the recent downtick. UNC also hasn’t gotten past the Sweet 16 since that title, including three blowout tournament losses. Would his elevation require a staff shakeup?

Wes Miller, UNC Greensboro

He’s the other popular “family” choice, as he’s spent 10 years at UNC-Greensboro and won more than 20 games each of the last five years. He’s reached two NCAA men's tournaments, including this season. Miller played at UNC from 2004-07, including on the 2005 title team, and would be the UNC family candidate with the most head coaching experience.

Roy Williams' reason for retiring: 'I no longer feel that I am the right man for the job',"When one of the greatest coaches in college basketball history — a man with 903 wins, nine Final Fours, three national championships — retires, the farewell news conference is typically a victory lap.

In the case of Roy Williams, it was a postmortem.

""15 years at Kansas, I thought I was the right man. This time at North Carolina, I thought I was the right man,"" Williams said. ""I no longer feel that I am the right man for the job.""

The UNC coaching great announced his retirement on Thursday after nearly five decades of coaching, a career that took him from Charles D. Owen High School to head coach at two of college basketball's biggest blue bloods. The announcement triggered a predictable waves of tributes and well-wishes for a man respected across the sport. In fact, maybe the harshest criticism of Williams came from the man himself when addressing reporters at the Dean Smith Center.

Speaking with tears in his eyes, Williams said his biggest reason for retiring, beyond more time with his wife Wanda and family, was that he simply doesn't think he's good enough to coach UNC:

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

Yes, I want to see my children and grandchildren more. I want to give Wanda more time. I still don’t know about getting in an RV and driving across the United States of America, though. I’m all-in for going to baseball parks with the grandkids. But the biggest reason we’re having this meeting is I don’t feel that I’m the right man any longer.

I love coaching, working with kids on the court, the locker room, the trips, the Jump Around music, the trying to build a team. I will always love that, and I’m scared to death of the next phase. But I no longer feel that I’m the right man.

For several minutes, Williams went through his lengthy career, noting the best moments and crediting the players who delivered them, but he also went in detail about the less fun times, like the last two seasons in which the Tar Heels went 32-30 with zero wins in the NCAA tournament:

Story continues

The last two years have been really hard. 2020 … the injuries really did hurt, but I felt I made mistakes. We were up 3 against Clemson and I didn’t remind the guys to foul. They make a 3 and send it to overtime and we lost.

We had six games last year that were decided on last-second shots. We lost all 6.

Williams took responsibility for UNC's struggles this season in particular. The team lost to Wisconsin in the first round of March Madness, which snapped Williams' 29-game win streak in the first round of the tournament.

I just never got the team this year where I wanted them to go. I just didn’t get it done. I didn’t get them to buy in and focus on the things that I think are really big in the game of basketball. We got better. All season long, I think we got better, but not to the level some of our times have been. I didn’t push the right buttons.

Such an admission was a surreal sight, though maybe not so much from Williams, a man who seemingly went out of his way to stay humble throughout his career. It's hard to see another coach of his level doing the same, at least.

With Williams' departure, UNC now has to fill one of the biggest jobs in the sport. There will be no shortage of candidates in and out of the Carolina family, but we'll see if the Tar Heels find the right man for the job.

Tar Heels turn attention to hiring Williams' successor,"North Carolina Head Basketball Coach Roy Williams speaks with members of the media during a news conference, Thursday, April 1, 2021, in Chapel Hill, N.C.

North Carolina now faces the challenge of finding Roy Williams’ successor.

The Hall of Fame coach is retiring from the Tar Heels’ storied men’s basketball program, opening the job for the first time in nearly two decades. That leaves athletics director Bubba Cunningham directing the highest-profile coaching search of his nearly decade-long tenure at UNC, with Williams set to have at least some input.

“I believe we’ve got the best job in college basketball,” Cunningham said. “This job doesn’t come open very often. We need to spend a great deal of time thinking about who is the right person right now.”

Williams announced his retirement Thursday, saying he no longer felt like “the right man” for the job over the past two difficult seasons. That ends an 18-season run that included three NCAA titles since he returned to his alma mater after a 15-year run at Kansas.

In a virtual news conference Thursday night, Cunningham said he and chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz would handle the process instead of using a search committee. He said he has sought input from a numerous former players as well as Williams, who Cunningham said had already shared his opinion.

Williams mentioned that, too, during his news conference earlier Thursday.

“I’m putting a lot of load on he and the chancellor’s shoulders because I’m giving my opinion very strongly about what I want to happen with the program,” Williams said.

Cunningham said he prefers head-coaching experience but it isn't required. The same is true of hiring someone with UNC ties, which worked with longtime assistant Bill Guthridge taking over after Dean Smith's 1997 retirement and Williams’ return in 2003 – but didn’t work during the tumultuous tenure of Matt Doherty after Williams turned turned down the job following Guthridge's retirement in 2000.

There are experienced coaches with strong program connections, such as UNC Greensboro's Wes Miller, who played on Williams' 2005 NCAA championship team; Stanford's Jerod Haase, who coached under Williams at UNC; and Hubert Davis, who played for Dean Smith and has spent the past nine seasons on Williams' staff.

Story continues

“The history and tradition here is winning,” Cunningham said. “We’ve had it in the family for a long period of time. That is important. But it’s not the only factor in trying to make a decision like this.”

Cunningham said there is no specific timetable, though he noted UNC moved quickly in hiring Mack Brown for a second stint as football coach after firing Larry Fedora in a process taking only a few days in November 2018. He mentioned an urgency for a new coach to deal with large numbers of college players pursuing transfers, a list that includes UNC freshman 7-footer Walker Kessler.

“It’s going to be a very different environment in coaching, recruiting and retaining students to play on the team,” Cunningham said. “And quite frankly, college basketball is better when North Carolina is good. We need to be good and we’re committed to being good. And now we have to find the right leader that can maintain the standards that we’ve become accustomed to.”

Reports: Dustin Poirier signs agreement for third bout with Conor McGregor in July,"Dustin Poirier’s third bout with Conor McGregor is halfway official.

Poirier, according to ESPN’s Ariel Helwani, signed his share of the fight agreement for the fight that is expected to take place at UFC 264 on July 10.

McGregor confirmed the news Saturday, announcing ""the fight is booked"" on Instagram. McGregor didn't specify who he was fighting, but said the date of the fight was July 10, which lines up with the Poirier rumors.

The location for the fight has not yet been announced, though UFC president Dana White said that the fight is targeted for T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, per MMA Junkie.

McGregor first beat Poirier via a first round TKO at UFC 178 in 2014. Poirier then won their rematch in January with a second-round TKO at UFC 257 in Abu Dhabi.

Though Conor McGregor still needs to sign the deal, the third fight between the two is expected to take place in July. (Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC)

Many thought Poirier would attempt to claim the lightweight title with his next fight, which was left vacant after Khabib Nurmagomedov retired, though Michael Chandler and Charles Oliveira will fight for that belt instead next month at UFC 262.

Poirier, who boasts a 27-6 record, has won six of his last seven bouts — with the lone loss coming at the hands of Nurmagomedov at UFC 242 in 2019. McGregor has lost two of his last three, also dropping a bout to Nurmagomedov in 2018, but did beat Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone in less than a minute in January 2020.

“Dustin – he wants the rematch and that’s smart. That’s what he should do,” White said last month, via MMA Junkie. “He should take the rematch, take that fight. It’s a big fight for him. The kid has worked hard his whole life, his whole career, to be in a position like this – and that’s the fight you take.

“We’ve been in positions like this with others and they made the mistake of not taking that fight, and you know – biggest mistake of their lives.”

Grant Hill will replace Jerry Colangelo as managing director of Team USA after Tokyo Olympics,"The Tokyo Olympics will mark the end of an era for at least one major part of Team USA basketball. Following the Olympics, Grant Hill will replace Jerry Colangelo as managing director of Team USA.

USA Basketball announced the news Saturday. Colangelo has been involved with USA Basketball since 2005. The decision to replace Colangelo with Hill has been in the works for ""several months,"" according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

As managing director, Hill will be tasked with recruiting talent to the program. He'll also have to select Team USA's next coach. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich will manage the team in 2021.

Team USA blossomed under Colangelo, winning gold medals at the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympics and at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, 2010 FIBA World Championship and 2014 FIBA World Cup.

Grant Hill has experience with Team USA

Hill comes to the position with plenty of experience. He was a member of the 1996 Dream Team, which dominated the competition to take home a gold medal in Atlanta.

Hill cited that experience in a statement announcing his hire.

“It is a tremendous honor to serve as managing director of USA Basketball’s Men’s National Team. I am looking forward to working with the USA Basketball staff and Board of Directors to lead this organization so uniquely positioned for continued growth and for developing and promoting our top talent in events around the world,” said Hill. “As a member of the 1996 Dream Team, I know the thrill and responsibility it is to represent our country. I am confident USA Basketball will continue to showcase the top talent and highest character players in our country.”

In addition to playing on the Dream Team, Hill is an NBA Hall of Famer. Hill spent 18 seasons in the NBA. He was a seven-time All-Star and made the All-NBA team five times during his career.

"Nationals reportedly have no new positive COVID-19 tests, could start season soon","The Washington Nationals inched closer Saturday to finally opening the regular season. The team reportedly experienced no new positive COVID-19 results in their latest batch of tests, according to Britt Ghiroli and Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.

The Nationals have yet to open the 2021 MLB season after a positive COVID-19 test prior to the team's opening game. As a result, MLB postponed the team's opener against the New York Mets. There was hope the Nationals could have returned to play Saturday's contest, but the team experienced more positive tests Friday, causing MLB to postpone the entire series.

Saturday's news provides hope the Nationals will be able to open the season Monday against the Atlanta Braves. The team, however, will wait until another round of testing before it restarts team workouts.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

The Nationals are hoping to be cleared for workouts this weekend. It's possible that happens Sunday if the team returns another batch of negative tests.

Nationals will be without players against Braves

If the Nationals are cleared to return to action, they'll be without a handful of players against the Braves. Under 2021 MLB rules, players who test positive for COVID-19 have to isolate for 10 days before they can return. Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo revealed four players on the team have tested positive thus far, though did not name those players.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

Anyone who registers as a close contact to those players will miss seven days, meaning the Nationals could be without a minimum of 9 players for the series. MLB teams can carry a 5-man taxi squad this season to cover for COVID-19 absences. The Nationals would presumably call up all those players against the Braves, but that would still leave Washington a few players short of a full roster.

It's unclear how the Nationals — and MLB — will solve that situation if the team is cleared to play Monday.

Brood X cicadas are coming for the first time in 17 years — and it's going to get loud. How worried should you be?,"Click above on your computer or phone to put a Brood X cicada into your space using Yahoo's augmented reality.

The cicadas are coming and according to scientists, it's a sight — or really, a sound — to behold.

Periodical cicadas — which are found in the Northeast, typically in the central and eastern parts of the U.S. — make an appearance every 17 years. The forthcoming group, known as Brood X, is expected to emerge from the ground in the billions by late April or May when soil levels warm up to about 64 degrees.

Brood X is made up of three different species of cicadas. ""But they all act like one group, one population,"" Nancy Hinkle, professor of entomology at the University of Georgia, tells Yahoo Life.

The Brood X cicada zones are depicted in yellow. (Credit: USDA Forest Service)

How worried should I be about the cicada drone?

The group will crawl out of the ground at night — likely to avoid predators, says Hinkle — in waves over several days. ""They'll crawl up on sticks or tree trunks or fence posts and allow their bodies to harden,"" explains Hinkle. ""Underground they're nymphs and have soft bodies. So they have to shed their skin [or exoskeleton] so their wings will be free. It takes an hour or two [for their adult skin] to harden.""

And once it hits a certain temperature, says Hinkle, the ""singing"" starts — and it's not quiet either. In fact, cicadas are one of the noisiest insects. Their singing can be as loud as 100 decibels — the equivalent of a lawnmower about three feet away. But don’t worry about the singing keeping you up at night — cicadas sing during the day.

""Periodical cicadas do not call at night, unless it is very hot during the night,"" Chris Simon, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut, tells Yahoo Life. ""Since these are spring cicadas, this is less likely.""

Not all cicadas can carry a tune, though. ""Only the males sing and they sing for sex,"" says Hinkle. ""That's how they attract the female."" Each species of male cicadas also makes its own distinct sound. ""You can learn to differentiate between each species just by their sound,"" she explains.

Story continues

The serenading tends to get noisier right before the sun goes down, which is when cicadas call it a night. ""One last shout out before sunset,"" says Hinkle. Think of it as last call at the bar.

What's the best way to deal with incessant cicada singing?

But if the singing is bothersome during the day, especially with so many people now working from home, there are steps you can take. Using noise-canceling devices, machines and apps ""make more sense because the cicadas' sounds are similar to white noise to begin with,"" Dr. Steven Holfinger, a sleep medicine physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life.

Holfinger explains that there are two general categories of noise-canceling — active or passive. ""Passive noise-canceling is when you try to reduce the volume of sounds, for example using earplugs,"" he explains. ""Active noise-canceling is when headphones play the opposite sound wave to cancel the incoming noise. The point of either passive or active noise-canceling is to make the sound that would be bothersome quieter, while white noise is meant to drown out the sounds by making the environment louder. Overall, for cicadas, I would consider wearing a comfortable set of headphones that provide either active or passive noise reduction if the cicadas are too loud.""

However, Holfinger says that ""many people will likely adjust to the sound because it is fairly consistent, similar to white noise, which our minds can drown out if it is not excessively loud."" Or as Hinkle puts it: ""People pay money for white noise generators — here you get it for free!""

What makes Brood X cicadas so special?

Of course, not everyone is a fan of bugs — especially so many at once — but Hinkle suggests embracing the rareness of this event. ""This is our generation’s equivalent of Halley's Comet,"" Hinkle says. ""This is something that only occurs only every 17 years. The chance is strong you’ll probably only experience this only four or five times in your entire life.""

Simon shares Hinkle's enthusiasm: ""They are one of the most amazing natural phenomena in the world!"" And unlike some insects, cicadas are ""perfectly harmless,"" says Hinkle. ""They can't bite and sting. And they’re lousy flyers. They’re pretty lumbering. Kids can catch them and hold them. When they try to sing, they will vibrate in your hand.""

If you live near or within driving distance of where cicadas typically emerge, Hinkle says, ""It's a great opportunity for grandparents to take their grandkids out in nature and experience it together. And when those grandkids grow up they can take their kids.""

Even scientists who have studied cicadas for years find the musical insects captivating. Hinkle shares that she still finds it fascinating that cicadas know to emerge from underground after exactly 17 years. ""It is a mystery,"" she says.

"DMX hospitalized after suffering an overdose, heart attack: report","The Daily Beast

Zach Gibson/GettyIn the days following revelations about the federal investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz’s alleged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, advisers to Donald Trump have consistently offered him a simple message: Please, please keep your mouth shut.According to two people familiar with the matter, the twice-impeached former president has closely been monitoring the scandal engulfing one of his favorite allies on Capitol Hill. The ex-president has, in his typical fashion, casually quizzed several confidants about what they think of the situation and if there’s anything that he should do about it.But multiple people close to Trump have flatly advised him to stay out of it—refrain from publicly defending Gaetz, they are telling him, at least for the time being.The two sources said that, in all of the conversations they’re aware of, Trump has appeared to ultimately agree with the recommendations to keep quiet. One of the sources added that the former president has lamented that the whole thing seems “really bad” for Gaetz, while also mentioning that the allegations could be a “smear” against the Trump uber-loyalist.Gaetz has claimed he’s the victim of a convoluted extortion plot, involving Florida lawyers, $25 million, and a bizarre scheme to free former CIA agent Bob Levinson (who the U.S. government assumes is dead). And yet, despite Gaetz’s claims having some credence, the underlying story that Gaetz is under a Justice Department investigation for a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old also seems credible.In fact, to date, only two House Republicans have really jumped to Gaetz’s defense: Judiciary ranking Republican Jim Jordan (R-OH), who has himself faced allegations that he ignored serial sexual assault, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who seldom misses an opportunity to dismiss media reports and side with Trump-loving Republicans.Gaetz did not respond to a message asking if he’d heard from former President Trump in recent days. And a Trump spokesperson was also silent Friday. But as of Friday evening, Trump and his office had not issued any official statement on the matter.Trump, who was booted from his Twitter account, has not been able to tweet—or retweet—about the Gaetz scandal. And various heavy hitters and luminaries of the Trumpworld diaspora, as well as members of the Trump family, have tried to stay hush about the Republican congressman’s mounting troubles.“I don’t hope for anybody to be guilty of anything, but it sounds like he’s got a lot of explaining to do,” Barry Bennett, a longtime GOP operative and lobbyist who advised Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, said of Gaetz Friday. “People underestimate Donald Trump’s political ear.”Bennett continued that Trump was loyal to those who are loyal to him. But, he said, nobody wants to be associated with a guy who’s been tagged with these sorts of allegations if they end up being true. “For something like this,” Bennett said, “a ten-foot pole is not long enough. The former president should stay as far away from this as possible.”In the past, Trump has barely hesitated when it came to publicly defending prominent allies—or himself—when they’ve been accused of sexual misconduct or assault. But this time around, the allegations seem to ring true for many people close to Gaetz. And every day since the initial story, the scandal has widened and become more explosive.Just on Thursday, it came out that Gaetz is also under investigation for improper use of campaign funds, that he has shown naked pictures of women to fellow lawmakers on the House floor, and that the anchor of the case against him may be a sex ring with an indicted Florida politician.Not exactly the guy you want to jump to defend.As for Rep. Gaetz himself, he’s been one of Trump’s most stalwart promoters and defenders on Capitol Hill. Rarely did he ever find a Trump scandal that he wasn’t ready and willing to combat. But after appearing on Tucker Carlson Tuesday night, Gaetz, just like Trump, appears to have gone quiet, waiting himself for whatever is due to come out next.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

'Primal Fear' at 25: Edward Norton landed Oscar-nominated breakout role after Leonardo DiCaprio passed,"One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.

Such is Hollywood and its long history of missed opportunities and alternate casting tales. And Edward Norton has a doozy of a tale to tell in this genre.

In the early ’90s, the Boston-born, Columbia, Md.-raised actor was working almost exclusively in New York theater when his friend Connie Britton dialed him up from a pay phone.

“She was auditioning for the part that Maura Tierney played in Primal Fear,” Norton told Yahoo Entertainment about the film — which turns 25 Monday — during a 2019 Role Recall interview. “[She] said, ‘They’re seeing people for this role and I have the spookiest feeling it’s made for you.’”

The role — a 19-year-old altar boy accused of killing a Catholic archbishop — wasn’t “fully formed” at the time, Norton said. Maybe it was even trash at that stage. It’s probably why one of the industry’s most in-demand actors didn’t want to take it.

“Leonardo DiCaprio, who’s a really good pal of mine, he had passed on it,” Norton explained. “Weirdly that did a weird thing to me, because of course it’s like, a once-in-a-lifetime career shot. But I thought Leo was terrific, I really thought he was one of the better young actors around. I thought he was right. I was like, ‘This is a mess.’ It was a mess. [Director Greg Hoblit] thought it was a mess, [Richard Gere] kind of thought it was a mess. But then when I came into it, everybody really realized, ‘We really need to fix this.’”

In a 2017 Role Recall interview, Gere told Yahoo Entertainment he was ready to leave the movie until Norton came onboard.

Norton helped fix it from the moment he walked in the door. The young actor arrived at the audition in character as Aaron Stampler, and introduced the murder defendant’s famous stammering — ultimately revealed to be a put-on. The audition tape itself gained so much notoriety that Norton was already cast in projects by Woody Allen (Everyone Says I Love You) and Miloš Forman (The People vs. Larry. Flynt) before Primal Fear even opened on April 5, 1996. Norton’s stunning performance in Primal Fear won the young actor a Golden Globe and netted him an Oscar nomination, an incredibly rare feat for a first-time film star.

Story continues

Today, though, Norton credits co-star Gere — who played the prototypical hero lawyer defending Stampler — for helping shape the role, the film and that satisfying twist.

“These movies teeter on the edge of being B-movies,” Gere told us. “And if they're badly done, they're a bad B-movie. And if they're well done, they transcend their genre. It was really important that we cast this right.”

“Ultimately, Richard, to his enormous credit, he was the one who was like, ‘Stop trying to game this so I don’t lose,'” Norton recounted. “He really was the one who in the end cleared the path for us to lean into the full commitment that this was a complete con.”

Primal Fear is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.

Ken Burns: People are making lots of money off ‘the big lie’ of US election fraud,"Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, known for expansive movies on quintessential American subjects like ""Jazz"" and ""Baseball,"" said in a new interview that former President Donald Trump and his allies have damaged the country by promoting the ""big lie"" of widespread election fraud — and worse yet, they've made money off of it.

Burns said the media environment allows people to make significant amounts of money off of false public comments, and he contrasted such misinformation with his accurate and complex stories about major events and themes of American history.

""There are a lot of people out there making lots of money on [lies], and it's being exploited — and the big lie is part of the combination of that,"" says Burns, whose new three-part film ""Hemingway"" premieres on April 5.

""If you look at the big lie, the ex-president's team raised something like $250 million between the election and the inauguration to just support something that is just factually not true,"" he adds.

'You can't say we're in a post-fact place'

He cited the defense made by former Trump attorney Sidney Powell in a court filing last week that ""no reasonable person"" could believe her false statements about the supposed role of Dominion Voting Systems in election fraud. Dominion is suing Powell, ex-Trump lawyer and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and Fox News for defamation over assertions that the voting machine company rigged the election for President Joe Biden.

""You can't say we're in a post-fact place. It is in the financial interests of a lot of people to promote that,"" Burns says. ""You can't do it. You have to continue to tell the truth.""

Just last week, Trump defended the rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, saying they comprised ""zero threat"" and that law enforcement was ""persecuting"" them. The remarks align with false claims about voter fraud repeated by Trump over the months since he lost the November election, including a public address late last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando where he said the vote was ""rigged.""

Story continues

Trump and the Republican Party raised about $255 million over an eight-plus week period following the Nov. 3 election, a New York Times report found. Moreover, the individuals charged in the Capitol riot upped their political donations by 75% over the five-week period following the election, compared with the five-week period preceding it, NBC News reported.

Filmmaker Ken Burns speaks to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer on ""Influencers with Andy Serwer.""

A U.S. intelligence report released earlier this month said the false election fraud claims spread by Trump will ""almost certainly"" fuel further acts of domestic terrorism this year.

Burns spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer,” a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.

A two-time Oscar nominee, Burns has made made films for four decades on a range of topics that span ""The Vietnam War"" and ""The Civil War"" to ""Country Music"" and ""Brooklyn Bridge."" In addition to the upcoming film ""Hemingway,"" Burns will release later this year ""Muhammad Ali,"" a four-part documentary on the legendary boxer and social activist.

For years, he has lived and worked in the small town of Walpole, New Hampshire.

Former president calls on fans to ‘boycott baseball’Obama lauds MLB ‘for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights’ Mike Pence laughs as Donald Trump holds a baseball bat at the White House in 2017. Photograph: Carlos Barría/Reuters Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson led rightwing backlash after Major League Baseball said it would not play its All-Star game in Georgia because of a new law that restricts voting rights in the state. The former president and the Fox News host some say is his Republican political heir thereby ranged themselves against current president Joe Biden and the Democrat he served as vice-president, Barack Obama. “Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans,” Trump said in a statement, “and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the radical left Democrats. “… Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with free and fair elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta and all?” Coke and Delta are among companies which have expressed concern over the Georgia law, which restricts early and mail-in voting, measures seen to target minority voters likely to back Democrats. Laws under consideration in other Republican-run states have attracted criticism from corporate America. The Georgia law was passed by Republicans after Biden won the state against Trump and Democrats won both Senate runoff elections in January. Referring to the segregation of the post-civil war south, Biden called the law: “Jim Crow in the 21st century.” In his own statement on Saturday, Obama congratulated MLB “for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens”. He also said: “There’s no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example.” Aaron, known as the Hammer, was a long-time MLB home-run record holder who played for the Atlanta Braves and endured racist abuse throughout his life in the sport. He died in January, aged 86. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said he had “decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB draft” from the home of the Atlanta Braves. “Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.” The move was not without precedent. In 2016 North Carolina lost the right to host high-profile NCAA college events over a bill which restricted rights for transgender people. On Friday night Carlson, who some say could be a contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 if Trump does not run again, claimed MLB “believes it has veto power over the democratic process”. Before MLB acted, Biden said he would support moving events from Atlanta. Carlson said that showed the president was “willing to destroy even something as wholesome as the country’s traditional game purely to increase the power of his political party”. The chief of the MLB players union has indicated support for the move. In a statement on Friday, the New York Yankees great and Miami Marlins chief executive Derek Jeter said: “We should promote increasing voter turnout as opposed to any measures that adversely impact the ability to cast a ballot … We support the commissioner’s decision to stand up for the values of our game.” The MLB All-Star Game was due to be held at Truist Park, home of the Atlanta Braves. Photograph: John Amis/AP Georgia governor Brian Kemp – a bête noire for Trump over his refusal to overturn Biden’s win – said MLB had “caved to fear, political opportunism and liberal lies”. He also decried “cancel culture”, a key Republican talking point. Stacey Abrams, who Kemp beat in a 2018 election he ran as Georgia secretary of state, said she was “disappointed” the All-Star game would not be played in the state. But Abrams, who campaigns for voting rights and has become an influential figure in the national Democratic party, also said she was “proud of [MLB’s] stance on voting rights” and “urged events and productions to come and speak out or stay and fight”. Also on Friday, nearly 200 companies signed a statement expressing concern at moves to restrict voting rights in Republican-run states. Many observers pointed out that the political ramifications of MLB’s decision to move the All-Star Game will be stronger than the economic fallout, given that coronavirus-related restrictions would have placed limits on capacity at the event this year. A leading professor of sports economics warned that MLB could risk losing the support of conservatives in a fanbase which skews right. “After the country’s top professional basketball and football leagues embraced the Black Lives Matter movement last year,” Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College told the New York Times, “they faced organised boycotts from conservatives, though the effort ultimately had little effect. And baseball’s fanbase is older and whiter than basketball’s or football’s.”",

Man slammed for 'nightmare' proposal at Disney World: 'This isn't funny anymore',"The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Indiana snapshot: Single-class tourney still looms large,"FILE - Hinkle Fieldhouse is shown in the second half of an NCAA college basketball game between Butler and Marquette in Indianapolis, in this Jan. 18, 2014, file photo.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Bill Butcher and Bobby Plump grew up a generation apart and in remarkably similar worlds when it came to basketball in their home state of Indiana.

Both produced movie-script moments by leading their small school teams to the state finals. And both also remember scrambling to get the Sunday newspaper all those years ago to do something any college basketball fan can still relate to: They wanted to fill out their brackets, not for the NCAA Tournament but for Indiana's fabled single-class tournament.

Watching 68 teams battling for the NCAA title entirely in Indiana has brought back a flood of memories for people like Butcher and Plump, and comparisons to the state’s long-gone tournament format so familiar to the casual basketball fan because of “Hoosiers.”

Before March Madness, there was Hoosier Hysteria and it reigned supreme.

“When I played, there were over 400 teams playing for one state title and every tournament game was in the paper,"" said Butcher, who played for his father at tiny Loogootee. “People couldn’t wait to get the paper and track the brackets and you’d come up with your own final four. Teams were ranked one through 20 back then, so you had an indication of who the top 20 teams in the state were, though it didn't always work out that way.""

Plump, whose winning shot in the 1954 state championship game for little Milan High became the inspiration for “Hoosiers,” said he didn’t know a thing about the NCAA Tournament back in those days.

“High school basketball was the epitome of everything around here. Coming from the little town of Pierceville and going to Milan, we didn’t even get news from Indianapolis,” he said. “Heck, if we had known how good those teams were, we might not have won.”

But they did. And Plump and Butcher became early poster children for bracket-busting in Indiana.

Plump's shot for Milan is one of the most famous in basketball history. And it is only part of the lore in Indiana. The next year, Oscar Robertson led Indianapolis Crispus Attucks to the state title — a first an all-Black team in the U.S. The names and schools are steeped in history: John Wooden of Martinsville, Larry Bird of Springs Valley, George McGinnis of Indianapolis Washington, Glenn Robinson of Gary Roosevelt, Rick Mount of Lebanon.

Story continues

If Butcher had won the 1974-75 title, instead of finishing second, his name might be on that list, too.

After turning down on offer to play for Red Auerbach’s Boston Celtics in 1957, Butcher’s father, Jack, returned to his little hometown and became the winningest prep coach in state history. Twice he led teams to what the state finals; the 1975 team was unbeaten and his son was leading the way.

The Lions beat Columbus North 50-27 in a semifinal earlier in the day only to struggle that night against powerhouse Marion in the title game. While Butcher led Loogootee with 14 points in his final game, he didn’t shoot well and Marion won, 58-46.

Now 64, Butcher can still rattle off the wins from that season like they just happened, even if the final moment was a loss. He still carved out a niche in Indiana lore that rivals Plump’s last shot. At the end of the Loogootee’s semi-state championship victory over Seymour, an assistant coach suggested it was time for Butcher to deliver on a promise to honor his father.

“He told me ‘If you’re ever going pass the ball to your dad, you better do it now,’” Butcher said. “So I got up, ran over to the scorer’s table and checked in. I was dribbling around, hamming it up and then I went right over to the bench, did a reverse pivot and threw it right to him. He caught it. The ref looked at my dad and my dad looked at the ref and the ref didn’t know what to do right away. Finally, he blew the whistle.”

The memories from those days never fade away and stretch beyond the state lines.

“It’s so cool to do a state tournament where you combine all the classifications,” said Gonzaga coach Mark Few, whose team hoped to become the first unbeaten NCAA champion in 45 years. “I know in Washington sometimes, the best teams aren’t always from the biggest classification, they’re from a classification down or two.”

Indiana's single-class format died in 1998 when, after 87 years, the IHSAA switched to a four-class system over the objections of Plump, Butcher and many others. Initially, the governing body attempted to calm the furor with a “tournament of champions” featuring the four class winners. Two years later, it was scrapped.

Gone were the days of cramming of 41,046 fans into a state title game as Damon Bailey's Bedford North Lawrence championship team did in 1990. Gone were the downtown parade so many Indiana prep players grew up dreaming about.

On Saturday, the eight state finalists won't even have center stage to themselves.

A year after the Indiana tourney was canceled because of COVID-19 and a week later than usual because of the NCAA's revised tournament schedule, the four state championship games will be played at Bankers Life Fieldhouse — just a few blocks away from Lucas Oil Stadium and the Final Four. It's just not the same.

“The Indiana high school tournament is still special, not as special as it used to be, but it’s still special,"" said Plump, now 84.

Still, the tourney tales are part of the legacy handed down through generations and it's been that way almost from the moment the first organized game was played in Crawfordsville in March 1894 between two YMCA teams.

Here, hardwood heroes became the stuff of legend. Here, bracket pools were popularized. And here, while Plump and Butcher became role models for all the little schools that never made it, the single-tourney class lessons remain as vivid today as they were when the stars were playing.

“That year (1975) was the last time gave out silver rings to the state runner-ups and when I think about what I do now, I can look at the at that ring now and say, ‘I overcame things and odds people never thought we could,'"" Butcher said., “When I look at this ring now, I say, ‘I can do this.' It’s helped make me who I am.""

Jewelry Designer Alex Woo Dead at 47,"A private memorial was held April 2, on Siesta Beach in Sarasota, Fla., for jewelry designer Alex Woo, 47, who died of cancer at her home in New York City on March 30.

Woo was an award-winning designer who had been in business for over 20 years and is best known for her sculptural charms that blend craftsmanship with personal storytelling. She is credited with being the first jewelry designer to specialize in personalization with her Little Icons Collections. She designed the yellow gold “C” necklace worn by Carrie Bradshaw in “The Carrie Diaries,” and her jewelry was worn by most of the characters in “Gossip Girl,” including Blair Waldorf’s signature “BW” necklace. Woo also produced all the jewelry for Major League Baseball, was named one of Crain’s New York Business’ 40 under 40 and counts many fashion editors, influencers and celebrities as among her customers, according to her web page. Her collections are sold at department and fine jewelry stores throughout the U.S.

More from WWD

Woo’s husband, Ed Huang, sent out the news of her passing on April 2 to employees and business partners, saying: “She passed away peacefully earlier this week surrounded by the love of her family and friends. Alexandra was a doting mother, wife, daughter, and businesswoman, and her impact on the jewelry industry will never be forgotten. Over an illustrious 20 years, she told countless stories through her designs, and they quickly became an extension of who she was. Always smiling and in good spirits, she enjoyed being able to share and take part in women’s lives and loved strengthening special moments and experiences through her jewelry.

“Thank you for the outpouring of love and support during this time,” Huang continued. “Although we are filled with grief, there is comfort in knowing her extraordinary legacy and story will continue to be written through her designs. We greatly appreciate your patience as we adjust to a new reality. Alex was talented, vibrant, and remarkable in so many ways and will be deeply missed. May she rest in peace, a true jewelry Icon.”

Her close friend, Lynette Harrison Brubaker, founder and chief executive officer of LHB Group, added in a Facebook post: “Alex was whip smart, a ferocious entrepreneur, a brilliantly talented designer and a generous mentor to many — especially to me when I launched my own company. She was also very funny — we were often co-conspirators at fashion industry events, giggling perhaps a bit too loudly but we just felt damn fortunate to be doing work that was fulfilling and fun. But, we never laughed harder than when we were comparing notes on raising our young sons. Here we were, two very girly, girls becoming experts in the most obscure Star Wars and Clone Wars characters! Oh Alex, how I will miss you but I will honor you each day by laughing with abandon and by being a willing mentor and cheerleader for others because that’s what you’d do.”

In addition to her husband, Woo is survived by her son, Alexander, and their family dog, Teddy.

Vulnerable Dems fret after getting a shock: AOC’s campaign cash,"As the midterm campaign’s first fundraising deadline approached this week, several vulnerable House Democrats got an unwelcome surprise in their accounts: $5,000 from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The New York Democrat sent the contributions to her colleagues to help keep the House majority ahead of a tough cycle without directly contributing to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, with which she’s publicly clashed. But Ocasio-Cortez's largesse — and an oversight at the campaign headquarters — has instead raised awkward questions among her colleagues as some swing-district Democrats fret over whether to return her money before the GOP can turn it into an attack ad.

Some members whose campaigns got unexpected Ocasio-Cortez cash are seeking answers directly from DCCC Chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) and his top staffers. DCCC aides gave lawmakers’ wire transfer information to Ocasio-Cortez's aides without the approval of more senior officials, according to multiple people familiar with the contributions.

Even if imperiled House Democrats refund her contribution now, Ocasio-Cortez’s name is almost certain to show up on their Federal Election Commission reports when they’re due this month — creating a liability for members of her party who have to win reelection in districts where her political brand is poisoned thanks to years of unrelenting Republican attacks.

While some are grateful for the infusion of cash, at least three Democrats have so far either declined the initial transfer or said they would return the money: Reps. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Carolyn Bourdeaux of Georgia and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, according to multiple sources.

Several people involved with the episode described it as an unforced error by the DCCC, with the staff of its campaign arm failing to anticipate the political ramifications of putting their party’s most polarizing figure on their donor rolls of vulnerable members known as frontliners.

Story continues

Chris Hayden, a spokesman for DCCC declined to comment on the details but said: “We appreciate Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's ongoing commitment to a Democratic majority. Due to a miscommunication, some transfers were made in error, but that has been addressed.”

Normally, swing-district Democrats are scrounging for every last dollar to help them secure their reelections, particularly in a first quarter that has been tougher than usual for candidates across the board. But the Ocasio-Cortez donation, these Democrats said, was unsolicited and came without warning. Many of their campaigns did not receive a heads-up from the DCCC about the donation until after it hit members’ accounts — a move that surprised senior aides and campaign consultants.

“The GOP has spent four years saying the frontliners are all socialists. Now they’ve got the receipts to prove it. Anyone telling themselves this won’t be in campaign ads is in denial,” said one Democratic consultant who works for swing-seat members.

In the political donation world, wire transfers are commonly used to quickly move large sums of money from one account to another, particularly in the final stretch of a fundraising quarter and during a pandemic. The Ocasio-Cortez transfers carried clear political risk for some members, however, and some sources pointed out that she could have alleviated the current anxiety by giving to the DCCC directly.

Still, other Democrats said they saw Ocasio-Cortez’s interest in helping endangered incumbents as a positive sign for party unity, even if they were stunned by the method. And privately, the liberal star already is personally close with some of the frontliners, many of whom were elected in the same blue wave that helped Democrats recapture the House in 2018.

She offered to make similar donations to frontline Democrats during the 2020 election cycle but only contributed to those who took her up on the offer, according to two sources familiar with her political operation.

The sophomore New York Democrat spent years at loggerheads with the campaign arm and is among several progressives who have refused to pay member dues to DCCC, in part because of its treatment of liberal primary challengers.

Her current round of donations alone — an intended total of $160,000 — amount to more than half of Ocasio-Cortez’s entire dues goal for the 2020 cycle, according to a dues report obtained by POLITICO.

Ocasio-Cortez is a prolific fundraiser with a campaign machine of her own that could be a major asset to Democrats as they attempt to hold onto their majority next fall. While she has given to some individual frontline Democrats in the past, such as Reps. Mike Levin and Katie Porter of California as well as Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, her past giving has been more selective.

This year’s crop of DCCC frontliners include 32 hand-picked Democrats who face some of the toughest elections in the country next November. The majority of them flipped GOP seats in 2018. Some, like Levin and Porter of California, proudly identify with the left wing of the party, and would face minimal political risk from an affiliation from the progressive icon.

But Ocasio-Cortez's money poses a problem for Democrats such as Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Slotkin, who represent more moderate turf and have sought to distance themselves from the left wing of the caucus. Many of the Democratic frontliners are particularly anxious this cycle after their party’s down-ballot disaster last November, which wiped out 13 incumbents. Even Democrats who clung onto their seats saw victory margins much closer than expected and remain shocked by inaccurate polling.

Now Republican campaigns have obvious fodder for attacks on many of those Democrats as “funded by” or “taking money from” Ocasio-Cortez. Past GOP attempts to elevate Ocasio-Cortez and other younger Democrats of color into bogeywomen haven't paid huge dividends with independent voters, but their effectiveness in motivating the Republican base means they're likely to continue — particularly as President Joe Biden looks to incorporate some of her priorities into his agenda.

Still, several Democratic operatives said they are expecting GOP candidates to run attacks yoking their members to Ocasio-Cortez and democratic socialist policies whether or not her contributions get returned.

“If the Republicans are going to hit us on AOC, they’re going to do it anyways,” said one Democratic source close to the process. “They don't care about the truth.”

Record-high temperatures for March were broken across parts of Europe on the final day of the month, but a storm eyeing the region will bring more winterlike conditions and below-normal temperatures to these same areas. By Easter Sunday, a drastic change in the weather pattern will begin. A storm near Scandinavia will drag a cold front across the United Kingdom and Ireland through Sunday night. Anyone headed to church in celebration of Easter across Scotland, Northern Ireland and far northern England should prepare for showers as well as cooler weather. The cold front will continue advancing across France and Germany on Monday. The front will usher in areas of showers as well as drastically cooler conditions compared to the end of March. On Monday, temperatures in the 40s F (4-9 C) are expected across much of the United Kingdom, northern France and northern Germany. In the Scottish Highlands, temperatures will struggle to climb out of the 30s F (0-4 C). CLICK HERE FOR THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP Similar temperatures are expected to occur in southern France and Germany into the middle of the week. As temperatures drop and the front advances, rain can mix with and even change over to snow or sleet at times across much of Europe. By Tuesday, the wintry mix is forecast to spread into the Balkan Peninsula as showers taper off in the United Kingdom and into France. Outside of a slushy coating in some colder spots, little to no accumulation of snow is expected across most of the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Poland, especially after the mild conditions last week. However, in the higher elevations across Europe, including the Scottish Highlands, the Alps and Carpathian Mountains, precipitation is forecast to fall as mainly snow and can lead to accumulations. ""One to three inches (3-8 cm) of snow will accumulate across the Alps, the Dinaric Alps, the Apennines, the Carpathian Mountains and into central Ukraine,"" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Tony Zartman. ""Six to twelve inches (15-30 cm) of snow will accumulate the higher elevations of the Alps, the Dinaric Alps and the Carpathian Mountains,"" said Zartman, adding that these are the most likely locations for the AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 30 inches (75 cm) to occur. This amount of snow can lead to slippery roads and sidewalks at lower elevations and dangerous travel conditions at higher mountain passes. In addition to blustery, wintry showers, the storm near Scandinavia can bring wind gusts of 50-60 mph (80-100 km/h) with an AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 70 mph (115 km/h) that can cause rough seas, localized damage and power outages. Chilly weather can persist into the second half of the week as the next storm system can bring a reinforcing blast of cold as well as another round of showers. This winter reminder will come following a tase of summer and record-breaking temperatures across much Europe. People enjoy the sunny weather along the Canal Saint-Martin despite the coronavirus pandemic in Paris, France, on March 31, 2021. Critical care doctors in Paris say surging coronavirus infections could soon overwhelm their ability to care for the sick in the French capital's hospitals, possibly forcing them to choose which patients they have the resources to save. President Macron is expected to give a TV speech on Wednesday detailing possible new restrictions to fight COVID-19. Photo by Aurore Marechal/ABACAPRESS.COM One of the cities that set a new record was Paris. The afternoon temperature reached 78 F (25.6 C) in the French capital on Wednesday. This set a new record-high temperature for the month of March in the City of Lights. Highs in the 70s F (21-26 C) were common from Spain and France to Germany and western Poland. Even parts of central England topped that same threshold. Normal high temperatures during the end of March range from the middle 50s F (around 13 C) in France and Germany to around 60 F (16 C) in Spain.

"Madonna Shares Sexy Topless Selfies as She Asks, 'Why Do I Always Have to Explain Everything?'","Madonna/Instagram

Madonna isn't answering to anyone but herself.

The 62-year-old pop icon posted a series of selfies to her Instagram grid on Friday, which showed her wearing a collection of several necklaces — and seemingly not much else.

In the topless images, Madonna gazes at the camera with a serious expression on her face as her long blonde hair hangs down the front of her body, concealing her breasts.

""Why do I have to Explain Everything ... 🐰,"" she wrote in the caption.

RELATED: Madonna, 58, Shows Off Her Nude (and Fit!) Body on Instagram

While Madonna didn't elaborate on the nature of her caption, she has been in the news as of late regarding her presence on social media.

Last month, a woman named Amelia Goldie alleged that the ""Vogue"" signer had photoshopped her face onto Goldie's body in a photo she posted six years ago, while promoting her album Rebel Heart.

In a video posted to her TikTok on March 10, Goldie shared a side-by-side image from a magazine that showed Madonna in an identical outfit and pose to hers, including a Joy Division T-shirt, houndstooth-pattern skirt and black platform heels.

""I [would] definitely laugh and say I'm flattered, but of course that I wish I was credited!"" Goldie told Buzzfeed of how she'd respond if Madonna, whom she is a big fan of, ever reached out to her.

""I think if you're going to play somebody else's body off as your own, they deserve to be mentioned. But no hard feelings!"" she added. (A rep for Madonna has not responded to PEOPLE's request for comment, and the singer has not publicly addressed the allegations.)

On Thursday, the ""Like a Virgin"" hitmaker posted a series of sultry videos in which she seemed to be making her relationship with backup dancer/rumored boyfriend Ahlamalik Williams Instagram official.

In the videos, Madonna was wearing a purple hooded windbreaker over her long blonde locks, licking her lips seductively for what appeared to be a photo shoot with Williams, 26, as smoke billowed around the pair.

The two shared several steamy kisses throughout the footage, set to a background track of ""Vanity"" by Aftertheparty. At one point, Madonna even blew smoke into Williams' mouth.

She also posted a shared of snapshots from the shoot, giving a closer look at her ensemble including large hoop earrings, a variety of necklaces, a wide-rimmed black hat, a low-cut black top — and, in one photo, a marijuana cigarette between her teeth.

While a rep for Madonna has not commented on the nature of her relationship with Williams, the two were spotted with his hands around her waist on her hotel balcony in Miami in December 2019. He'd been a fixture on her Instagram account since earlier that year, making appearances throughout the summer and fall, and has since popped up occasionally, including during her 62nd birthday trip to Jamaica in August.",

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life.

If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss?

St. Paul gangster's kidnapping trial came to dramatic end,"The defendant stood with his arms behind his back, so the federal judge in St. Paul couldn't see his left hand. But courtroom witnesses caught a glimpse of a small white object between Jack Peifer's fingers on July 31, 1936, at the end of his kidnapping conspiracy trial.

""I thought at first the pill might have been an aspirin tablet,"" said Herbert Wenzel, an office worker with the Works Progress Administration who was attending the trial with his assistant.

Peifer, 43, had been found guilty and sentenced to 30 years for hatching the plot to kidnap brewing heir William Hamm Jr. for a $100,000 ransom — keeping $10,000 for himself. Just as District Court Judge M.M. Joyce denied his motion for a new trial and lectured him about his wrongdoing and its effect on his family, Peifer pulled a handkerchief from his back pocket, covered his mouth and swallowed a capsule of potassium cyanide.

He died two hours later in a Ramsey County jail cell. It was the beginning of the end of St. Paul's storied gangster era.

The son of a Litchfield, Minn., tavern owner, John Peter Peifer had followed in his father's footsteps — and then some — as Prohibition ended, the Depression dragged on and gangsters and crooked cops ruled St. Paul in the early 1930s. Described as a fixer and gambler, Peifer owned the Hollyhocks Club on a bluff overlooking the river from Mississippi River Boulevard in St. Paul.

""There the well-heeled from all over the Midwest came to enjoy thick, juicy steaks and decent wines before heading upstairs for craps, blackjack, and roulette,"" writes Carolyn Cox in her new book, ""The Snatch Racket: The Kidnapping Epidemic that Terrorized 1930s America.""

Of all the mobster-friendly towns in the early 1930s, from Atlantic City to Reno, ""The most notorious of all was St. Paul, Minnesota,"" according to Cox. ""Hands down.""

Under the unwritten rules of the day, criminals were welcome in St. Paul as long as they checked in with police when they arrived in town, paid the cops bribes and avoided violent crime within city limits. Peifer skimmed 20% of his Hollyhocks profits and delivered them to police and city leaders in a bag each week so his underworld customers needn't worry.

Story continues

In April 1933, Peifer met with gang leaders Alvin ""Creepy"" Karpis and Fred Barker at Hollyhocks and floated his scheme to kidnap Hamm, 39, president of the Theodore Hamm Brewing Co. and widely considered the Midwest's most eligible bachelor. Peifer arranged for a cottage on Bald Eagle Lake near White Bear Lake where the conspirators planned the crime, often going into St. Paul to spy on Hamm's daily routine and map their escape.

""We got to know so much about [Hamm] that I was sick of him long before the kidnapping,"" Karpis later wrote in his memoir, after being paroled from a life sentence at Alcatraz prison for his role in the kidnapping.

The gang snatched Hamm on June 15, 1933, while he walked to his mother's Dayton's Bluff house for lunch. They hid him near Chicago until his wealthy beer family forked over the $100,000 — worth nearly $2 million in today's dollars. Within four days, they dropped Hamm off in Wyoming, Minn.

""It was a smooth, professional, by-the-book snatch, well planned and executed,"" writes Cox, a retired Washington, D.C., lawyer who scoured the FBI's kidnap files from 1932 to 1937. She found it odd that Peifer decided to kidnap Hamm in St. Paul when he was supposed to enforce the system that protected criminals in the city in exchange for them avoiding shenanigans there.

The FBI at first wrongly pinned the Hamm kidnapping on a Chicago gang, which was acquitted. Agents found Karpis' fingerprints on ransom notes, but it took three years — and the kidnapping of St. Paul banker Edward Bremer — before Karpis was busted in New Orleans. In the meantime, Barker and his mother had died in 1935 in a shootout with police in Florida.

Peifer insisted he was innocent, calling the case against him ""the biggest frame-up I have ever heard about."" Some websites question whether he killed himself to avoid doing time, or if he was snuffed out because he knew too much.

""Peifer was yellow and if he had been held long enough he would have talked,"" Karpis told the FBI, fingering Peifer with the kidnapping. What Karpis said, according to U.S. Attorney George Sullivan, ""left no doubt that there are several men in St. Paul who are mighty glad Peifer died.""

Peifer had married 31-year-old Violet Nordquist in South Dakota the year before. When a reporter told her he was dead, she hailed a taxi, went to the jail and then the morgue. As she stroked his hair there, she said: ""Jack, dear, this is what you get for being so good to people.""

At Peifer's flower-filled funeral a few days later, the Minneapolis Tribune reported, Violet ""with visible effort, kept control of her emotions, though she appeared fatigued after a two-day vigil beside the silver metallic casket where her husband lay.""

Stockton police accused of beating Black teen,"The New York Times

NEW YORK — The Rev. Henry Torres told his parishioners, who had gathered on Palm Sunday in socially distanced rows of half-empty pews, that God had not abandoned them. The virus had killed dozens of regulars at the church, St. Sebastian Roman Catholic Church in Queens, and the pandemic forced it to close its doors for months last year. But the parishioners were there now, he said, which was a sign of hope. “Even through difficulties, God is at work,” Torres said. “Even when people are suffering, even if it may seem that God is silent, that does not mean that God is absent.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times That is a message that many Christians — and the cash-strapped churches that minister to them — are eager to believe this Easter, as the springtime celebration of hope and renewal on Sunday coincides with rising vaccination rates and the promise of a return to something resembling normal life. Religious services during the Holy Week holidays, which began on Palm Sunday and end on Easter, are among the most well-attended of the year, and this year they offer churches a chance to begin rebuilding their flocks and regaining their financial health. But the question of whether people will return is a crucial one. Across the city, many churches have still not reopened despite state rules that would allow them to do so. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, a nationally prominent Black church, said concerns over the coronavirus, and its disproportionate impact on the Black community, would keep his church from reopening until at least the fall. Nicholas Richardson, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, said many of its churches had also not reopened. When the diocese introduced a program last fall to allow its 190 parishes to pay a reduced tithe to the diocese, roughly half of them applied. “It varies church by church,” he said. “Pledges are not necessarily dramatically down, but donations given to the collection plate are hopelessly down.” The Rev. Patrick J. West, the pastor at St. Sebastian, said he and other priests have fretted over the return of parishioners when they gather for meals. Parishioners still fear the virus, which has killed tens of thousands of New Yorkers, and many have become accustomed to watching Mass online from the comforts of home, he said. “The word I use is ‘repatriate,’” he said. “How are we going to repatriate people back to the church? I don’t think it’s a matter of people’s faith, it’s a matter of health and safety. They need to be convinced that it is safe to worship in a congregation again, and I think that is absolutely right.” The hardships of the pandemic have been keenly felt at St. Sebastian, a bustling parish that offers Mass in English, Spanish and Tagalog inside a soaring, windowless space that was once a Loews movie theater. It sits on a busy intersection in the shadow of elevated subway tracks in Woodside, a working class but quickly gentrifying part of Queens where roughly 10% of the residents have been infected by the coronavirus, according to city data. “A lot of people have died,” said Micky Torres, a Filipino immigrant and longtime parishioner. A close friend of his from the parish died of COVID-19 in the first weeks of the pandemic, he said. It was his first of several Zoom funerals. “It was very sad and very weird.” At least 50 active parishioners at St. Sebastian have died of COVID-19, many in the early days of the pandemic when holding a funeral was impossible because the church was closed, said West. He began his assignment in the parish, which was founded in 1894 and moved into the former theater in 1954, shortly after churches were allowed to reopen at the end of June. The death rate in Woodside is higher than in the city as a whole, according to city data. “When I first got here it was memorial Mass after memorial Mass after memorial Mass,” he said. “We were having seven a week, plus funeral Masses for the people who were dying at that same time. We are still doing memorial Masses a year later.” St. Sebastian would normally welcome as many as 5,000 worshippers before the pandemic across several Masses on Saturdays and Sundays, said West. But pandemic rules limit its capacity to 50% and require social distancing. A good weekend now would draw roughly 1,200 people, less than a quarter of the pre-pandemic crowd, the pastor said. He said he hoped attendance at Easter would be robust, but there was no way to know for sure. The parish has adjusted in other ways, too. Masks and social distancing are required; hand sanitizer is readily available. Parishioners have also replaced the sign of peace, traditionally a handshake, with a nod or a wave. Churches were closed for 15 weeks during the first months of the pandemic last year, which included Holy Week. Even after they reopened at 25% capacity, many parishioners stayed away. That deprived parishes of both the people whose physical presence wills the community into existence, and the donations they make each week that help pay the bills. The resulting turmoil has wreaked havoc on the finances of churches across the New York region and the country, including icons like St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan and more humble houses of worship like St. Sebastian. All depend heavily on weekly donations to pay their expenses, which include utilities, staff salaries and an 8% tax paid to the local diocese. “We are hurting,” said West, who estimated the parish’s income had gone down 35% during the pandemic. The shortfall had forced him to keep the parish center closed, to lay off staff members in the parish office and even to ask the Diocese of Brooklyn to transfer one priest away from St. Sebastian. “We have a large immigrant population, and people are not used to using electronic payments or even writing checks,” said West. “If they are not physically here to donate cash, then we don’t physically get the donation.” Many Christians attend in-person services only on Christmas and Easter. Donations given on those two holidays make up 10% of the annual collection for most Catholic parishes, said Matthew Manion, the director for the Center for Church Management at Villanova University. He researched church finances during the pandemic and found steep income declines in parishes of all sizes. Based on figures from last year, he projects a 20% to 25% decline in the 2021 fiscal year, which may be exacerbated if people keep watching Mass online instead of in person. “The big questions are, Will Catholics who practice their faith frequently come back? And Catholics who practice their faith less frequently, are they gone for good?” said Manion. “Both of those answers could have big impacts, spiritually and financially.” He added: “Easter will be an interesting experiment. The spring will tell us a lot about what fiscal year 2022 and beyond will look like.” The mood was wary but hopeful at St. Sebastian on Palm Sunday, where street vendors sold woven palm fronds outside in the rain and a group of parishioners stood in the church foyer to listen to Mass, despite the audible rush and rattle of the elevated subway passing outside. Fewer than half the seats were filled at the morning’s English Mass, but a Spanish service later in the day was so well attended that worshippers were sent to the auditorium of the parish school so they could watch it on livestream while still obeying social distancing rules. Manuel Gil, a Peruvian immigrant who has worshipped at St. Sebastian for 25 years, said he thought the aftermath of the pandemic might actually bring more people to church, not fewer. “The important thing is that people have faith,” he said. “I think more people will come after the pandemic, because people whose families or friends have passed away will be looking for God. People’s lives have changed.” Speaking from the pulpit, Henry Torres urged parishioners to see the empty pews all around them as not just a manifestation of pandemic-era rules, but as vacant seats that might have been filled by those who died in the last year. But they should not dwell in sadness, he told the flock. Instead, they should celebrate the fact that they have survived. “You and I have been privileged and given an opportunity,” he said. “An hour from now is not promised. Tomorrow is not promised. All we have is right here and right now. Let us work right here and right now on our intimacy with God.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",
"Person County deputy shoots to death a man holding hostages, sheriff says","The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations is reviewing a fatal deputy-involved shooting that occurred Friday night, the Person County Sheriff’s Office said Saturday.

Sheriff Dewey Jones said a deputy was dispatched around 10:13 p.m. Friday in response to an incomplete 911 call from a location in the 1300 block of Clay Long Road in Hurdle Mills, N.C.. When the deputy arrived, they found a man with a gun holding three people hostage, Jones said.

The deputy called for assistance and demanded that the man drop his weapon, Jones said. The man refused and pointed the gun at the hostages, and the deputy fired at him and hit him at least one time, according to the sheriff. When asked how many shots the deputy fired, Jones said he believed the total to have been three shots, but said the SBI would confirm the exact number.

The News & Observer reached out to the SBI for more information, but did receive a response Saturday afternoon.

Jones said the deputy called emergency medical services and administered aid to the man, but that shortly after EMS arrived on scene, the suspect was pronounced dead.

Jones said one of the hostages had previously obtained a domestic violence protection order against the man the deputy shot.

He said he had been told that one of the victims had been assaulted by the suspect, but said that portion of the investigation was being handled by the SBI.

Jones said he was unable to provide any further details about the suspect, again deferring to the SBI.

The deputy has been placed on administrative leave while the SBI conducts its investigation, which Jones said is standard procedure.",
CURBING VIOLENCE: Another mass shooting brings question of gun control to the forefront again,"Apr. 3—When firearms are left in the hands of those who mean to do harm, lives can change in the blink of an eye, as evidenced by the recent mass shootings in Atlanta, Georgia; Boulder, Colorado; and even Muskogee, Oklahoma.

The recent spate of shootings across the country has again increased demands for stricter gun control measures. Although the U.S. House of Representatives passed two measures recently that would expand requirements for background checks, they're unlikely to pass the Senate. However, it appears many Oklahomans don't believe increased restrictions are the answer, anyway.

In Oklahoma, state law generally prevents knowingly transferring a firearm to convicted felons; people have have been adjudicated delinquent; those who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs; or people under adjudication of mental incompetency or have otherwise been found mentally unfit by a court.

Compared to other states, Oklahoma has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country, and many of its residents are armed.

Law enforcement officers don't seem to have an issue with their constituents carrying, either. Both Cherokee County Sheriff Jason Chennault and Tahlequah Police Department Chief Nate King believe legally-armed citizens are an asset in reducing violent crimes. So laws to further restrict gun ownership won't make their lives easier, they said.

""Increased restriction on gun ownerships will absolutely not help law enforcement, and people who think they will are being extremely naive,"" said Chennault. ""People who mean to do other harm with a gun don't care about restrictions; they don't care about gun laws. If they care about following gun laws, they would also care enough to not want to do harm to other people.""

Mass shootings are attributed to a variety of issues — whether it be educational issues, mental illnesses, racism, or political polarization. The causes of such incidents are typically confounded with opinions from political pundits and everyday citizens.

Story continues

Dee Page, owner of Recoil Arms in Tahlequah, favors measures that help take guns ""out of the bad guys' hands,"" but she doesn't think more gun control per se is the answer. She thinks the mental health system should be addressed first, because there are too many hoops for those with disabilities to jump through to get the help they need.

""There are issues that need to be addressed before firearms are allowed,"" she said. ""If they're a problem to themselves and others, then absolutely not. But there are some mental illnesses that are not that far out; they just need help.""

In Oklahoma, to purchase a gun from a licensed dealer, a background check is required. Prospective gun owners also must be 21 and show proof of residency. While background checks can prevent the wrong person from getting a firearm, they can't stop all transactions from occurring.

Page said people who know they're not allowed to have guns probably wouldn't try to go through a background check, anyway.

""I don't think background checks do a whole lot of good,"" she said. ""All it does is check to see if you're a felon or have certain misdemeanors. So if you're a felon, you don't get a background check to proceed with that purchase. They go out to the flea markets to pick up a gun, or they steal it.""

Mass shootings in schools are among the biggest concerns. While many people would prefer to see more school resources officers in place to protect students, state legislators are considering measures to allow teachers and school personnel to carry firearms on campus. Most teachers do not want to carry, and many oppose the move.

Nevertheless, it's a measure that's received support from State Sen. Dewayne Pemberton, R-Muskogee, a former educator. He said the best way to protect people is to allow them to protect themselves. He added that laws such as that would be more effective than those restricting gun ownership.

""Felons don't follow the laws,"" he said. ""Whatever laws you put on the book, they're going to be broken. There's no way to write enough laws to change things that are going to happen, like mass shootings.""

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome.

At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch.

Ethiopia says Eritrean troops are pulling out of Tigray,"The New York Times

NEW YORK — For New York City’s economy, the last 12 months have amounted to one long, brutal winter. The pandemic forced the shutdown of most of the city’s businesses, wiped out hundreds of thousands of jobs and kept away tens of millions of tourists. By many measures, the nation’s biggest city suffered the greatest losses and faces one of the longest and steepest climbs back. Shows will not return to Broadway stages until after Labor Day, and many workers will not begin commuting to the office and buying lunch at the corner deli for months, if they return at all. But for the first time since the city went on lockdown late last March, there are palpable signs of rebirth, fueled by a growing supply of COVID-19 vaccines and an impending gusher of federal aid to City Hall, the schools, the transit system, restaurants and theaters. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Shoots of the budding optimism pop up almost daily: The Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking Central Park called back workers for a reopening this week. Union Square Café, a popular Manhattan restaurant that had been closed for months, is feeding diners again. Fans were in the stands again when the New York Yankees opened their season in the Bronx on Thursday, though limited to one-fifth of the seats. The city’s outlook has improved as result of the latest stimulus bill, financial analysts say, which included about $6 billion in direct aid to the city government, $6.5 billion to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and $4 billion to the city’s public schools. “There’s a lot of cash that’s going to come in fairly quickly here,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It’s going to provide big pops to places that have been more or less shut down.” The federal aid will help solve some of the city’s biggest short-term problems, including huge drops in revenue from property and sales taxes and fares that the MTA, which runs the subway, buses and two commuter rails, is heavily dependent on. Still, the road to full recovery will be long and steep, business leaders and analysts say. Entire industries, including the arts, hotels and restaurants, were decimated, with thousands of businesses closing for good. Tourism, a pillar of the economy, is years away from rebounding, according to forecasts. And many companies are making at least some remote work a permanent feature, raising questions about the future of Manhattan without legions of office workers. “The city still has a ways to go,” said Ana Champeny, director of city studies for the Citizens Budget Commission. “You’ve got to get commuters back in Midtown and downtown, the business district. You’ve got to get restaurants and theaters reopened.” The infusion of federal aid has provided some reason for hope. The MTA has gone from threatening to sharply reduce service and lay off workers to promising to restore 24-hour subway service, which was suspended during the pandemic. Many restaurants that struggled to survive through a monthslong ban on indoor dining can try to recoup losses and the costs of adapting to pandemic restrictions. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader from New York, said the aid that will flow to New York state and its residents from the stimulus bill, known as the American Rescue Plan, amounted to nearly $100 billion. Mayor Bill de Blasio will lay out a plan for spending the direct aid when he presents his budget in April, said a spokeswoman, Laura Feyer. The mayor said the aid would enable the city “to finally overcome the massive revenue loss and to serve our people, keep our workforce strong, bring our city back.” The direct local aid “can put the city on solid fiscal footing,” said Champeny, though the city still faces large budget deficits in future years. “It is an incredibly generous package that will definitely start the rebuild.” The rebuild faces formidable challenges. The New York metropolitan area lost more than 1 million jobs in 2020, close to double the Los Angeles area’s loss and triple the Chicago area’s, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The city’s official unemployment rate rose to 12.9% in February, more than double the national rate, which was 6.2% in February and fell to 6% in March.) The job losses fell harder on those who were clinging to the lower rungs of the city’s economic ladder. Low-paying jobs that cannot be done from home accounted for most of the losses, and many may not come back for years, if ever, economists said. New York was especially vulnerable to the pandemic’s economic pummeling because of its heavy reliance on tourists and business travelers to fill hotel beds and seats in restaurants, theaters and stadiums. The number of foreign visitors to New York is not expected to reach its 2019 level before 2025, according to the city’s tourism promotion agency. New York’s office towers are still largely empty, and the exodus of office workers from Manhattan — many of whom are not expected to return until the last half of the year — has crippled merchants and significantly reduced the value of much of the city’s commercial real estate, which will translate into a big drop in sales and property tax revenue. The city’s Independent Budget Office projected that the city’s recovery would remain “fragile and tentative for many more months.” Though a snapback in hiring this year and next would replace about 400,000 of the jobs the city lost, the budget office said that by the end of 2024 New York would still not have as many jobs as it did before the pandemic started. More than 200 of the city’s 700 hotels remain closed, leaving thousands of workers still unemployed, said Vijay Dandapani, chief executive of the Hotel Association of New York City. “My industry fell off a cliff on March 22 last year,” he said. Many hotel operators have received no federal aid during the pandemic, and nearly half are in default on their mortgages, Dandapani said. More than 40 hotels have fallen behind on their property tax payments to the city, which could put them in “a downward spiral” that they cannot escape, he added. But even the beleaguered hotel business is seeing glimmers of recovery. The Mandarin Oriental rehired more than 100 members of the Hotel Trades Council union for its reopening on Thursday, the hotel’s manager, Susanne Hatje, said. The Mandarin is offering discounted rates starting at $716 per night, 20% below prepandemic prices. The nearby Park Hyatt also reopened on Thursday, and other hotels are expected to join the trend as tourists trickle back. During the week that ended March 20, the city’s hotels had an occupancy rate of 50.8%, the highest in more than a year, according to STR, an industry research firm. Tourism may start to pick up slightly by late summer if fans return to the stands at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens. And if delegates come back to Manhattan in September for the United Nations General Assembly, hotels may fill more rooms. The city’s tourism promotion agency, NYC & Co., has forecast that the number of visitors will climb to 38 million this year, up from about 23 million in 2020, but still down about 40% from a record high level in 2019. Despite the city’s precarious situation, E.J. McMahon, founder of the Empire Center, a conservative research group, said he was wary about the extraordinary amount of federal aid flowing to the region. The pandemic’s impact on New York’s economy appears to be much deeper and longer lasting than the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack two decades ago, he said. “There’s going to be a hangover from this, a significant hangover.” Still, McMahon questioned, “What it is that government can do to actually re-create the economy?” Many of the lost jobs, such as cleaning hotel rooms and serving food, did not require much skill or extensive training, he said. “There’s a lot of potential here for problems and abuse of the money.” But James A. Parrott, an economist at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School, argued that the city should use some of the federal aid to retrain workers who have lost their jobs. “Tens of thousands of jobs will permanently disappear, and the city needs to do more to preserve the businesses that are trying to hang on,” Parrott said. “The city has never had a challenge on this scale before.” The restaurant business is one important part of New York’s private-sector economy that will benefit directly from the stimulus bill. The bill included more than $28 billion for restaurants across the nation that have been among the businesses worst hit by the pandemic’s economic fallout. A sizable chunk of that aid will likely go to New York’s restaurants because they experienced some of the longest and most severe restrictions, said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group. A recent survey by the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, estimated that 5,000 restaurants in the city had shut down for good during the pandemic. “This will save countless restaurants and jobs,” Rigie said. “It’s horrible that restaurants had to wait a year for this funding, but better late than never.” While it may take some time, “the city is going to see a big revival,” Zandi said. “It’s going to come roaring back.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company",

France sees further rise in COVID-19 intensive care patients,"National Review

The recent claim by public-health officials such as Dr. Birx that much of COVID-19 could have been prevented by better government policies points to the fact that the public-health profession lacks a basic understanding of how incentives affect disease prevention and control. Indeed, watching many aspects of the response to COVID-19 has been something of a series of déjà-vu experiences for public-health economists. The recent war of words over some of the population’s lack of demand for vaccines during its rollout is illustrative of the issues. As opposed to focusing on incentives, the public-health community is obsessed with words and messaging. They questioned whether President Trump supported the vaccines that his own Operation Warp Speed enabled, which of course he clarified he did. Never mind that before the election, Joe Biden had raised doubts about the safety of vaccines approved by the Trump administration. However, in the end, incentives, not words, will drive the demand (or lack thereof) for a vaccine during its rollout. The demand for vaccines depends on whether the benefit from reduced infection risk outweighs the full cost of being inoculated, including the attendant side effects and time and transportation costs involved. Therefore, demand will fall during a vaccine rollout as the risk of infection falls, but the various costs of inoculation will remain the same. This falling demand is likely to be more evident in the case of COVID as early vaccine rationing covered high-risk, and therefore high-demand, individuals. You don’t need conspiracy theories or misinformation to explain why we may not reach the high vaccination rates the public-health community wants for herd immunity. The later stages of the COVID-vaccine rollout will involve (mainly younger) people weighing the small probability of (for most) a flu-like infection against the uncertainty about — and lack of evidence on — long-term side effects of a vaccine yet to be definitively approved by the FDA. Indeed, the flu-like side effects associated with taking the vaccine are not substantially different from the COVID-19 disease for many. In this connection, it’s worth noting that less than half of the adult population, primarily the high-risk demographic, take the opportunity to receive regular flu vaccines, and that’s with well-proven vaccines and an absence of side effects. Many of those planning not to take a COVID shot raise side-effects concerns. The recent American Rescue Plan Act was a missed opportunity to confront the impact of the rollout itself on lowering future demand. It only allocated a few percentage points of the funding to the rollout, which is currently by far the most important issue for the economy. The public-health community’s ignorance of the role that incentives can play in establishing an appropriate response to a disease predates COVID. Indeed, in response to this shortcoming, the field of economic epidemiology emerged decades ago to address how incentives drive disease occurrence and what those incentives imply for the effects and value of government intervention. The experiences with COVID mirror many major past lessons of this field. The first is that the course of an epidemic disease is often driven by incentives in the private sector rather than by government policy. This is obvious for noncommunicable diseases, such as, say, obesity, but is also the case for communicable ones — despite what the policy debates across the world would suggest. The second is that government prevention — e.g., regulations and subsidies for preventive behavior — often have limited impact. With COVID, vastly different policies have led to largely similar outcomes. Indeed, states with the greatest public intervention have suffered the largest COVID losses on a per-capita basis. The old-school, or, to use Biden’s term, “Neanderthal,” rationale for these public policies when it comes to communicable diseases is based on externalities. In other words, preventing one person’s communicable disease confers benefits to others (by reducing the disease’s spread), which, therefore, justifies government intervention. However, to better understand the impact of government policies on the course of a disease, it’s necessary to look at how they interact with private initiatives. In the short run, steps taken by the state may have much less of an effect than often thought. Individuals typically react more rapidly than governments do. Governments can lock you down, but so can you, and more quickly — and that matters. President Reagan’s late response to HIV — or President Obama’s to H1N1 — are extreme illustrations of government lagging behind the private sector, but the same was true for early COVID mandates. For example, restaurant attendance was already down on average by about 85 percent in early 2020 by the time some states banned it. Recent research at the University of Chicago confirms this overall pattern. This lack of policy impact is often true in the long run, too. Because more disease incentivizes individuals to protect themselves more, we see disease cycles such as that for COVID. Prevention falls off as the risk of infection subsides, and a rise in cases then follows. New outbreaks prompt people to take more care, and cases fall again. But this implies that if government policy drives down cases temporarily, as, say, was the case with the March 2020 federal guidance, private prevention measures slip, leading to the disease’s reemergence as we have seen with the multiple COVID waves in the U.S. The impact of public prevention has less of an effect than might be hoped because of the way that it “crowds out” private prevention. The third lesson that COVID illustrates is that the incentives that encourage a focus on prevention against the disease often mean that the losses arising from prevention greatly exceed the losses due to reduced health from the disease. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, economists quantified the total loss, both from the disease directly and from the preventive measures taken to combat it. They found that about 80 percent of the total loss stemmed from prevention, because of the consequent forgone economic activity. Policy needs therefore to be focused on the total loss; the economic science on this suggests that the U.S. actually did better than countries that were often held up as role models at the time. The fourth lesson stems from the third and ultimately drove Operation Warp Speed. It is that medical innovation is often the cheapest form of prevention and therefore the key to lowering the total loss dominated by prevention-measure-induced loss. For example, the successful drugs for HIV or bariatric surgery for obesity are much cheaper forms of disease prevention than changing the demand for reproduction and food, hard-wired into us by evolution. Likewise, forgoing economic activity has put a high price on prevention of COVID across the globe, but this cost has now been reduced to the cost of vaccine production. Medical R&D spending in the tens of billions is again turning out to be a cheaper alternative to prevent disease than behavioral change costing trillions in economic losses across the world. Indeed, all the world’s proponents of socialized medicine, which includes most of the public-health community, are now lining up to get access to the vaccines that U.S. capitalism delivered. Though medical discoveries come from across the world, the more market-based pricing in the U.S. is responsible for about 70 percent of the global returns on the decades of past R&D investments that through cumulative innovation have led to the COVID vaccines. In summary, public-health experts, unlike economists, have no expertise in how incentives drive the course of a disease and the damage it causes, or how such incentives affect government intervention. Nor do they appear to have the expertise how to quantitatively evaluate the impact of such intervention on the total cost (disease plus prevention) of the disease. We have seen this lack of knowledge painfully play out during the COVID-19 pandemic during which the public-health profession has been pretty much reduced to counting cases and stressing prevention when infections rise. This falls far short of what we should be entitled to expect from experts. Next time around we can surely do better.",
Local experts react to Chauvin trial,"Apr. 3—Even before the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin began, Hermitage police Chief Eric Jewell realized that he had to do something to improve relationships between police and the community.

Toward that end, he assigned Officer Sam Staples as a full-time community outreach officer.

As the trial reached the end of its first week, Jewell said he wants to see the community — police and residents alike — come together and positively move forward.

""The Derek Chauvin incident just rocked the country and it set us back quite a ways,"" Jewell said. ""I want to build back what was lost and build back better. Through positive relationships between police and the community, we can achieve that.""

Friday marked the end of an emotional week of testimony and presentation of video evidence in the trial of Chauvin, accused of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd.

During testimony, witnesses said and video showed Chauvin drove his knee into Floyd's neck and pinned the Black man to the ground for more than 9 minutes. The incident sparked widespread protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality.

Video presented in the testimony appeared to show a frightened Floyd during the confrontation.

When asked about the role de-escalation plays in a situation such as the incident in which Chauvin killed Floyd, Jewell said policies and protocols are tailored differently in every organization.

He said police officers are trained to look for medical issues stemming from positional asphyxia, which may occur as a result of a technique known as ""prone restraint"" — used by police, corrections, military or health care staff — where a person is restrained face down, as Floyd was.

""We're cognizant of the fact that you don't want to be on somebody's body any longer than you have to,"" Jewell said. ""And you want to move somebody's body to a rescue position.""

Story continues

Mercer County Sheriff Bruce Rosa said in more than 40 years in law enforcement, including a stint as Sharpsville's police chief, he was taught to de-escalate situations when there is no longer a need to use force.

""At the point when someone is not resisting, then you de-escalate,"" Rosa said. ""Just because somebody is cuffed, doesn't mean they can't harm themselves or someone else.""

Jewell and Rosa said they have their guard up against anything happening after the conclusion of the trial, whether Chauvin is acquitted or convicted.

""We're going to be prepared either way,"" Rosa said. ""I'm not anticipating anything at this point, but I'm prepared if it does. Any time you get up and put on a badge, you prepare for that.""

While Jewell and Rosa represent policing's past and recent present, criminal justice professors training future law enforcement officers had their own opinions of the trial.

Allan M. Hunchuk, Ph.D., department chair and professor of Thiel College's department of Sociology and Criminal Justice Studies, said witness testimony has been fascinating.

""A lot of them are in distress,"" Hunchuck said of the witnesses.

Hunchuk said he thinks the defense is trying to build its case through its questioning of prosecution witnesses. But he believes it is going to be hard for the defense to rebut the compelling video images.

""It really looks like the guy is guilty,"" Hunchuk said. ""You have to go through the trial, though. You have to give him his day in court.""

Hunchak strongly believes that there is a need for social workers, trained in de-escalation techniques, to cooperate with police.

""A knee on the back of the neck for nine minutes just seems unconscionable,"" Hunchuk said.

If police could have waited and called a social worker to talk to Floyd, Hunchuk said the situation could have turned out differently.

""The Floyd case highlights things that are wrong with our system,"" Hunchuk said. ""More critical thinking skills would be helpful and the more training, the better.""

As an assistant professor of criminal justice at Penn State Shenango, Travis Milburn has been discussing the case with his students.

""I think thus far for me a lot of the testimony has really brought back all the feelings when the case initially happened last May,"" Milburn said. ""Some of the testimony and the emotionality, it's been heart-wrenching. It's been pretty raw. Difficult, at times, to watch.""

He is not so quick to give his opinion on Chavin's guilt or innocence and said that Chauvin may very well be acquitted.

""Conviction of police is more the exception than the rule,"" Milburn said. ""I'm cautious to think a conviction is certain, but I think the testimony at this point has played well for the prosecution.""

Milburn said more training for police, is not necessarily the answer to ending such events that led to Floyd's death.

""It's more complicated than updating the training manual or upping the de-escalation,"" Milburn said. ""I see these incidents will continue. Surface-level types of suggestions will likely not prevent these sorts of tragedies from happening.""

Policing in the U.S. is very different among states and even municipalities, Milburn said.

""As much as we can think about policing, it's a piecemeal project,"" Milburn said. ""Conviction in Minnesota does not equate to a change we see in Pa. or locally.""

Locally, Jewell and Rosa are reserving their opinions of Chauvin's guilt or innocence until the trial ends.

""A trial is about the totality of the evidence,"" Jewell said. ""I don't think it would be fair to the prosecution of the defense, or to make an assumption at this point.""

Rosa agrees.

""I want to see everything in its totality,"" Rosa said. ""If I'm going to do an investigation, I want to see everything.""

Jewell said he hopes jurors feel the same way, and listen to and consider all the facts.

""It's highly emotional. It's an emotionally-charged trial,"" Jewell said. ""A man died and it's sad that he died.""

"Lexington officers say two men cut catalytic converters at dealership, hid from police","Lexington police arrested two men Thursday in an attempted catalytic converters heist at a car dealership after finding one of the men in the woods and another under a vehicle in the middle of the night, according to reports.

The Lexington Police Department charged 23-year-old Tyler Lee Childers of Harleyville and 24-year-old John Otis Carn III of Saint George in the theft.

Childers was charged with breaking into a vehicle, attempted vehicle break-in, and unlawfully carrying a pistol. Carn was charged with two counts of breaking into a vehicle, possession of stolen metals and possession of tools used in a crime. Both were charged with criminal conspiracy and property damage.

“Catalytic converter thefts continue to be a concern and this case highlights how our officers’ quick response and then having immediate access to a drone greatly assisted in these arrests,” Chief Terrence Green said in a statement.

A burglar alarm went off at about 11:40 p.m. at JT’s Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram at 4838 Sunset Boulevard, according to a report. An officer arrived and found a gate open. The officer found several catalytic converters stashed under a truck.

A catalytic converter is part of a vehicle’s exhaust system that turns toxic gases from engines into water and carbon dioxide. The converters contain rhodium and palladium, two valuable metals.

The officer called for backup to set up a perimeter to find the people who had cut the converters from vehicles. Officers found a truck in the woods behind the dealership. A handgun and rifle were on the seat, police said.

The Lexington Police Department’s Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Team used a drone to fly over the woods. The drone found Childers hiding in the woods and police arrested him soon after, according to reports. After cuffing Childers, police found a loaded handgun in his jacket pocket, police said.

Police searched the dealership and found Carn hiding under a pickup truck where he had been removing a catalytic converter, officers said. He had a tool used for cutting metal with him.

Story continues

At least three converters were cut from vehicles, according to police.

Officers jailed both men at Lexington County Detention Center. Childers was released on bond. Carn is still jailed, waiting for another police agency to charge him in a different incident, according to records.

“Law enforcement is rapidly changing with technology and tools evolving that assist our officers daily in making for a safer Town of Lexington,” Green said.

The theft of catalytic converters has surged in the Midlands, especially Lexington County, following a nationwide increase in the crime.

Thieves can make from $50 to several hundred dollars when they sell just one catalytic converter to a scrap yard, according to an article in Car and Driver.

And it can cost a car owner from $1,000 to more than several thousand dollars to get a new catalytic converter put on their car.

In December, state agents charged a Barnwell police officer who made at least $20,000 illegally buying and selling catalytic converters.

If convicted, Childers and Carn face the potential of decades in prison.",
Source: Suspect in Capitol attack suffered delusions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The man who rammed a car into two officers at a barricade outside the U.S. Capitol, killing one of them before he was shot to death by police, had been suffering from delusions, paranoia and suicidal thoughts, a U.S. official told The Associated Press on Saturday. Investigators believe it was an isolated incident from a disturbed young man.

Video of the Friday afternoon attack shows the driver emerging from the crashed car with a knife in his hand and starting to run at the pair of officers, Capitol Police acting Chief Yogananda Pittman told reporters. Police shot the suspect, 25-year-old Noah Green, who died at a hospital.

Investigators are increasingly focused on Green's mental health as they work to identify any motive for the attack, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation and spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity. The official said investigators had talked to Green's family, who spoke of his increasingly delusional thoughts.

In online posts since removed, Green described being under government thought control and said he was being watched. He described himself as a follower of the Nation of Islam and its founder, Louis Farrakhan, and spoke of going through a difficult time when he leaned on his faith. Some of the messages were captured by the group SITE, which tracks online activity.

“To be honest these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher,” he wrote in late March. “I have been tried with some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life. I am currently now unemployed after I left my job partly due to afflictions, but ultimately, in search of a spiritual journey.”

It was the second line-of-duty death this year for the U.S. Capitol Police, still struggling to heal from the Jan. 6 insurrection. The attack underscored that the building and campus — and the officers charged with protecting them — remain potential targets for violence.

Story continues

Authorities installed a giant fence around the Capitol perimeter and for months restricted traffic along the roads closest to the building, but they had begun pulling back some of the emergency measures. And the most recent incident could delay the gradual reopening of the building’s grounds to the public.

“I just ask that the public continue to keep U.S. Capitol Police and their families in your prayers,"" Pittman said. ""This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol Police after the events of Jan. 6 and now the events that have occurred here today.

Police identified the slain officer as William “Billy” Evans, an 18-year veteran who was a member of the department's first responders unit.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hailed Evans as a “martyr for our democracy,” while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was “heartbroken.” Pelosi and Schumer both spoke Friday with members of Evans’ family.

President Joe Biden said in a statement that he and his wife were heartbroken to learn of the attack and expressed condolences to Evans’ family. He directed flags at the White House to be lowered to half-staff.

In 2013, officers with the Capitol Police and Secret Service fatally shot a woman inside her car after she led them on a high-speed chase that began outside the White House. Miriam Carey’s family said she suffered from postpartum depression with psychosis but was not dangerous.

Friday's crash and shooting happened at a security checkpoint near the Capitol typically used by senators and staff on weekdays, though most were away from the building for the current recess. The attack occurred about 100 yards (meters) from the entrance of the building on the Senate side of the Capitol.

The Washington region remains on edge nearly three months after a mob of insurrectionists loyal to former President Donald Trump stormed the building as Congress was voting to certify Biden’s presidential win.

Five people died in the Jan. 6 riot, including Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was among a badly outnumbered force trying to fight off the intruders. It took hours for the National Guard to arrive, a delay that has driven months of finger-pointing among that day’s key decision makers.

Almost 140 Capitol Police officers were wounded in that attack, including officers not issued helmets who sustained head injuries and one with cracked ribs, according to the officers' union. Two officers, one from Capitol Police and another from Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department, died by suicide following the Jan. 6 attack.

Capitol Police and National Guard troops were called upon soon afterward to secure the Capitol during Biden's inauguration and faced another potential threat in early March linked to conspiracy theories falsely claiming Trump would retake the presidency.

The area was locked down for hours Friday but has since reopened, and National Guard troops stood outside the building on Saturday.

Man shot to death on the West Side,"The Daily Beast

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Murder of D.C. father still unsolved 31 years after he was shot to death inside his home,"When Norman Lawrence Rich was a little boy, he was given the nickname “Semo” by his grandmother.

“I’ve never called him Norman - he’s always been Semo to me,” Semo’s younger sister, Sekeithia Tyler told Dateline. After years of not knowing, she finally asked where the nickname came from and their grandmother explained it was because Semo was “intuitive” and could “see more” of the world around him.

The name stuck. Semo and his seven siblings, raised by their mother in Washington, D.C., were close and took care of each other. Semo, being the oldest, stepped in as the provider and learned to work hard from a young age.

“He was like a dad to us,” Sekeithia told Dateline. “And he worked hard. Worked hard to provide for us, and then had his own family and worked hard to provide for them. He was just that type of person. He’d give the shirt off his back for someone in need.”

In March 1990, Semo was living in Washington, D.C. with his girlfriend, Sheila Brown, and their three children - all under the age of 11.

“He was devoted to those children,” Sekeithia said. “He had many jobs over the years, but the most important was the last one of being a stay-at-home dad while Sheila worked. Those kids were his life.”

Sekeithia told Dateline she remembers March 28, 1990 starting out as a typical day. But when she got to work for her 3 p.m. shift, she received news that changed everything.

Her brother Semo had been shot and killed inside his home.

“I went in and a co-worker said, 'Sekeithia, I'm sorry to hear what happened.' And I said, 'You are sorry to hear what?'” she explained to Dateline. “The co-worker said, 'I'm sorry to hear what happened to him.' And I said, 'You are sorry to hear what happened to who?' And then she looked at me and said, 'Sekeithia, Semo was killed this morning.' I said, 'What?' and I just went to the floor.""

Sekeithia said she was in shock when she made her way to her brother’s house in the 500 block of M Street NE. It was now a crime scene.

Story continues

Her family, including her mother, Helen Rich Frazier, and brother, William Thomas, were already there. William, who worked for the D.C. Department of Corrections at the time, told Dateline he had arrived on the scene before they knew the severity of the situation. Yellow police tape lined his brother’s house and William knew something was wrong but said he had to hear it for himself. So he approached one of the officers.

“They told me a man named Norman Rich had been fatally shot,” William said. “I knew what ‘fatally’ meant. He was gone.”

Once William found out that Semo had been shot and killed inside his home, he relayed the devastating news to their mother, who broke down.

The moment their mother found out about her oldest son’s death was captured in an image by a Washington Post photographer and featured on the Metro section's front page.

“There’s a lot of pain in that picture,” William added.

Sekeithia arrived on the scene a short time later to find her mother sitting on the neighbor’s porch.

“There were these bags under my mom’s eyes - they looked like welts - like she had been punched,” Sekeithia said of her mother when she arrived at the scene. “But the bags were from where she had been crying. I saw her and I just went to the floor again.”

According to the initial Metropolitan Police report, Semo’s girlfriend discovered his body in their bedroom at the house around 1 p.m. He had been shot multiple times.

At the scene, after collecting herself from the initial shock, Sekeithia asked her mother where Sheila and the children were. Helen, who had been battling cancer of the larynx, told her in a raspy voice that the children were at a neighbor's and Sheila was being questioned by police.

Sekeithia told Dateline that when Sheila returned, she told them her version of what happened that day. According to the family, Sheila said she it was about 8 a.m. on March 28 when there was a knock on the door. She said there were two men at the door, one she said she recognized as someone called Ducky, and the other she didn’t know, but that he had a brown paper bag underneath his arm. She said she announced to Semo that two men were at the door and she left the house to run errands and get her hair done.

Detective Ruben Sanchez-Serrano was the lead detective on Semo’s case for a few years before he retired. He told Dateline the case still haunts him to this day.

Sanchez, who collected a statement from Sheila Brown that day, told Dateline he remembered her being “very reluctant, she was combative,"" he said. But she offered to help them with composite drawings of the two men she said came to the house that day.

Sanchez told Dateline that many people were questioned and potential suspects emerged, but nothing led to an arrest.

Retired and now living in Florida, 79-year-old Sanchez continues to follow the case and keeps in close contact with Semo’s family and with the many detectives who have worked on the case throughout the years.

He would not comment on possible suspects or any updates on the case as it stands today, but told Dateline he believes the answer to cracking the case lies within the family.

“When they put out a reward for $25,000 and no one comes forward, it was just odd,” Sanchez said. “Especially in the 90s - that was a lot of money.”

But Sanchez, and Semo’s family, told Dateline they have faith in the newest detective on the case and believe he’s the one who will finally solve it.

Detective Michael Fulton, who took over Semo’s case in January 2021, told Dateline that it’s being actively investigated and is hopeful someone will come forward with a key piece of information that will ultimately solve the case and give closure to the family.

Detective Fulton would not comment on these theories or any possible leads in the investigation, but encouraged the public to call police with information.

Semo’s brother, William, told Dateline he’s encouraged by the work Detective Fulton is doing on his brother’s case and believes it will lead to justice.

“For years, a lot of things have not added up,” William said. “But Detective Fulton is going through everything with a fine tooth comb. And that’s what we need. It’s been 31 years - why are we still here? It makes no sense. My brother deserves justice.”

It’s been 31 years, and Sekeithia Tyler has hundreds of journals filled with notes about the case to show for it. She was only 26 years old when her brother was brutally murdered, but she took to the streets immediately to conduct her own investigation. And she hasn’t slowed down.

“People tell me to move on and live my life, but Semo is my life,” Sekeithia said. “God is using me and I believe I can be a blessing to others who are going through the same thing.”

Sekeithia said she still thinks about what her brother would be like if he were alive today. His children are now adults and have children of their own.

She often visits Semo’s gravesite which is next to their mother’s; Helen died of cancer a year after Semo was murdered.

“She had been sick a long time,” Sekeithia said. “But this is what killed our mother. My brother’s murder was the end for her. She never came back from it. And she never got to see him get justice.”

Sekeithia said that even though three decades have passed without answers, she believes they are close to getting the justice they have been fighting for.

“I’ve fought for 31 years to get justice for my brother and I’m not giving up,” Sekeithia told Dateline. “I still have hope.”

The Metropolitan Police Department is offering a $25,000 reward to anyone who provides information which leads to the arrest and conviction of Semo’s killer. Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the Metropolitan Police Department’s Synchronized Operations Command Center (SOCC) at 202 727-9099.",
Historic Houston movie theater closes due to pandemic,"HOUSTON (AP) — A historic Houston theater that director Richard Linklater called his “film school” and that for decades was the place to catch hard-to-find independent and foreign films has closed for good — like many theaters and other businesses, a victim of the coronavirus pandemic.

After nearly 82 years in business, the River Oaks Theatre turned off its projectors last month, depriving the nation's fourth-largest city of an institution where everyone from rappers to suburban kids and cinephiles formed friendships, fell in love and found community. Its loss has left more than just an empty building behind.

“Throughout the pandemic, we’ve experienced so much loss and so much grief and loss of life. It is also a profound grief to lose the places of community and the places that you would come together and feel that love ... that safety,” Leen Dweik, 24, told dozens of other River Oaks fans during a vigil after the theater's final showings.

Dependent on large crowds to survive, U.S. movie theaters have been hammered by the pandemic, as they were shut down for months and saw their revenues plunge by 80% in 2020. Although some have managed to survive with the help of aid and through workarounds, Landmark Theatres, which ran the River Oaks, wasn’t able to reach an agreement with its landlord, Weingarten Realty, over rent it couldn't pay during the pandemic. Weingarten Realty didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

Movie theater trade groups believe their industry will bounce back after the pandemic, in part with the help of more than $16 billion in federal funding from the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program. Theaters are also hoping to get a boost from “Godzilla vs. Kong,” one of the first event movies to be released during the pandemic. And there's cause to be optimistic, as it made $123.1 million internationally last weekend.

About 55% of the 5,800 movie theaters in the U.S. are currently open, but many are still saddled by capacity limits and lingering fears about spending long periods in crowded indoor spaces — justifiable, given the recent case surges in some states despite the ongoing vaccination efforts. In China, where the pandemic is well under control, moviegoing is close to pre-pandemic levels.

“We’re optimistic. Things may change permanently, but it’s not going to be the end of cinema by any means,” said Rich Daughtridge, a board member with the Independent Cinema Alliance, which represents more than 300 independent theater owners.

Patrick Corcoran, a spokesman for the National Association of Theatre Owners, which also represents larger theater chains, said his organization doesn’t have a comprehensive list of theaters that have permanently closed or declared bankruptcy due to the pandemic, but that it's still a relatively small number.

That may be, but several chains have thrown in the towel or shown they're in distress. Cinemagic announced in February that it was closing all eight of its locations in Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire. And two larger chains — Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas Holdings and the company that owns CMX Cinemas — have filed for bankruptcy protection during the pandemic.

“There are still going to be some tough times after we get back to normal, that may still have some effects on companies,” Corcoran said.

Supporters of the River Oaks, including Linklater and Houston rapper Bun B, hope that the theater — with its distinctive marquee, Art Deco architecture and ornate carvings — won’t be torn down or drastically altered and might even be used again to show films or host live performances.

“That was the church I had wandered into (in the early 1980s) and found the holy spirit of cinema,” Linklater, whose films include “Dazed and Confused"" and “Boyhood,"" said during a virtual panel held Wednesday in support of the theater.

The River Oaks opened in 1939 and for the last 45 years, it has mainly operated as an art-house theater showcasing independent and foreign cinema. Although there are other Houston theaters that show such films, none had the profile of the River Oaks.

“We’re not just losing a movie house,” Bun B, a self-described cinephile, said during the panel discussion. “We’re losing one of those places where artists can come and present themselves to the world, but then also young creators can come and ponder what their future might be.”

River Oaks supporters hope the venue doesn’t have the same fate as another nearby historic theater that was converted into a Trader Joe’s grocery store. Although the River Oaks received city landmark status when it was in danger of being torn down in 2007, it could still be razed and the notoriously developer-friendly city doesn’t have a great history of preserving its historic buildings, said Sarah Gish, who helped start the group Friends of River Oaks Theatre to try and save the building.

“The main thing is save the building itself because that is the cultural history. We have already lost so much of the history” in Houston, Linklater said.

The pandemic exacerbated many of the concerns that movie theaters were already facing, including shrinking windows in which to exclusively show films. With some studios now simultaneously releasing new movies in theaters and on streaming platforms, it’s going to be even harder for independent and art house venues like the River Oaks, Bob Berney, CEO of film distributor Picturehouse, said during the panel discussion.

Gish, who worked at the River Oaks in the 1990s, said she still hopes that it might be saved.

“All movie theaters are a repository for huge emotions. They’re community gathering spots, they’re memory makers, all of that. That’s what we’re losing with the River Oaks Theatre going away,” Gish said.

Rapper DMX reported in grave condition in New York hospital,"By Rich McKay

(Reuters) - Popular rapper and actor Earl Simmons, known to his fans by the stage name DMX or Dark Man X, was reported in grave condition Saturday in a New York hospital after suffering a heart attack triggered by an apparent drug overdose, according to the celebrity publications TMZ and Billboard.

The publications reported that Simmons, 50, who has had a public history of substance abuse, was rushed to a White Plains, New York, hospital after suffering a heart attack at his home about 11 p.m. Friday.

His publicist did not immediately respond to Reuters for comment on the singer, who has been a fixture in the music world since the 1990s. Reuters has not independently verified the news accounts.

The musician has been open about his struggles with illegal drug use and has spoken about entering rehab in 2019 after serving time in federal prison on a tax fraud conviction. A Manhattan federal court found that he failed to pay $1.7 million in taxes from 2000 to 2005, by shifting money among accounts belonging to managers and associates.

His debut album in 1998 ""It's Dark and Hell is Hot,"" was listed as number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States and sold more than 5 million copies.

Along with his rap career, Simmons has starred in such films as the 1998 crime drama ""Belly,"" the 2000 action movie ""Romeo Must Die,"" and the 2003 heist film ""Cradle 2 the Grave.""

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch.

So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Michigan's case spike could repeat across US; Italy enters Easter lockdown; Florida bans vaccine passports. Latest COVID-19 updates,"Michigan's governor has blamed the state's recent spike in cases on higher rates of travel, lower rates of mask wearing and previous success keeping cases low in the state, and experts are warning the state's rise in COVID-19 cases could be a sign of things to come for the rest of the nation.

In early April, Michigan has become the worst state in the country in terms of COVID-19 cases per capita. Although the state's vaccine rollout continues, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has said officials may consider restrictions if the community's health is compromised because more patients end up in hospital ICUs.

""Given steady relaxation of social distancing mandates and steady increases in mobility ... a repeat of the Michigan pattern in many other states is a distinct possibility,"" warned a policy briefing from the the University of Washington's Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation.

The Wednesday briefing predicted COVID-19 deaths will continue to remain constant until early May but warned it is ""very possible"" that daily deaths can increase until mid-May as Americans travel at increasingly higher rates.

This comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated travel guidelines Friday for vaccinated Americans, advising travelers within the U.S. don't need to quarantine and don't need to get tested before or after their trips, unless destination requires it. Still, the agency recommended travelers continue observing precautions like social distancing and masks.

Also in the news:

►Dolly Parton shared on social media that she received her second vaccine dose Friday. The country music legend received her first dose March 2 after she said she's been waiting since December. She previously told USA TODAY she won't jump the vaccination line despite her helping fund the Moderna vaccine with a $1 million donation.

►Italy entered a three-day strict lockdown over Easter to prevent new cases that may arise from holiday traveling. Non-essential businesses are closed and police set up road checks to ensure people are staying close to home.

Story continues

►Moderna can put 50% more vaccine dosage in each vial, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday. The company has been manufacturing 10 dose vials, but the FDA's decision allows the company to put up to 15 doses in each vial, a move that allows Moderna to speed up shipments and get more shots in arms.

►California will allow indoor concerts, theater performances and other private gatherings starting April 15, state officials announced Friday.

►Colorado will no longer require masks to be worn in most settings in the 31 counties that are on the lowest level of the state's COVID-19 dial system, Gov. Jared Polis' office announced Friday.

►Health officials in Nevada said Friday they expect a big first wave of people signing up get appointments for COVID-19 vaccinations when eligibility expands next week to everyone age 16 and older. Some will need to try more than once, they said.

📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has more than 30.6 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 554,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The global totals: More than 130 million cases and 2.8 million deaths. At least 204 million vaccine doses have been distributed in the U.S. and 158 million have been administered, according to the CDC.

📘 What we're reading: COVID-19 vaccines may reduce transmission, experts say. Here's why vaccinated Americans should still wear masks in public.

Florida bans businesses from requiring vaccine passports

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order Friday, effective immediately, that bans businesses from requiring customers to show proof they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to get service.

The executive order also bans government agencies from issuing these vaccine passports and argues that requiring such proof would ""create two classes of citizens based on vaccination.""

DeSantis has directed state agencies that regulate bars, restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes to ensure that businesses are complying with the order. Any business in violation will not be eligible for grants or contracts funded with state tax dollars.

Thousands die of COVID-19 amid vaccine rollout

More than 247,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. since vaccines first became available mid-December.

Officials had warned that dispensing enough vaccines to reach herd immunity would take months. And with the initial vaccine supply extremely limited and the virus running rampant across the nation over the winter, it was a sad reality that some would contract COVID-19 and die before they could be inoculated.

Charlotte Crawford of Dallas, who was fully vaccinated in January because of her job, watched her husband and two adult children contract the virus and die before they could get shots. Her husband, Henry Royce Crawford, 65, had an appointment for a vaccine when he fell ill, but her children could not find appointments.

With the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines requiring two doses, there have also been deaths during the period of weeks between the first and second shot when a recipient remains vulnerable and subject to infection.

Richard Rasmussen, 73, of Las Vegas, got his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in early January. Yet he tested positive for the virus 10 days later and died Feb. 19 before receiving a second dose, his daughter Julie Rasmussen said.

Arizona governor feuds with Phoenix over Easter park access

Gov. Doug Ducey has demanded that Phoenix open public park amenities for the Easter weekend after the Phoenix City Council voted last month to prohibit grilling and close parking lots to prevent crowding.

In a letter to Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego on Friday, Ducey criticized the city for attempting to limit park visitors, writing that the council's decision is in violation of a statewide executive order and the advice of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Gallego responded to the governor with her own sharply worded letter, saying the city would continue with its plans and that Ducey had no legal standing to make such demands.

""This crisis has made clear to all of Arizona that you put partisan politics ahead of saving lives. It is also no surprise that you have expressed your opinion in a partisan, divisive way rather than in a genuine effort to keep our residents safe,"" Gallego wrote.

CDC announces next steps to getting cruise ships back in US waters

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued the next phase of its Framework for Conditional Sailing Order, the guidance that will lead to getting cruise ships sailing again in U.S. waters.

The initial conditional sailing order came out in late October, and cruise operators have since been waiting for further guidance. In an announcement late Friday, the CDC said the second phase of the order will include trial voyages to practice new COVID-19 operational procedures with volunteers before sailing with paying passengers.

The CDC update, described in a news release as ""technical guidance,"" also includes a requirement to increase cruise COVID-19 reporting frequency to daily. There was no clarity in the guidance, however, about when cruise ships can start sailing again in U.S. waters.

FDA authorizes 2 rapid coronavirus tests for home screening

Consumers will soon be able to buy rapid coronavirus tests at chain pharmacies and grocers without a prescription after the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized two home tests.

The BinaxNOW coronavirus self-test will include two tests per kit for serial screening. The no-prescription test will deliver results in 15 minutes and does not require a lab. The FDA also authorized the Quidel QuickVue coronavirus test, which delivers results in 10 minutes and also can be used without a prescription.

The FDA has authorized more than 300 coronavirus tests and technologies in what's becoming an increasingly crowded field of medical labs and tech firms touting different technologies.

The federal agency authorized only two other no-prescription home tests, but the companies that make those tests are ramping up production, and the tests not yet available to purchase. Several more tests allow people to collect nasal or saliva samples at home, but people must send samples to a lab, which delays results for one to two days.

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen.

Vaccine passport efforts draw opposition from GOP lawmakers,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Vaccine passports being developed to verify COVID-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine have become the latest flash point in America’s perpetual political wars, with Republicans portraying them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private health choices.

They currently exist in only one state — a limited government partnership in New York with a private company — but that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers in a handful of states from rushing out legislative proposals to ban their use.

The argument over whether passports are a sensible response to the pandemic or governmental overreach echoes the bitter disputes over the past year about masks, shutdown orders and even the vaccines themselves.

Vaccine passports are typically an app with a code that verifies whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for COVID-19. They are in use in Israel and under development in parts of Europe, seen as a way to safely help rebuild the pandemic- devastated travel industry.

They are intended to allow businesses to more safely open up as the vaccine drive gains momentum, and they mirror measures already in place for schools and overseas travel that require proof of immunization against various diseases.

But lawmakers around the country are already taking a stand against the idea. GOP senators in Pennsylvania are drawing up legislation that would prohibit vaccine passports, also known as health certificates or travel passes, from being used to bar people from routine activities.

“We have constitutional rights and health privacy laws for a reason,” said Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican. “They should not cease to exist in a time of crisis. These passports may start with COVID-19, but where will they end?”

Benninghoff said this week his concern was “using taxpayer money to generate a system that will now be, possibly, in the hands of mega-tech organizations who’ve already had problems with getting hacked and security issues.”

Story continues

A Democratic colleague, Rep. Chris Rabb of Philadelphia, sees value in vaccine passports if they are implemented carefully.

“There’s a role for using technology and other means to confirm people’s statuses,” Rabb said. “But we do have concerns around privacy, surveillance and inequitable access.”

Republican legislators in other states have also been drafting proposals to ban or limit them. A bill introduced in the Arkansas Legislature on Wednesday would prevent government officials from requiring vaccine passports for any reason, and would ban their use as a condition of “entry, travel, education, employment or services.”

The sponsor, Republican state Sen. Trent Garner, called vaccine passports “just another example of the Biden administration using COVID-19 to put regulations or restrictions on everyday Americans.”

President Joe Biden's administration has largely taken a hands-off approach on vaccine passports.

At a news conference this week, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he considered them a project for the private sector, not the government.

He said the government is considering federal guidelines to steer the process surrounding vaccine passports. Among its concerns: Not everyone who would need a passport has a smartphone; passports should be free and in multiple languages; and private health information must be protected.

""There will be organizations that want to use these. There will be organizations that don’t want to use these,” said Dr. Brian Anderson of Mitre, which operates federally funded research centers and is part of a coalition working to develop standards for vaccine certifications to make their use easier across vendors.

Anderson noted the Vaccination Credential Initiative is not making recommendations on how — or even if — organizations choose to use the certifications.

In Montana, GOP lawmakers this week voted along party lines to advance a pair of bills that would ban discrimination based on vaccine status or possession of an immunity passport, and to prohibit using vaccine status or passports to obtain certain benefits and services.

And a freshman Republican state lawmaker in Ohio spoke out about the concept, saying more restrictions or mandates are not the answer to every COVID-19 problem.

“Ohioans are encouraged to take the COVID-19 vaccine for the health and well-being of themselves and others,” Rep. Al Cutrona said. “However, a vaccine should not be mandated or required by our government for our people to integrate back to a sense of normalcy.”

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday issued an executive order that said no governmental entity can issue a vaccine passport, and businesses in that state can't require them. He said he expected the Legislature to pass a similar law.

His order said requiring ""so-called COVID-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life — such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant, or going to a movie theater — would create two classes of citizens.”

U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, a newly elected member who has embraced and promoted a range of far-right political positions, told her supporters on Facebook earlier this week that “something called a vaccine passport” was a form of “corporate communism” and part of a Democratic effort to control people’s lives.

And a GOP lawmaker in Louisiana has teed up a bill to keep the state from including any vaccination information on the Louisiana driver’s license or to make issuance of a driver’s license subject to vaccine status.

In New York, a government-sponsored vaccine passport called the Excelsior Pass is being introduced. A smartphone app, it shows whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for COVID-19.

Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted the idea as letting an event venue usher, for example, use their own smartphone to scan a concertgoer’s code.

New York officials have not released specific details about how the app will work, access someone’s vaccination or testing status or protect a user’s name, date of birth or the location where their code was scanned. The app’s privacy policy says data will be “maintained in a secure manner” and won’t be used for sales or marketing purposes or shared with a third party. But some privacy experts say the public needs more specifics to ensure its information is protected.

Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at the Urban Justice Center, a New York–based civil rights and privacy group, warned the Excelsior Pass creates a new layer of surveillance without sufficient details about how it collects data or protects privacy.

""We basically only have screenshots of the user interface and not much more,” Cahn said of Excelsior Pass.

The dreaded “C” word is something no one wants to hear their doctor say. While cancer is terrifying, it’s crucial to catch this disease early to increase chances of survival and stop the growth or spread in its tracks. Learning about a few signs that you’ve developed cancer is one way to be proactive about catching this disease early. Review these 8 signs you have cancer so you can take them seriously and catch this dreaded disease early. As for our current pandemic: Read on—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don’t miss these Signs Your Illness is Actually Coronavirus in Disguise. 1 Lumps and Swelling in Lymph Nodes When your body is fighting off a cold, flu, or other sickness, the lymph nodes in your neck and armpits might swell or look enlarged. This is perfectly normal and a sign that your body is working overtime to try and kill the illness quickly. However, swelling in your lymph nodes should go away in a couple of weeks and if they remain swollen or develop lumps, it’s a sign that something else may be wrong.The Rx: According to Dr. Adrian Bloor from The Christie Private Care, “If you discover a new lump or swelling which does not go away after a few days, then the recommendation is to seek medical attention so that it can be thoroughly assessed. It could be an early indicator of blood cancer.” Your swollen lymph nodes could be nothing, but it could also be a sign of lymphoma, leukemia, or myeloma. 2 Blood in Your Stool Seeing blood in your stool can be scary and it’s important to take note if you see any red when you go to the bathroom. Blood in your stool could be due to a number of ailments, some of which aren’t very serious. However, it could also be an indication of colon cancer. The Rx: According to Dr. Mache Seibel, “Of course you can have blood in your stool for instance because you have a fissure or a crack in the tissues around your rectum or from a hemorrhoid or from ulcerative colitis or many other kinds of diseases. Blood is just a warning sign; it’s not a guarantee of cancer.” However, Johns Hopkins Medicine confirms that obvious bright red blood in the stool or darker bowel movements that indicate blood should be investigated for potential colon cancer. Go see your doctor if you see blood in your stool so colon cancer can be ruled out.RELATED: The Easiest Way to Avoid a Heart Attack, Say Doctors 3 Hoarse Voice That Won’t Go Away If you had too much to drink the night before, rode some roller coasters, or saw your favorite band, a hoarse voice is explainable. Recovering from a cold or other sickness may also cause you to deal with a hoarse voice for a few days. However, if your voice unexplainably becomes hoarse and this hoarseness lasts for several weeks, it may be a sign of larynx cancer. The Rx: According to Dr. Dale Ekbom, M.D. from the Mayo Clinic, “When hoarseness lasts more than two weeks, the list of potential causes grows much larger.” He mentions cancer of the larynx as a possible explanation of long-term hoarseness and states that when “detected early, vocal cord cancer can often be successfully treated with surgery or radiation.” Your hoarseness may be related to a lingering sickness or a simple irritation of your vocal cords, but it’s best to get it checked out if it persists. 4 Jaundice Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and eyes that may cause itchiness and irritation or may not be felt at all. The skin turns yellow when your bile duct is blocked by a tumor and a yellow pigment called bilirubin builds up in the system. Jaundice may be treatable through medication or surgery. The Rx: However, it’s the cause of the jaundice that’s concerning. According to a study reviewed by Dr. Peter Saul, “Approximately half of patients are diagnosed with a tumor within the head of the pancreas and many of these will present with jaundice.” If your skin takes on a yellowish tint, it’s best to see your doctor right away to ensure you don't have pancreatic cancer. 5 A Skin Growth on Your Head or Neck According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), about two million Americans every year are diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer. Catching this type of skin cancer early is crucial to stop it from spreading. The good news is this type of skin cancer grows slowly but the bad news is it’s easily mistaken for a pimple or scar.The Rx: The AAD warns that basal cell carcinoma “often develops on the head or neck and looks like a shiny, raised, and round growth.” If you see any abnormal skin growths or irritations that look like this, schedule an appointment with your dermatologist. While this growth may be nothing, it could indicate basal cell carcinoma, and if caught early, it’s a simple procedure to get it removed. 6 Seizures Seizures are serious and scary and if you experience one, you should seek emergency medical treatment and consult with your doctor about the cause. In some instances, a seizure may be a result of a brain tumor or growth, which could be cancerous. The Rx: According to Dr. Jessica W. Templer, MD from Northwestern Medicine Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, “Patients may not be aware that seizures are a consequence of their brain tumor. The seizures caused from brain tumors are complex and different for each patient depending on the type and location of the tumor.” Your seizure could indicate an abnormal glucose level or a benign tumor but it’s best to seek treatment right away to find out if brain cancer was the cause of your episode.RELATED: Most COVID Patients Did This Before Getting Sick 7 A Single and Hard Breast Lump According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, one in eight women in the U.S. will develop breast cancer at some point in her lifetime. Early detection is key to stopping the spread of breast cancer. Lumps and bumps on your breast tissue are signs that cancer might be growing. However, the professionals at Stony Brook Cancer Center’s Carol M. Baldwin Breast Care Center state, “Most breast lumps—80% of those biopsied —are benign (non-cancerous).” The Rx: While most lumps and bumps aren’t cancerous, it’s important to look out for single, hard lumps on your breasts. These medical professionals warn that “most malignant tumors appear first as single, hard lumps or thickenings that are frequently, but not always, painless.” If you see any bumps, thickenings, or abnormalities, consult with your doctor and get a mammogram right away. 8 White or Gray Patches in Your Mouth You might find white patches in your mouth as an irritation from food, braces, dentures, or a retainer. However, if you notice thickened areas in your mouth that are white or gray and can’t be scraped off, it’s possible you’ve developed leukoplakia, which is a tissue change that may be precancerous.The Rx: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are about 657,000 new oral cancer cases developed in the world each year. If you’re a tobacco user, frequently drink alcohol, or live an unhealthy lifestyle, you’re more likely to develop a form of oral cancer. Your leukoplakia may be treatable and not lead to oral cancer but only if it’s caught early.

George Floyd's addiction could change how we talk about drug abuse and Black Americans,"Like millions of Americans, George Floyd lived with the torment of drug addiction.

He and his girlfriend, Courteney Ross, became addicted to opioids four years ago after they were both prescribed for chronic pain. When the prescriptions ran out, they turned to illegal drug use, she said. They tried to go clean, then failed. They tried again, but could not stop for long.

As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the United States, Floyd, the father of two young daughters, started using again: he lost his job as a nightclub security guard because of quarantine shutdowns, he was hospitalized for several days after an overdose, he found out he had the coronavirus. On the day he died, his neck trapped under the knee of former Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin for more than nine minutes, he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system, toxicology reports later showed.

“We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,” Ross said tearfully Thursday during testimony in the Chauvin trial over Floyd's death.

Floyd's death helped launch a global civil rights movement over racial injustice and police violence. The trial over his death could similarly shape how Americans view drug addiction at a time when Black people continue to overwhelmingly be denied medical treatment compared to white Americans even as they suffer from disproportionately high rates of fatal opioid overdoses.

George Floyd's family raise their hands as attorney Ben Crump (out of frame) speaks at a press conference outside the family justice center after a court hearing on the murder of George Floyd on Sept. 11, 2020, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Four police officers accused of contributing to the death of George Floyd, the 46-year-old African-American man whose death in May sparked nationwide protests, appeared together in Minneapolis court for the first time that day.

Chauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, has sought to persuade jurors that drugs – not Chauvin's knee clamping down on Floyd's neck as he cried ""I can't breathe"" while handcuffed on the ground – contributed to Floyd's death.

Prosecutors, family members and medical experts have said Floyd's history of addiction does not explain how he died. Chauvin, who is white, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man.

""George was walking, talking, laughing, and breathing just fine before Derek Chauvin held his knee to George’s neck,” Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, lawyers for Floyd’s family, said in a statement Thursday morning. “Tens of thousands of Americans struggle with self-medication and opioid abuse and are treated with dignity, respect and support, not brutality.”

Drug use has been used to justify the death of other Black people who have been killed by white police officers, including Michael Brown in Missouri, said Scott Nolen, director of the Addiction and Health Equity program at the Open Society Institute–Baltimore, which works to reduce drug addiction. Strucural racism makes it so people of color who use drugs are wrongly seen as ""throwaways,"" he said.

Andre Johnson, CEO of the Detroit Recovery Program, a drug addiction support program, said people relapse because of inadequate resources.

The Chauvin defense ""really sheds light on how people of color, Black people, are treated when they have an addiction. What they are failing to do is treat George Floyd as a whole person,"" said Johnson. ""The fact that he used drugs is not why he died. He died because he was a big Black man and a white man did not value his life.""

Opioids made addiction a 'white drug problem'

The notion of treating drug addiction as a medical condition and not a moral failing became more widespread in the 2000s based on emerging research and as prescription opioid pain relievers became popular and thousands of white people began to die from overdoses.

Unlike previous drug crises that primarily hurt low-income Americans and people of color, victims of opioid drug addiction were often portrayed by lawmakers and the media as ordinary white Americans who had fallen prey to a highly addictive substance.

""One of the first things you notice is that when drug addiction, in particularly opioid addiction, became seen as a white drug problem, suddenly people were deeply interested in the origin of your drug addiction, they were interested in origin stories that made you not responsible,"" said Ekow N. Yankah, a criminal law expert and professor at Cardozo School of Law in New York City. ""Those origin stories were never available to Black people, in particular Black urban dwellers. No one cared why you got hooked on drugs.""

In subsequent years, many Republican and Democratic lawmakers began to embrace legal marijuana, reducing sentences for low-level drug offenders and drug addiction treatment instead of criminal charges. The political movement has represented a significant departure from federal drug policy of the past that often resulted in Black men serving long sentences for nonviolent crack cocaine crimes, while white offenders who used cocaine got comparatively light jail time.

""There is no question if crack had been a white kid's disease it would have ended up in treatment, but it ended up in everyone going to jail,"" said Robert Stutman, the special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's New York office during the 1980s war against crack cocaine.

Of the more than 840,000 people who have died since 1999 from a drug overdose, more than 70% in 2019 involved an opioid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the opioid crisis has largely claimed white lives, opioid-involved overdose death rates in the Black community have skyrocketed in recent years, federal data show.

The addiction journey of Ross, who is white, and Floyd could help Americans see Black drug users in a sympathetic light, medical and legal experts said.

""They are ordinary drug users, they are ordinary people struggling with drug use. Black people end up hooked on drugs for the exact same reasons white people do,"" said Yankah, the law professor.

Black people denied lifesaving anti-addiction drug

Many Americans now better understand that people grappling with drug addiction cannot easily stop abusing substances.

""People use drugs for a variety of reasons, including managing physical and emotional pain. It's because of those many reasons that oftentimes it's hard to stop using,"" said Sheila P. Vakharia, deputy director of the research and academic engagement for the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit based in New York.

And yet Black people are often denied the same lifesaving medical treatment as white Americans to address opioid addiction, research shows. One study found Black patients were 77% less likely to receive buprenorphine, a drug that limits the desire for opioids.

Instead, Black Americans are often prescribed methadone, which requires most patients to show up at a medical office every day to get the drug, a significant barrier for low-income Americans, including many people of color, who do not work flexible hours or have access to transportation.

""The way we give it to people is really terrible. Imagine if we made someone do that for their blood pressure medicine or their diabetes medicine,"" said Vakharia.

For Americans without health insurance, both forms of treatment are often out of reach. And Hispanic, Asian and Black Americans are more likely to be uninsured than white Americans.

""The impact of incarceration, arrests and marginalization, which stem from racially motivated and punitive drug laws, adds to the physical suffering and makes it more difficult to get treatment and be treated humanely. It is these attitudes that give license to the Floyd defense team to try to paint him as worthless and 'sick' because he suffered from addiction,"" said Deborah Agus, executive director of the Behavioral Health Leadership Institute in Baltimore, which focuses on ensuring vulnerable populations have access to better addiction treatment.

Data shows Americans are using heroin and fentanyl at the same rate, but the increase in opioid-related death rates among people of color is likely the result of disproportionate access to treatment for these groups compared to white Americans, said Dr. Pooja Lagisetty, a health services researcher at the University of Michigan whose research showed the disparity in buprenorphine treatment.

Both the prosecution and defense took care while discussing Floyd's addiction. Such an approach would have been unimaginable two decades ago, medical and legal experts said.

Nelson on Thursday began his cross-examination of Ross with a display of sympathy: “I’m sorry to hear about your struggles with opioid addiction,” he began. “Thank you for sharing that with the jury.”

Meanwhile, the prosecution's prompting of Ross to discuss how she and Floyd struggled with drugs as opposed to downplaying the drug use was also atypical.

In the past, drug use has been cited to villainize witnesses, suspects and those killed by police, especially when they were Black, said several medical and legal experts.

""I don't think a defense attorney in the '80s or '90s would have said, 'I'm sorry you are struggling with heroin or cocaine or crack' in those times when it was considered an inner-city drug,"" said Yankah, of Cardozo Law.

'It looks like he's probably on something'

Floyd died on Memorial Day 2020 after police responded to a 911 call alleging that he had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. Three other former police officers who responded to the call face charges in Floyd's death.

Chauvin defended his actions to a witness after Floyd's unresponsive body was taken away in an ambulance.

""We had to control this guy because he's a sizable guy. It looks like he's probably on something,"" Chauvin is heard saying in a video.

In contrast, Chauvin's own troubled past, including 18 complaints filed against him in 19 years as a Minneapolis police officer, will not be the focus of the criminal trial to avoid influencing the jury against him.

In her testimony, Ross, 45, described Floyd as a fun, kind man who offered to pray with her the first time they met, when she was visiting her son's father at a homeless shelter where Floyd worked as a security guard.

Courteney Ross, center, who had been dating George Floyd, reacts after a memorial service for Floyd at North Central University on Thursday, June 4, 2020, in Minneapolis.

She said he was active and never had trouble breathing before his run-in with Chauvin.

Keith Humphreys, a behavioral sciences professor at Stanford University in California and a former member of the George W. Bush White House Advisory Commission on Drug Free Communities, said if Chauvin and other officers suspected Floyd was high, they should have taken it more seriously when he said he couldn't breathe because opioid use can slow respiration.

""Even if he was addicted, he didn't deserve to be killed. It shows the devaluation of the lives of people with drug problems,"" Humphreys said. ""Police take into custody millions of intoxicated people every year without this happening.""

NBCThis post contains spoilers for Law & Order: SVU and Law & Order: Organized Crime.Reunited, and it feels so... well, not good, really. On Thursday night, Law & Order finally reunited NBC’s most beloved platonic couple: After a decade apart, Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler are back on the case. Unfortunately, it took the death of Stabler’s wife, Kathy, at the hands of a mysterious, high-level criminal to make it happen.Thursday marks the premiere of Meloni’s new Law & Order spinoff, Organized Crime. Given the magnitude of Benson and Stabler’s (Babe-ler’s?) reunion, it should come as no surprise that NBC blew the event up into a crossover event with SVU—which opened on Kathy Stabler being wheeled into an ambulance as a stunned Olivia looked on. Apparently, despite the fact that the Stablers have been living overseas, they’ve become a bombing target here in the U.S. Maybe it has something to do with Elliot’s new job?As Stabler explains, he went on a walkabout for a few years after his departure from the NYPD; he began working private security and eventually, he wound up working as an international liaison handling terrorism, sex-trafficking, and organized crime. He came to New York to testify on a case, and Kathy had tagged along. Apparently, the police placard in their rental car tipped off the bomber.Kathy initially survived the attack, but later died in the hospital of a ruptured spleen. Benson and her team are able to track down the suspected bomber, but soon enough he, too, is found dead in his cell from an overdose. The explosive appears to have been an international design.Life After ‘SVU’: Christopher Meloni on ‘They Came Together,’ Stabler, and His Famous BehindSadly for Kathy, her brush with death is mostly just a plot device to bring Benson and Stabler together (and, of course, launch Stabler’s new standalone TV gig). Benson volunteers to lead the bombing investigation, and allows her old partner to accompany her during the first interrogation, where they question a QAnon devotee. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the perpetrator in this case is someone far more sophisticated.A lot has changed since last time Stabler appeared onscreen. In his latter seasons, especially, Meloni’s character became known for his hot temper and propensity for bending the rules—qualities that have not aged well in light of recent discussions of how cop procedurals have promoted harmful ideas about policing. So as Stabler made his grand return, viewers also got a healthy dose of hand-wringing about how “good” or “bad” of a cop he might be now. “Don’t tell me, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore, please,’” Stabler tells Benson at one point. “I’ve been living out of New York, not under a rock.” Vouching for his former colleague to a newer peer, Finn insists, “End of the day, he’s a good cop.”Eventually, Stabler loses his cool over the questions: “I’m pretty sick of people judging me for who I was 12 years ago,” he says. “I was a good cop then, I’m a good cop now.”As Ayanna Bell, the organized crime officer in charge of hunting down the criminal element responsible for his wife’s apparent murderer, shoots back, “Guys who came up when you did, you guys never think you need to change your ways.”But the chief order of business in hour one of this crossover event, naturally, was addressing the distance that’s festered between Stabler and Benson in their decade apart.It’s been 10 years since Benson and Stabler worked a case together. Meloni’s last episode, the Season 12 finale, ended with Stabler shooting the daughter of a rape victim, who’d open fire in the NYPD precinct with a gun she’d purchased off the street. In subsequent episodes, Benson learned her longtime partner had resigned. The two have not spoken since.“Are you sorry for leaving, or are you sorry for walking—for not giving me the courtesy of telling me?” Benson asks. “You were the single most important person in my life. And you just... disappeared.”“I know,” Elliot replies. “I was afraid. If I heard your voice, I wouldn’t have been able to leave.”Stabler and Benson’s partnership was always, erm, shall we say... intense? That fact came up Thursday night as well, as newer squad members, including Amanda Rollins, hint at the ambiguous “thing” the pair notoriously shared. Stabler seems curious when Finn mentions Olivia’s romantic relationships, and tries to glean some information out of his old colleague—only to be told he’ll need to ask himself.At the risk of sounding crass about poor Kathy’s death, her tragic fate does prompt one, yes, very crass question: Are we finally, after all these years, going to see Stabler and Benson kiss? Pretty please?Right now, however, Stabler obviously has bigger fish to fry. Kathy’s murder case is officially out of Benson’s jurisdiction, although that’s no guarantee she’ll stand down. Stabler’s youngest son, Eli, is shattered over his mother’s death and despondent that the family will not be returning to Rome. (Sadly, NBC apparently does not have the funds to give us Law & Order Takes Tuscany.) Stabler himself, meanwhile, has already begun grilling international criminals and chasing down leads, continually referring back to a smuggling case he’d been working in Puglia. Turns out, medical supplies have become a lucrative source of money for organized crime rings during COVID times. At the root of all this, it seems, is Freddie (Dylan McDermott)—the son of a notorious mob boss named Sinatra (yes, Sinatra) whose goons were also behind the Puglia PPE smuggling. Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

UK says 5 million get second shot as COVID daily deaths fall to 10,"The Conversation

Holocaust survivor Shalom Stamberg holds a book with a photo of himself in Auschwitz, alongside a copy of his concentration camp record. AP Photo/Ariel SchalitOne in four American millennials believe the Holocaust was exaggerated or entirely made up, according to a recent national survey that sought to find out what young adults know about the genocide of nearly 6 million Jews at the hands of Nazis some 80 years ago. That startling statistic was cited as one of the main reasons that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided in October to finally ban Holocaust denial across the social network. Denying the Holocaust ever happened is an enduring form of anti-Semitic propaganda that attempts to deny or minimize the atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jews during World War II. Following Facebook’s lead, Twitter announced it, too, would remove any posts that denied the history of the Holocaust, though CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to contradict that policy at a Senate hearing weeks later. Holocaust deniers have continued to emerge in social media, and perhaps predictably, many have migrated to less restrictive sites like Parler, where hashtags like #HolocaustNeverHappened and #HolocaustIsALie are widespread. “If you want Holocaust denial, hey, Parler is going to be great for you,” Bill Gates recently said of the social network. While some tech companies address the rise in Holocaust revisionism, and others leave the door open, social networks have played an unwitting role in helping to distort the memory of these horrific events. But as a scholar who studies online extremism, I believe that same community could do more to protect Holocaust remembrance by highlighting the digitized accounts of those who lived through it. French Holocaust survivor Victor Perahia, interned as a child in the Drancy camp outside Paris and then deported to Bergen-Belsen, speaks to students during a January 2020 workshop dedicated to Holocaust remembrance at Drancy. AP Photo/Christophe Ena A decadeslong campaign Holocaust denial has been a tool of anti-Semitic movements since the 1960s. Pseudo-academic groups like the Institute for Historical Review, for example, spent years working to distort the public’s aging memory of the Holocaust, which took place between 1933 and 1945. They tried to cast doubt on the feasibility of the mass executions, and even the existence of the gas chambers. They held annual conferences and gathered fellow deniers to share their beliefs that these events were conjured up by the Jewish people mostly as a means to justify the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. A photo taken April 12, 1945, shows just some of the bodies found by U.S. troops when they arrived at Nordhausen concentration camp in Germany. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library For decades, most people quickly discarded those claims, because they had heard the firsthand accounts of the survivors who were sent to the camps and witnessed the daily operation of genocide and murder of family members. The allegations of the deniers could also not withstand the accounts of soldiers who liberated the camps and made the terrible discoveries of body-filled crematoriums and mass graves. But for deniers, Holocaust revision has little to do with history. Denialism is really a pretext for delivering anti-Semitism in the form of “scholarship,” although few academics ever gave it such attention. So hate groups had to find other means of circulation. They found it online. An image from a film taken during the Soviet liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in early 1945 shows children who had survived the Holocaust. Belarusian State Archive of Documentary Film and Photography/United States Holocaust Memorial Museum via Wikimedia Commons A conspiracy resurrected When the internet took off in the late 1990s, Holocaust deniers and countless other conspiracy theorists saw an opportunity to spread their ideas to new audiences. Anti-Semitic groups could now publish their distortions in well-visited forums, and later in faux-informational websites like Metapedia and The Occidental Observer – extremist communities, in fact, that collectively receive some 350,000 visitors each month. The internet also gave Holocaust deniers an opportunity to reach a much wider public through social media. As early as 2009, Facebook groups emerged that were dedicated to “debunking” the Holocaust, as #Holohoax became a popular hashtag on Twitter, which it continues to be today. Reddit also became a far-right haven for Holocaust deniers, one of whom gained national attention when he was the invited guest of a Florida congressman to the 2018 State of the Union address. For deniers, the internet helped repackage their conspiracy into something less recognizable than hate. I’ve long studied this process, which I call information laundering, tracking illegitimate forms of information, like Holocaust denial, that flow through social networks, blogs and search engines. There they intermix with mainstream ideas and slowly become washed of their radical origins. This decadeslong campaign has resulted in the current surveys that show nearly a quarter of young adults are misinformed or skeptical about the Holocaust. Only now, few survivors are left to correct the record. That makes it even more important to spread the truth. Perhaps the internet can help. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower views the charred bodies of prisoners after the 1945 liberation of the Nazis’ Ohrdruf concentration camp. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library Eisenhower’s intuition When Gen. Dwight Eisenhower visited the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945, after its liberation by U.S. forces, he realized how impossible it might be for people to believe the scale of Nazi atrocities. He wrote powerfully of the experience, and of his reasons for going to see it in person: “The things I saw beggar description. … In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. … I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the near future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to ‘propaganda.’” Eisenhower’s words are instructions for future generations. They underscore the need to be a witness to human cruelty in order to protect the memory of, and lessons learned from, these events from those who would try to distort them. Back online, it may not be enough for social networks to ban Holocaust denial. Similar bans in Europe haven’t limited the rise of anti-Semitism there. Instead, social networks could follow Eisenhower’s example by answering the falsehoods of Holocaust deniers with the true stories of survivors. The internet is already home to thousands of digitized survivor testimonies. They include oral histories that could be readily activated by social networks to refute those who deny the existence of the gas chambers with the accounts of those who stood inside them or witnessed them at work. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit might share the firsthand stories of the Nazi persecutions, separations at the camps or rare reunions, wherever false claims arise, to counter denials with facts. Holocaust survivor Cecilie Klein-Pollack, the author’s grandmother. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum In the spirit of that counternarrative, I will place my grandmother’s story here. She was a Holocaust survivor. She later wrote about her experiences in Auschwitz, where, upon arrival, she and her sister were separated from their mother and her sister’s son, never to see them again. There are millions of other experiences like hers, and survivors of other genocides whose stories must be retold as well, from Armenia to Rwanda. [Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.] Holocaust deniers have long waited for the time when there were no remaining survivors or witnesses to keep these histories alive. But the internet is a powerful archive. Social networks have an opportunity to combat hateful disinformation by posting the personal stories of these tragedies, and end the so-called “debate” about whether the Holocaust ever happened. As Eisenhower well understood, history needs protecting.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

Ukraine approves Chinese vaccine as COVID-19 cases hit new record high,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine has approved China's Sinovac vaccine to fight the coronavirus pandemic, the health ministry said on Saturday, after the country recorded a record rise in new COVID-19 cases for the second day in a row.

Ukraine received its first batch of 215,000 Sinovac doses in March to boost its vaccination programme, which has lagged behind many other European countries and it has so far relied on a single batch of AstraZeneca vaccines from India.

But authorities delayed using the Chinese vaccine, saying its local supplier had not provided the necessary paperwork and that the vaccine needed additional laboratory checks.

""As part of the vaccinations against COVID-19, Ukraine will use the CoronaVac vaccine from Sinovac Biotech,"" the health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.

""The vaccines of the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech can be trusted,"" it said.

Ukraine is tightening lockdown restrictions in the worst-hit areas as coronavirus cases have soared after a winter lull.

The capital Kyiv will impose a strict lockdown from April 5, restricting public transport and closing all schools and kindergartens.

The city has already banned public events, and has closed cafes and restaurants in an attempt to halt the new wave.

Ukraine recorded a record increase of 20,341 new infections over the preceding 24 hours, Health Minister Maksym Stepanov said on Saturday.

Writing on his social media page, Stepanov said 5,186 people were hospitalised in the same period, and 396 people had died, bringing the total death toll since the start of the pandemic to 34,075 in the country of 41 million people.

China reports 26 new COVID-19 cases; Myanmar link seen in Yunnan,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Mainland China reported 26 new COVID-19 cases on April 2, up from nine a day earlier, the country's national health authority said on Saturday, as officials in the country's southwest linked a local outbreak to Myanmar.

The National Health Commission said seven of the new cases were local infections in Yunnan province, where a COVID-19 cluster has emerged in the city of Ruili bordering Myanmar.

Genetic analysis of cases in Ruili suggest they stemmed from viruses imported from Myanmar and are not related to other recent localised outbreaks in China, state media reported, citing a press briefing.

Ruili is a key transit point for Yunnan province, which has struggled to monitor its rugged 4,000 km (2,500-mile) border with Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam for illegal immigration amid a wave of unauthorised crossings last year by people seeking a haven from the pandemic.

The city has imposed home quarantine, exit restrictions and mass testing. By Saturday it had identified 3,650 close contacts and secondary contacts of cases, state media reported.

The other 19 new infections in mainland China were imported, the National Health Commission said.

The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 24 from 20.

Confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China now stand at 90,252, with the death toll unchanged at 4,636.

Florida bans 'vaccine passports'; California to allow indoor gatherings starting April 15; CDC travel guidance: Live COVID-19 updates,"The U.S. has vaccinated more than 30% of its population against COVID-19, with more than 101.8 million Americans receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine tracker. More than 17% of the total population has been fully vaccinated, as have more than 53% of those 65 and older.

Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson has begun vaccinating participants between 12 and 17 years old in its ongoing clinical trial for its COVID-19 vaccine, according to a company statement Friday.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on adolescents, not just with the complications of the disease, but with their education mental health, and wellbeing,” said Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson. “It is vital that we develop vaccines for everyone, everywhere, to help combat the spread of the virus with the goal to return to everyday life.”

The news follows the release of a Pfizer study that found its COVID-19 vaccine with German partner BioNTech was proven safe and effective for kids ages 12 to 15. The company also announced beginning trials in children under 12 years old.

In a separate company study, researchers found volunteers remained more than 90% protected against symptomatic COVID-19 and even better protected against severe disease six months after getting a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It also protects against the P.1 variant, first identified in Brazil.

Also in the news:

►Colorado will no longer require masks to be worn in most settings in the 31 counties that are on the lowest level of the state's COVID-19 dial system, Gov. Jared Polis' office announced Friday.

►The coronavirus variant discovered in California triggered a less effective immune response from the vaccine, a study published Thursday said.

►Michigan, where COVID-19 is surging more than in any state, on Thursday reported its first confirmed case of a coronavirus variant that was initially identified in Brazil.

Story continues

►Nevada lawmakers are considering sending mail-in ballots to all active voters in future elections after passing a law last summer that directed election officials to do so to prevent the coronavirus from spreading at polling places.

►British regulators identified 30 blood clot events from people who received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which is 25 more cases than previously reported on March 18, according to a statement from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency on Thursday.

📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has more than 30.6 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 553,900 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The global totals: 129.9 million cases and 2.83 million deaths. More than 200.49 million vaccine doses have been distributed in the U.S. and 153.63 million have been administered, according to the CDC.

CDC announces next steps to getting cruise ships back in US waters

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued the next phase of its Framework for Conditional Sailing Order, the guidance that will lead to getting cruise ships sailing again in U.S. waters.

The initial conditional sailing order came out in late October, and cruise operators have since been waiting for further guidance. In an announcement late Friday, the CDC said the second phase of the order will include trial voyages to practice new COVID-19 operational procedures with volunteers before sailing with paying passengers.

The CDC update, described in a news release as ""technical guidance,"" also includes a requirement to increase cruise COVID-19 reporting frequency to daily. There was no clarity in the guidance, however, about when cruise ships can start sailing again in U.S. waters.

California to allow indoor gatherings beginning April 15

California will allow indoor concerts, theater performances and other private gatherings starting April 15.

The California Department of Public Health announced the changes Friday as the rate of people testing positive for the virus nears a record low. It's a sharp turnaround from the slow pace California has taken on lifting restrictions, and comes as Gov. Gavin Newsom urges continued vigilance about wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.

To attend, people will have to either be tested or show proof of full vaccination. How many people can attend gatherings will depend on the level of restrictions in place at each county. California divides counties into four tiers based on how widespread the virus is in those places.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signs order banning 'vaccine passports'

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order Friday, effectively immediately, that bans businesses from requiring customers to show proof they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to get service.

The Republican governor had previously announced his intent to issue an order banning so-called “vaccine passports.” His action also barred any government agency in Florida from issuing such documentation for the purpose of providing proof of vaccinations.

In his executive order, DeSantis asserts that “vaccination passports reduce individual freedom and will harm patient privacy.”

CDC says fully vaccinated Americans can resume travel

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can resume travel at low risk to themselves, but the agency is still not recommending travel given rising case counts.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, who earlier this week issued an urgent plea to limit travel due to fears of another COVID surge, said Friday the new guidance is based on studies showing the ""real-world'' effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

Vaccinated travelers no longer have to follow the CDC's recommendations to get a COVID-19 test before and after travel unless required by the destination. They still need to wear masks and take other precautions.

For international travel, vaccinated passengers still must abide by a CDC order, issued in January, requiring a negative COVID test to board flights to the United States, and should get another test three to five days after arriving.

Despite the new guidance, Walensky said during a White House briefing that the CDC is not reversing its advice to avoid nonessential travel during the pandemic, vaccinated or unvaccinated

Asked how that squares with the announcement that vaccinated Americans can safely travel, she said: ""Our guidance is silent on recommending or not recommending fully vaccinated people travel,'' she said. ""Our guidance speaks to the safety of doing so. If you are vaccinated, it is lower risk.''

FDA permits changes to Moderna’s vaccine, allowing for more doses per vial

Moderna can put 50% more vaccine dosage in each vial, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday.

The company has been manufacturing 10 dose vials, but the FDA's decision allows the company to put up to 15 doses in each vial, a move that allows Moderna to speed up shipments and get more shots in arms.

The FDA is also allowing 11 doses to be extracted out of current 10 dose vials.

“Both of these revisions positively impact the supply of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, which will help provide more vaccine doses to communities and allow shots to get into arms more quickly. Ultimately, more vaccines getting to the public in a timely manner should help bring an end to the pandemic more rapidly,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

Florida’s pop-up COVID vaccine clinics raise ethical concerns

When Florida threw open the door for seniors to get COVID-19 vaccines, hundreds camped out overnight, some bundled up in lawn chairs in the January cold to score a shot.

Thousands more waited in digital lines for their number to come up in county-run vaccine pools. But for some lucky Floridians, getting a vaccine was as easy as hopping in their golf carts and rolling down to the clubhouse.

A USA TODAY Network analysis of state and local government records, news reports and information from private developers found at least 150 communities that landed vaccine pop-ups or priority access to doses. Data provided by the state is incomplete so there likely are many more. Read the full story.

'Health is everything': Tonya Lewis Lee opens up about why she prioritizes Black women's wellbeing,"No matter how busy Tonya Lewis Lee may get, she always makes sure she prioritizes self-care.

The wife, mother of two, philanthropist, author, producer and most recently, creator of Movita Organics says she's used to being on the go — but like many others, the pandemic forced her to slow down a bit and refocus on her health and overall wellness.

""To me, wellness and self-care starts with a half-hour of something every day. It can be yoga, it can be a run, it could be a bike ride. It can be just some sort of activity — it can be a walk, but just really doing something physical,"" Lee tells Yahoo Life.

Throughout Lee's personal health journey as a Black woman and a mother, she recognized the disparities in the health care industry very early on. So when she founded Movita Organics, a health and wellness platform aimed at making wellness more accessible to women of color from marginalized communities, one of her main objectives — outside of creating safe and healthy vitamin supplements for women — was to continue her advocacy for equality in women’s health and health care. One of her biggest areas of focus aimed at addressing the disparaging maternal mortality rate among women of color.

Currently, Black, American Indian and Alaska Native women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to the CDC. Lee hopes her activism and company can help close that gap.

""These issues are really about her social determinants of health,"" Lee explains. ""The numbers are dire and stark but there are good people out there trying to make change. We, as Black women, are recognizing our own power and are really learning how use it and to put it into motion.""

In order for change to take place, Lee says “what really needs to happen is people need to understand who [Black women] are. Demystify the Black woman.""

Freddie, who also goes by the name Richard Wheatley, enjoys an upper-crust existence, painting himself as a legitimate businessman. Even Sinatra seemed ready to rat his son out to Stabler—but unfortunately, Freddie got to him first and executed him on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Now, the chase is afoot. It seems likely that this case will consume a good portion of Organized Crime’s premiere season, or at least provide its early narrative backbone. But once the fog clears and the gavel inevitably falls, there will be time for other, longer-simmering questions—including, yes, whether after all these years, fans might finally get to see Benson and Stabler reconcile and, eventually, smooch. For now, however, we’ll have to wait and see.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"You can fly! You can fly! You can fly! CDC says vaccinated people can take to the skies again, but the agency is not saying you should do so","It’s OK for fully vaccinated people to travel domestically again without quarantining, so long as they wear a mask and maintain social distancing guidelines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced April 2, 2021 in its updated guidelines for travel.

The agency advises that people still wash or sanitize their hands frequently when traveling. The guidelines also provide guidance for other modes of transportation other than air travel, and are for domestic travel. The CDC recommends delaying international travel for fully vaccinated people.

The agency also advises delaying domestic travel for those who are not fully vaccinated. And, the updated travel guidance comes only days after CDC Director Rochelle Walensky reminded people that mask-wearing is still essential and that the U.S. is not out of danger.

Fully vaccinated means that two weeks have passed since people have received the full dose of vaccine. That is two shots for those who have been vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. For those who have been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, that is one shot. Studies have shown that it takes the body two weeks to develop the full immune response to the vaccine, regardless of which vaccine they receive.

More than 50 million people have been fully vaccinated, and more than 100 million people in the U.S. have had at least one dose of one of the three COVID-19 vaccines as of April 2, 2021. Evidence continues to show that vaccination with the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines offers very high levels of protection against the coronavirus. And, research is showing that the risk of vaccinated people spreading the disease to others is low. However, there is still a small risk that vaccinated people could transmit the disease to others.

While this is good news to those who want to travel – as well as the airline industry and tourist destinations – people are still confused about what they can and cannot safely do. As an infectious disease doctor, I’ve been fielding a lot of questions from my patients as well as my friends and family about what someone is allowed to do once vaccinated. Do vaccinated people need to wear masks, socially distance and avoid travel?

Story continues

If you are fully vaccinated – that is, if you are more than two weeks out from receiving both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson – you can visit other fully vaccinated people without socially distancing or wearing masks, according to the CDC guidelines. You can even visit indoors with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease without wearing masks or physically distancing.

The CDC does suggest you be tested if you develop symptoms that could be COVID-19. You should then stay isolated until you are shown to be uninfected. If you are fully vaccinated, you should still avoid social settings that include multiple unvaccinated households. And, you should avoid medium to large crowds because of the increased risk.

You also should continue to wear a well-fitted mask, wash your hands frequently and maintain physical distance when outside the home. Worshiping indoors at a synagogue, mosque or church is still not advisable unless all attending are vaccinated.

With regard to the new guidelines, the CDC says that vaccinated people should still monitor themselves before and after travel and wash or sanitize their hands frequently.

So in the face of continued pandemic transmission and new viral variants, we all need to remain vigilant and observe good health practices even after being vaccinated. However, it is very good news that we can prudently lift some of the restrictions that have so limited our ability to be with loved ones. This is especially good news for seniors who are particularly vulnerable to the downside of isolation – and the loved ones who are keen to visit them.

No Country for Any Men,"jenna wortham

Now, Wesley, you know I’m someone who doesn’t really believe in spoilers.

wesley morris

I just don’t understand it, but it’s a thing I’ve learned to love about you, yes.

jenna wortham

This is a controversial take. This is a controversial opinion. For most things, it just doesn’t really bother me if I know the outcome. It does not take away from my enjoyment. Actually, in some ways, it reduces my anxiety, especially when movies are high-paced or, thrillers. It just it calms me down to know what’s coming. That said, there are some exceptions to this rule. “Survivor” and “Drag Race.” I don’t want any GD spoilers.

wesley morris

[LAUGHING]

jenna wortham

We going to have some problems, OK? I’m talking Twitter, mostly.

wesley morris

All right.

jenna wortham

So this is all a run-up, all a preface to say that we’re going to do something we both deeply love to do on this podcast, which is dive so deep on a movie that we will have to spoil it. And that movie is the Oscar sugar baby “Promising Young Woman,” written and directed by Emerald Fennell.

wesley morris

Yes, it is nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, Best Actress for Carey Mulligan, who plays the promising young woman of the title — one of the promising young women of the title.

jenna wortham

And you and I cannot stop talking to each other about this movie, which is such a signal for us that we got to work it out in the room.

wesley morris

Yes.

jenna wortham

So just a heads up, look, this movie is dark. This movie is violent. It includes sexual violence. And we’re going to be talking through all of it. And we just want to prepare you for it because we love you and respect you, and only ever want you to have good feelings as you listen to the show. But we hope you’ll join us anyway because it’s going to be a really good conversation.

wesley morris

Yeah, you also do not have to have seen this movie to listen to it. We might even be having this conversation in lieu of your seeing the movie. I recommend you watch it because I think it’s worth watching, but we’re not going to spoil the movie, we’re going to enhance —

jenna wortham

Yes.

wesley morris

— your experience of it.

jenna wortham

Yes, that’s a good way to put it.

wesley morris

I’m Wesley Morris.

jenna wortham

I’m Jenna Wortham.

wesley morris

We are two culture writers for The New York Times.

jenna wortham

And this is Still Processing.

[music]

jenna wortham

The beginning of the movie. A bunch of scumbag dudes hanging out at a bar talking about scamming on girls.

archived recording (speaker 1) [INAUDIBLE] out to a strip club. archived recording (speaker 2) Which we can’t even do anymore. archived recording (speaker 1) Exactly. We can’t even —

wesley morris

Yeah, what you’re basically seeing is these suit guys. They’re like consultants or young middle manager types. And they spy on the other side of this bar this woman sort of sprawled out on a banquette, and she looks really in trouble.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

Her legs are kind of spread open a little bit.

jenna wortham

Her eyes are closed.

wesley morris

Yes, this woman is played by Carey Mulligan. She is trying to figure out what exactly is going on here. She’s just so out of it. She’s drunk or something.

jenna wortham

And she’s slumping over. She’s having a hard time staying upright. And these men, who are essentially portrayed as a pack of sharks, start figuring out who’s going to be the one to try to take her home.

archived recording (jerry) I’ll go over. archived recording (guys in suits) Oh.

jenna wortham

And so Adam Brody’s character says, I’m just going to go check on her.

archived recording (jerry) To see if she’s OK. archived recording (guys in suits) Yeah, no, of course.

jenna wortham

I think the way this movie opens, anyone who has ever gone out to a bar, ever participated in party culture, even happy hour culture, which is so deeply embedded with American work culture, remembers either themselves overindulging or seeing someone who’s overindulged. And it just brings up all these memories of moments when we’ve made not great decisions about our own consumption and overconsumption. So I feel my stomach knotting up when I’m watching this scene, and uncomfortable memories.

wesley morris

He’s asking if it’s OK for her to go back to his house for another drink.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

She’s already really hammered.

archived recording (cassandra) Do you live alone? archived recording (jerry) No, but my roommate’s out of town, so don’t worry.

jenna wortham

So anyway, now they’re kissing. And —

wesley morris

Well, no, no. He’s kissing her. She — her mouth isn’t doing anything. His mouth is doing everything, and her mouth is not moving at all.

jenna wortham

Right. So what we’re watching is someone really press up on the fringes of consent. She’s there. She’s not really awake. She’s not really upright. And this guy is totally taking advantage of the situation. And it feels really gross to watch.

archived recording (jerry) Oh, yeah.

wesley morris

So now they’re on his bed. And now he’s trying to undress her.

jenna wortham

He’s undressing her.

archived recording (jerry) Don’t go to sleep. archived recording (cassandra) [INAUDIBLE].

wesley morris

He’s pulled down her underwear.

archived recording (jerry) Gosh, you’re so pretty.

wesley morris

He’s between her legs.

jenna wortham

This is one of the most uncomfortable scenes of the movie.

archived recording (jerry) Hey, it’s OK. You’re safe. Shh. archived recording (cassandra) What are you doing?

wesley morris

What are you doing?

jenna wortham

And now the music heightens up. Her eyes open wide, clear as day. Homegirl is sober it turns out. She sits up, looks him dead in the face, and says, hey —

archived recording (cassandra) I said, what are you doing?

jenna wortham

Her clear-eyed sobriety is the scariest thing in the world to this man. And he looks up in horror. He’s like, what? And then we get to the title cards.

wesley morris

That is our opening salvo in this movie.

jenna wortham

But we realize that everything we’ve thought about her — all of our initial impressions of her — need to be reevaluated.

wesley morris

Right. And she goes home, she pulls out a notebook, and it’s filled with hundreds of tally marks. And so you realize Adam Brody in this first scene is just the umpteenth dude she has pulled this move on.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

You also understand that there is something just off about what we’re watching. This is this character’s entire life — targeting guys and obsessively marking them down. And you want to know where it’s going to go next.

jenna wortham

I love the scene where you see the notebook, because she’s in this traditional girly bedroom.

wesley morris

Her girlhood bedroom.

jenna wortham

Yeah, what appears to be her girlhood bedroom. It just becomes very evident and clear that Cassie’s plan to keep teaching these men a lesson — and I guess shocking them into sobriety — is the only thing she cares about. And I really love the subversiveness of the shot, because you just think — I love movies that tell you from the jump exactly what they’re going to be about. And this movie is no country for any man. Like, there’s just no redemption. Hashtag “all men.” You know, there’s a hashtag that’s like, not all men to be redemptive. And not all men are sexist, and rapists, and et cetera, et cetera. And this movie asks the question, well, what if all men, what if all men contain, and all people really do contain the germ, the seed, the possibility to be evil, harmful individuals, right? And this movie kind of raises the question, what if the world Cassie lives, there are no good men? And it’s such a fascinating thought.

wesley morris

Yeah, I feel like this works as a fairy tale. And we’re in a kind of once-upon-a-time realm. And within that fairy tale is this morality question about men and their behavior. And it’s a thriller, as we’re going to discover, with an actual thriller plot. In addition to its being a fairy tale, a morality play and a thriller, it is also just a romantic comedy from 1999 or 2004. And Cassie works in a coffee shop with her best pal, who’s played by Laverne Cox, and her boss, by the way. And in walks one day a person who recognizes Cassie.

jenna wortham

So in walks this dude named Ryan. And Ryan is a former med school classmate. But I also have to talk very quickly about what happens next because he’s trying to hit on her. She has no interest. She’s not trying to mess with him. She’s not trying to engage with him. And he kind of says jokingly, I don’t know, spit in my coffee. She does, hands the cup to him, and he drinks it. Now I don’t know why everybody is not talking about this scene. I was turned on. I was confused. I was horrified. I was aroused. I really was into it. And I also feel like maybe people know what to do with it, but I just — it felt like such a clear signal to me about the intimacies they’re going to share and that they have shared. And it’s kind of written off as this cheeky, strange — it’s supposed to be this insight, maybe, into how kind of DGAF this woman is. She just has nothing left to give for anybody, no effs to give for anybody. It’s an intimation of just the underbelly that she lives within.

wesley morris

I mean, the thing about that scene is it is also establishing — like, all of the sharp writing in this movie is between these two people. Their conversation is romantic comedy banter polished to a gleam. And Bo Burnham, by the way, is the actor who plays Ryan. And he is very good at just being a kind of perfect man in a romantic comedy sort of way. He’s a seemingly non-threatening good guy. That’s the thing he gives off. And in case you are doubting what a good guy he is, he’s not just any kind of doctor. He’s a surgeon for kids.

jenna wortham

He’s supposed to enter the movie as a foil to Cassie’s worldview that all men are terrible, all men are trash. He kind of functions to me is an N.P.C., like a non-playable character in a video game. He’s just like wallpaper.

wesley morris

But there’s something important about the introduction of this Ryan character. He has a really crucial plot point in his pocket that he needs to give to Cassie, which is that an old med school friend of theirs is back in town. And all these guys were in medical school together — Ryan, this guy Al, Cassie and her best friend, Nina. And when they were there at school together, Nina gets raped at a party while she’s drunk and nobody does anything about it. Law enforcement doesn’t do anything. The school doesn’t do anything. It just gets buried. And Nina is so traumatized that she drops out. And apparently, Cassie is an extra, extra good friend because she drops out of school to take care of Nina. And the trauma of all of this — the weight of the assault, the fact that nobody does anything about it — is too much for Nina, and she kills herself. And all of this is what sends Cassie off the deep end herself, and on this mission to lure guys in bars in order to shame them to get revenge, not on a specific man, but on the culture of misogyny that both facilitates these assaults, and then helps bury them once they come to light. And I think that what you’re supposed to glean from the scores and scores of completed tallies is that this is working in some way for her, right? Not working for her, but it is a form of cutting. It’s a form of bulimia. It is like a kind of self-harm. I think she’s trying to fill a hole whose depth she doesn’t know. But I also think that the way this movie works, it’s so tidy that, of course, I’m believing that this is in her mind a successful experiment in —

jenna wortham

Yes.

wesley morris

In therapy, right? Because the movie itself is so tidy, and not a hair is out of place, so to speak, in the way that it operates. The movie is a machine, and it is well-oiled.

jenna wortham

Yeah, I’m thinking on what you said about self-harm. I mean, she’s not really able to process in a way that we would consider healthy. She’s not able to have any kind of emotional sobriety, or healthy intimacy, or healthy coping mechanisms that she’s really invested in this interaction of manipulation and power dynamics. But I would also say that I think what we’re witnessing is a critique of how little tools there are. We don’t equip women with tools. We don’t equip people with tools of coping and figuring out how to navigate harm, and figuring out where to turn, and feeling supported as they try to deal with unspeakable harm. And for me watching it, it’s really commentary about a lack of infrastructure and support for women like Cassie and Nina who are suffering as survivors.

wesley morris

And so Cassie’s project changes at this point, because this old med school classmate who’s back in town — Al Monroe is his full name. He’s the guy that’s getting married, and he was the guy who also raped Nina. So Cassie goes from targeting these guys in bars, these random strangers in order to teach them a lesson, to targeting the people involved in Nina’s rape and in the cover-up of her rape, including the dean of this medical school, who’s played by —

jenna wortham

Mrs. Coach! F.N.L. forever. Go on.

wesley morris

Yes, Connie Britton is the med school dean. [DOOR CLOSES]

archived recording (dean walker) Daisy. archived recording (cassandra) That’s me. archived recording (dean walker) Dean Walker, please sit.

jenna wortham

She really has perfected that polished air of indifference of a school administrator who’s, like, totally unaware of the actual reality of the environment they’re lording over.

archived recording (cassandra) Maybe you remember Alexander Monroe? archived recording (dean walker) Oh, yes, Alexander Monroe. He actually just came back and gave a talk here.

wesley morris

The dean is like, oh, that guy, Al, he’s wonderful. He’s a really great guy.

archived recording (dean walker) Are you a friend of his? archived recording (cassandra) No. So you don’t remember the accusations made against Al Monroe?

jenna wortham

And so Cassie in this moment a girl is bringing up her friend Nina Fisher. And she’s asking the dean, do you remember this incident of reported sexual assault where several men, several of these students —

archived recording (cassandra) Too drunk to have any idea what was going on.

jenna wortham

— raped and attacked my friend. And she reported it. And the dean’s like, oh, my God. Well, who presided over the case?

archived recording (cassandra) You. You felt there wasn’t sufficient evidence. You said it was too much of a he said, she said situation. archived recording (dean walker) Well, we get accusations like this all the time. One or two a week.

wesley morris

We bury these all the time!

archived recording (dean walker) Yes, I mean, because what would you have me do? Ruin a young man’s life every time we get an accusation like this?

jenna wortham

This language is really upsetting because the language privileges the experience of the men over the women.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

Why is there so much support for men like Al Monroe, and not any support for Nina Fisher, who actually is dead.

archived recording (cassandra) I guess you did the right thing. We have to give these boys the benefit of the doubt. That’s why I know you won’t mind, but three hours ago, I picked your daughter Amber up from school and introduced her to the boys who live in that room now. archived recording (dean walker) What?

jenna wortham

So here we’re starting to see how much of a sociopath Cassie is. And this is the part I love the most of this movie for that reason.

wesley morris

This is your favorite scene?

archived recording (cassandra) But I’m sure they’ll take good care of your daughter.

jenna wortham

Yeah, because Cassie is going to lay out the way that she’s going to enact revenge on the dean, right? She’s going to use her own flawed logic against her.

archived recording (cassandra) She is really pretty, huh? She looks a lot older than she is. archived recording (dean walker) I don’t believe you. archived recording (cassandra) I noticed they had a few bottles of vodka in the room, too. But I’m sure they’ll take good care of your daughter. She seemed excited, actually.

wesley morris

Once the dean finds out that Cassie has potentially done something horrible to her daughter —

archived recording [PHONE VIBRATING]

wesley morris

— the power dynamic totally shifts.

archived recording (dean walker) She’s a young girl. archived recording (cassandra) I wonder if she looks so young to those guys.

wesley morris

And the dean is suddenly frazzled and afraid.

archived recording (dean walker) Tell me what [EXPLETIVE] room she’s in. Now!

wesley morris

And, by the way, the music starts to come up. The horror music in this movie — there’s two music modes.

jenna wortham

It’s so good.

wesley morris

Music mode number one is soundtrack — mostly pop song soundtrack. And this deep, dark, horror-oriented music.

jenna wortham

It’s also exposing the way society considers some people expendable and others not, right? The dean is deeply concerned about her daughter, even if she’s not super concerned about Cassie or Nina. And she’s exposing the thinness of her logic. And it’s just so delicious. I know we don’t talk about Quentin Tarantino in this house, but it’s so Uma Thurman in the yellow tracksuit showing up with a samurai sword whisking the blood off of it, just ready. Just like, no, I’m here. You are going to deal with me.

wesley morris

That’s a very interesting person to pick because the first person that comes to mind for me is any Glenn Close character from the years 1985 to 1988 or 1990.

jenna wortham

The rabbit in the pot, really? “Fatal Attraction“? Is that where you’re going to go?

wesley morris

Yes, this is a high-minded, inverse morality play on the kind of vengeance that a person like Glenn Close in “Fatal Attraction” takes on Michael Douglas, right? She shows up at Michael Douglas’s apartment. When he gets home, she’s there and talking to his wife and his daughters in the house.

jenna wortham

So good.

wesley morris

What you see when Glenn Close enters Michael Douglas’s domestic life, his marriage, essentially, is we’re meant to understand that this woman is falling apart in a way. And what “Promising Young Woman” does is an inverse of that, which is we already know this woman is falling apart. We are watching her build that collapse into a thriller narrative, essentially, that is entirely predicated upon getting revenge for her and her friend.

jenna wortham

I think what I really find to be so fascinating is that the movie is showing us what happens in a community when you won’t acknowledge the violence, and you won’t acknowledge the harm. And I like thinking about community accountability, right? The scene is really about the failure of the institution to protect women — to protect Nina, to protect Cassie, to not follow up and to have no procedures. And it’s also about the feelings, the ways in which the shortcomings of, quote, a criminal justice system or a carceral justice framework fail the people who are supposed to benefit from them, right? Even if this guy, Al Monroe, had been punished, it would still be insufficient because there’s no — Nina’s still dead, right? Nina’s still been attacked. But it also speaks to the ways in which this community in particular did not wrap around these women. Since last year, I’ve become really invested in reading up on restorative justice and transformational justice practices. And one of the organizations that I’ve been following and paying attention to is the Audre Lord Project. And they talk so much about how attention to moments of violence, especially gendered violence, and these ruptures in community that are caused by harm. They have to be healed in collective action. They have to be healed together. And what we’re witnessing is someone who’s been so ostracized by this event that nobody wants to talk about, or take accountability for, or even acknowledge that she’s essentially already dead. And Cassie has sort of been pushed to the margins of this community and this society. And what’s actually happened is they’ve committed a kind of social murder. And one of the things that’s not talked enough about for survivors of assault and abuse is the social death they experience, and the ways in which they become persona non grata, because nobody knows how to deal with this. We’re not equipped with the tools. It makes them feel so uncomfortable, and so they’d rather not deal with it. And people just kind of get excommunicated, they get pushed out even farther. And I do think that’s what the movie gets right about how isolating these incidents are. And one of the things I think this movie is really good at capturing is that there actually are many ways to die.

[music]

wesley morris

So we’re going to take a break right now. And when we come back, we’re going to talk about the ways in which “Promising Young Woman” is part of a family of movies that feel like justice has to be served to make us feel good about having gone to the movies to watch injustice.

jenna wortham

So now we’re in the third act of the movie, which is not the final act. Although, you think it might be, but it’s not. It’s the third act of the movie. And now we’re getting a sense of just how far Cassie is willing to go to put the final touches, the finishing acts on this revenge fantasy. We see her going into Al Monroe’s bachelor party. And he is the guy who sexually assaulted her friend, Nina. So I just want to say this again. This is when the movie really takes a turn. It gets really bleak. It gets really violent, very disturbing. And we are going to talk about it for the remainder of the episode. So prepare yourself.

[music - funereal version of ""toxic"" by britney spears]

wesley morris

And this scene opens with the most funereal version of Britney Spears’ “Toxic.”

jenna wortham

I would also classify this as horrorcore. It is so disturbing. It’s not a song to dance to. It’s a song to disembowel somebody to. It’s very, very ominous. She drives her car and parks it, and you realize that she’s on a mission. She’s always on a mission, but you realize that this mission has a different layer to it because when she gets out of the car, she takes off the back license plate. She doesn’t want anybody to be able to identify the plate. So that already tells you she’s engaging in a different way then she has been in the past. The tone is really dark. The mood is really stormy. It’s very ominous. Nothing good is going to happen in this house.

wesley morris

This little sequence right here, I got horror thriller, horror movie chills. So she’s going to make her entrance into this bachelor party.

archived recording (partygoer) Oh, the doctor’s here. [MEN CHEERING]

jenna wortham

The door opens. No one questions the arrival of this woman who is presumed to be a stripper, a dancer, a performer of some sort. No one is really questioning why she’s there. No one can figure out who hired her, but it’s very much ingrained in the culture that this is the type of person who would appear at this party, so they just accept it.

wesley morris

Yeah.

jenna wortham

She’s dressed in a nurse’s costume — a white nurse’s costume with the thick white tights and these red stiletto heels. And she’s wearing this cotton candy colored short wig. She looks like kind of like a Juggalo, kind of like Harley Quinn.

wesley morris

She looks like Britney Spears.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

She looks like Britney Spears as Harley Quinn.

jenna wortham

And then I kind of love the scene that follows, which is she takes a bottle of warm vodka, which is its own kind of hell, and puts a pour spigot in it. And then it just shows those men just lining up with their mouths open, and she’s just splashing alcohol all over them. And she’s also doing her own a little bit of a striptease. But it’s kind of more about their raw willingness. And in my mind, just how disgusting they are, and how much in control she is in this moment. I kept trying to remember what imagery wanted to surface and what this woman, this sexy woman in a nurse costume was reminiscent of for me. And I finally figured it out a few days ago.

wesley morris

OK.

jenna wortham

It is 100 percent Janine Lindemulder. Do you remember who that is?

wesley morris

No.

jenna wortham

The super, super sexy nurse on the cover of that Blink 182 album and in that video “What’s My Age Again?” Remember that?

wesley morris

Yes.

jenna wortham

Talk about generation-defining. That video came out in 1999. And Janine is also a porn star. And there is something really amazing about seeing this sex worker on MTV and this kind of mainstream embrace. And it felt like the embodiment of that late ‘90s super pro-woman, super feminist, pro-sex sex positive, all of that energy that consumed that decade for me. But and obviously as I’ve gotten older, I reflected on it, and I think there was an inherent tension between how much women were allowed to actually have agency over their sex and their sexuality, and how much the culture kind of pushed back, and how much hostility there was towards women that embraced their sexuality. And it kind of took that as a prompt to really dump on them and let women be as sexy as they want to be, but we’re still going to confine them to our own misogynistic fantasies. We’re still going to reduce them sexually. We’re still going to treat them like shit because, whatever, they’re telling us we can. There was this conflation by male culture that women who were sexually open, and sexually forward — and sex positive, frankly — could be mistreated because of that openness of their sexuality. And I feel so much of that in this scene.

wesley morris

And she takes the bachelor up to the room.

archived recording (cassandra) Look, I don’t have to do anything if you don’t want me to, but I only get paid if I go upstairs with you. archived recording (al monroe) OK.

wesley morris

He really doesn’t want to go, which is really another reversal where he’s sort of encouraged, egged on to go, but really doesn’t want to.

archived recording (al monroe) So what do I — archived recording (cassandra) Get on the bed.

And he’s like, this is a joke. I want to get out of here. He’s not comfortable.

jenna wortham

And he starts to call for help. And she’s like, all your friends downstairs, they’re passed out. And so she’s roofied all the guys downstairs with this bottle of — she is also the toxic element in this house. So it’s so full circle to me.

wesley morris

Right. Yeah, again, just utter tidiness. So, interestingly, she keeps the costume on for all of this. But is it a costume? Is it a disguise? I mean, one thing you and I have not talked about, really, because we’ve compared this movie to so many other types of movies and so many genres, but what this really is is a superhero movie, right? This is the story of a regular person who has a horrible thing happen to them, and the expression of that horrible thing in day-to-day life is as this alter ego. It becomes this other personality. And in this case, this person is like an Avenger, so to speak. And part of that avenging job is to bring justice to Cassandra and to Nina, her friend. And there are costumes involved. And now here she is at the climax getting her arch enemy, this guy Al Monroe.

archived recording (cassandra) Really, don’t [EXPLETIVE] cry. Tell me what you did. archived recording (al monroe) I didn’t do anything wrong, though.

wesley morris

What does he think was right about what he did?

archived recording (al monroe) I was affected by it, too OK? It’s every guy’s worst nightmare getting accused like that. [LAUGHTER]

jenna wortham

Oh, my god.

wesley morris

That’s not my favorite line in the movie, but he’s writhing, and kicking, and pulling his arms trying to pull himself loose from the bedpost. Now is her chance.

archived recording (cassandra) I wanted to be a doctor my whole life. But lately, I’ve been feeling like I might want to get back into it.

wesley morris

This is the moment we see her use some medical training to actually perform a little surgery potentially on this dude. She wants to carve Nina’s name onto his body.

archived recording (al monroe) Help me!

jenna wortham

And as she starts to carve into his leg, he breaks free from the handcuffs and things start to go horribly wrong. And this is the fourth act of the movie. This is the beginning of the fourth act of the movie when you see how far this guy’s willing to go to keep his reputation intact, how they view her disposability. And he puts the pillow over her face, and just starts screaming, shut up. And I remember feeling disbelief when I started watching this scene. They’re not really going to kill her, are they? And they do.

wesley morris

So you get to this scene. There’s all this work done to build up to this moment. To the extent that anything is earned in this movie, I feel like this climax is earned because the mounting tension in this entire movie.

jenna wortham

Right. The most powerful thing and difficult thing about this movie is that it really gives the amount of time. It actually shows you in a visceral way what it would take to kill someone, right? She’s fighting, she won’t stop. A lot of our popular culture and entertainment, they don’t really deal with the actual violence they’re showing. You don’t always see blood. People just get shot and they fall down, or somebody gets their neck sliced and they fall down, or a woman gets killed and it takes two seconds of a three-hour movie. This movie devotes a significant amount of time to the suffocation of this woman. And I think it’s meant to really portray he’s not changing his mind. He is intent on obliterating, destroying —

wesley morris

This is non-negotiable.

jenna wortham

— this body and this person. Yeah, it is a non-negotiable death.

wesley morris

The thing that came to mind while I watched it — and this is a wild thing to say, Jenna, but like I did think about George Floyd. I thought about George Floyd’s death. I thought about the video of his death and the way that affected people. And the fact that you were seeing a living person lose his life without interruption, it’s just a haunting thing that you never forget.

jenna wortham

I think this scene is the fulcrum for me. My excitement about this movie cooled with this scene. And I think it’s really strange to watch a movie about femicide perpetuate that very same thing. And I found it to be so unsettling. And, look, I’m not a filmmaker, but I just think there — I wonder if the point could have been made another way.

wesley morris

Yeah.

jenna wortham

I just don’t know that a piece of activism about gender violence needs to sacrifice a woman to make the point. The satisfaction at different points that I enjoy throughout the movie are completely devoid in this moment and in this decision, and, frankly, for the rest of the film after this point. There’s just no possibility for redemption of this character, Al Monroe. He is so invested in himself and his livelihood and his reputation that he’s willing to essentially kill another person to preserve himself and save himself. And he can do it with the knowledge that the culture will support him. The culture will rebound around him. Presumably, he thinks the same thing that kept him from being accountable for Nina’s rape is going to keep him from being accountable from this murder.

wesley morris

Yes. And all the stuff that you’re saying about Al is realized the next morning.

archived recording It was an accident. archived recording (al monroe) Of course it was a [EXPLETIVE] accident. archived recording Yeah, of course it was a [EXPLETIVE] accident. No one’s going to go to jail because no one’s ever going to find out.

wesley morris

Al, with the help of his best friend — the best friend is doing all the motivating. And they burn her body. They stand over this pyre, basically, of her burning body. And then this MF goes and gets married, and everybody’s there. Ryan even shows up. And during the reception, you hear police sirens. And you know they’re coming for Al. And Cassie has basically orchestrated this whole thing. All this evidence for the police to find to make sure these dudes would be arrested for what happened to Nina, and obviously to her. And just to be sure Ryan knew what she did, she scheduled text messages to him. The phone actually says “scheduled message.” I didn’t even know phones do that. What year is this? But the texts are basically like, “Enjoy the wedding, sweetie, love Cassie and Nina. Emoji.” To me, what that felt like was the hand beyond the grave that happens in many a horror movie and many a thriller. There’s a moment in “Fatal Attraction” where you think Glenn Close is dead after Michael Douglas chokes her in the bathtub, then she pops up with the knife and, oh! Anne Archer, Michael Douglas’s wife, shoots her. And now she’s really dead. And what happens at the end of “Promising Young Woman” is basically a version of that. It is a hand punching up out of the grave that is essentially, in the case of this movie, meant to restore order and bring justice. And we hear the sirens, and we’re supposed to know that this is over. The cops are going to take these dudes away and arrest them. And all of these dudes who did this horrible thing to her friend Nina, and to her — soon they’ll find that out, too — they’re all going down.

jenna wortham

Right. And so when we’re watching the wedding and we’re watching these dudes in their khaki colored suits, and these elaborate cheese spreads, and floral crowns, and this bougie outdoor setting, you hear the siren of the police. And it’s supposed to fill the viewers with this relief. It does. It works. You’re like, oh, my god. Thank god, right? There’s one side of me that’s like experiencing that relief of, quote, help. And then there’s the other part of me that’s much larger and much more sentient aware that’s like, the police? What are the police going to do? The police ain’t shit. And I was like, well, that’s also how you know this movie is made by white people, because I don’t know anybody who hears the arrival of police sirens and experiences the feeling of relief. But the idea that somehow this is the solution to all the problems, and this is the thing, it’s like, again, for all the ways the movie is thinking beyond the box and thinking in these really inventive, new, strange ways, it’s still — it settles on a solution that is so disappointing and so unsatisfactory. And it works as a movie. But I think, yeah, as you were saying, it was like a morality fable. It’s really disappointing because that’s just not a solution. And the solution cannot involve carnage and casualties and half burnt bodies.

wesley morris

Right. Yeah.

jenna wortham

Who’s to say that if these guys go to jail, they won’t be able to hire lawyers that get them off? They are supported and protected by an infrastructure that over and over and over again, even throughout the course of this movie, has shown up, and protected them, and kept them out of harm’s way. So why are we meant to believe now, in this final act of the film, that justice has been served?

wesley morris

Well, I keep coming back to this word tidy, right? We are a culture that really, really likes happy endings. We want to know that we got our money’s worth. And the way we know we got it is that we leave the theater not just emotionally happy, but with a sense of closure. With the sense of closure that a movie can provide that most victims of sexual assault never receive.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

Right?

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

And so this movie is kind of operating at cross purposes in some ways, right? And the movie wants to be the justice while also acknowledging the appalling lack of it, right? The fact that by the end of the movie, you still have two dead women who are dead because of a culture of sexual assault. So the other movie that came up while I was watching “Promising Young Woman” again is “Thelma & Louise.” That movie is essentially the story of a rape survivor, and, perhaps, the survivor of more than a rape. And she tries to go away for the weekend with her best friend, Thelma. And on the first night of this little mini vacation, Thelma is almost raped. And so Louise, who is the rape survivor, shoots the guy dead. Just kills him. And the two of them spend the rest of the movie on the run, but also discover that being on this journey has kind of transformed them into these powerful, badass outlaw justice warriors. And that movie, too, ends in a kind of clash of sirens and free will, and this question of, what is justice going to look like for the two of us?

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

Rather than surrender to Harvey Keitel, who is the exponent of the Arkansas state police or the F.B.I., they decide, you know what? We had it real good. And whatever we’re about to turn around and go surrender ourselves to is going to be a whole hell of a lot worse than driving this Thunderbird off a cliff. So what do they do? They drive the car off a cliff. And while they do it, their hands are clasped. They give each other a big kiss before they drive. And the shot of the car flying into the canyon is freeze framed, and there’s a fade to white, and the credits roll.

jenna wortham

Yes. And as the unofficial president of the Susan Sarandon and Gina Davis fan club, I was way too young to see that movie when it came out, but I’ve since watched it several times over the last couple of years. And, yes, they do share some lineage and there is some D.N.A. in there, but the ending of “Thelma & Louise” is satisfying, even though you kind of assume they die because they drive off of a cliff. But the film doesn’t show it. The film in that freeze frame offers a futurity that we can’t imagine, or we can’t see. And you sort of have to trust their vision for it. And I just think in “Promising Young Woman,” the directorial choices don’t allow you such an easy escape, which I guess is the point. But in “Thelma & Louise,” there’s something really incredible about these two women having gone through this traumatic experience together and deciding how they’re going to exit it together. They don’t rely on the police. They choose something else. They choose something transformative. And even if that thing ends up being death, which we don’t really know, it still feels more at their hands versus at the hands of the state or any more bad men.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

And “Promising Young Woman” only assumes the outcome is death and jail. You and I are really trying to take stock of a post-2020 landscape. And we’re trying to take stock of a moment in time when we have challenged our assumptions about the world we live in and the institutions, and really aggressively acknowledging that the status quo does not work. And “Promising Young Woman” still relies on the status quo. There’s just no nuance and outcome for these women, for these men. And “Thelma & Louise” is a great movie to bring in as a companion. People should watch that alongside this movie as well. And if they have the stomach for it, watch “I May Destroy You,” which is Michaela Coel’s show that aired on HBO last year as well about a woman surviving the aftermath of sexual assault. And similarly, it is unsparing about the sheer violence that happens when someone crosses a line, right? When someone crosses a boundary and when assaults happen. But the difference between a show like “I May Destroy You” is that Michaela Coel’s character was able to start walking towards healing, and start walking towards a resolution that did not enact any more violence or harm on her precious body. And I think for a show that really disturbed me in the same way that “Promising Young Woman” disturbed me — I had to take breaks, I had to take pauses. But I felt like I was watching an artist, and I was watching a very angry young woman figure out more violence is not the answer. And I’ve become really invested in transformative justice. And there’s a great post outlining what T.J. is by Mia Mingus, who’s a disability justice advocate and a T.J, worker that lays out what it actually means to seek justice while still reducing harm, right? And, actually, if you think about it, that’s such a radical idea.

wesley morris

Yeah.

jenna wortham

So much of American popular culture and film and TV is a fantasy that the police will save us. And those quintessential sirens that you hear at the end of “Promising Young Woman,” that’s something that’s been used over and over and over again to signal that the police equal safety. And this year is one of the years that we really are having a national conversation about how untrue that is for so many of us, including white women. It’s not just the most oppressed. It’s actually true. And I think that’s why we’re seeing these incredible protests right now happening in the U.K. over the killing of Sarah Everett, who was killed by a police officer, right? That narrative is being reinforced, and people are actually talking about it, again, at this international level, which is really incredible. And maybe that’s why “Promising Young Woman” feels so disappointing to me, because it just — it acts like the state is the solution when we’re coming into such a deeper knowing of how they perpetuate all the problems. And what we see happening in “I May Destroy You” is an examination of the conditions that led to that violence. And her active participation and disrupting that cycle shows us an outlet for ending it, right? And in the process, we see an outcome for this very promising young woman that does not involve death.

From the makers of Serial: The Improvement Association. In this five-part audio series, join the reporter Zoe Chace as she travels to Bladen County, N.C., to investigate the power of election fraud allegations — even when they’re not substantiated.

A few years ago, Bladen County, N.C., made national headlines. In 2018, Mark Harris, a Republican, beat out his Democratic opponent for a congressional seat, but the election was later thrown out and a new election was called after his campaign was investigated over suspicions of absentee-ballot fraud.

But according to some local residents, the authorities got it all wrong. They say there’s a powerful group still at work in the county, tampering with elections, bullying voters and stealing votes — a Black advocacy group, the Bladen County Improvement Association. These accusations have never been substantiated, but they persist.

Join Zoe Chace as she travels to Bladen County to find out what’s behind all this suspicion. Who exactly is making the accusations? And in small-town politics, where rumors and allegations abound, how can you be sure who is telling the truth?",2021-03-30 00:00:00
"Virus Variants Threaten to Draw Out the Pandemic, Scientists Say","Instead of a new vaccine against variants, however, it may be just as effective for Americans to receive a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna vaccines in six months to a year, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

That would keep antibody levels high in each recipient, overwhelming any variant — a more practical strategy than making a specialized vaccine for each new variant that emerges, he said.

“My only concern about chasing all the variants is that you’d almost be playing Whac-A-Mole, you know, because they’ll keep coming up and keep coming up,” Dr. Fauci said.

In one form or another, the new coronavirus is here to stay, many scientists believe. Multiple variants may be circulating in the country at the same time, as is the case for common cold coronaviruses and influenza. Keeping them at bay may require an annual shot, like the flu vaccine.

The best way to deter the emergence of dangerous variants is to keep cases down now and to immunize the vast majority of the world — not just the United States — as quickly as possible. If significant pockets of the globe remain unprotected, the virus will continue to evolve in dangerous new ways.

“This might be something that we have to deal with for a long time,” said Rosalind Eggo, an epidemiologist at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Still, she added, “Even if it changes again, which it is very likely to do, we are in a better, much stronger position than a year ago to deal with it.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Fatigue Outpaces Progress as France Enters Yet Another Lockdown,"PARIS — At the Montparnasse train station in Paris, the contrast couldn’t have been sharper.

About a year ago, faced with the first national lockdown against a raging coronavirus epidemic, Parisians desperately jammed into trains in an exodus that turned Montparnasse into a place of fear and anxiety, and the capital into a ghost town.

But on Friday morning, a day before the start of the third national lockdown, foot traffic was relatively light inside Montparnasse station and others in Paris. The mood was one of deep fatigue ahead of restrictions that, once again, will severely limit travel across France, confine people’s movements in their communities and shut down schools.

“There is a bit of weariness,” said Muriel Sallandre, who was catching a train to visit her parents in western France but planned to return to Paris in a few days. “The absence of perspective, being dependent on the government’s messages — all that is ultimately a little depressing.”

Many French people rushed to buy train tickets immediately after the announcement of a new lockdown on Wednesday evening. So the capital’s stations will likely get more crowded over the weekend as travelers planning to spend the latest lockdown outside Paris mix with those traveling to visit relatives for Easter. Some Parisians also left the capital after restrictions were imposed in the capital region a couple of weeks ago.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Returning to the Office Sparks Anxiety and Dread for Some,"Plenty of people are eager to return to the office, especially younger workers who feel they have more to lose by being away.

Sheeta Verma, 21, a recent graduate, was hired early last year before the pandemic shut down the offices of her tech firm Neurable, based in Boston.

“Being the youngest in the office, I don’t get to connect with my colleagues and it’s important that I connect, to get to know them, understand their mind set, how they learn and how they grew their careers,” Ms. Verma said.

Yet, even Ms. Verma wants her employer, who hasn’t yet set a date for a broad return of employees to the office, to let her work from home some of the time, a hope shared by experienced workers like Deborah Paredes, who works at the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia.

Ms. Paredes commuted one hour each way from her home in Palmyra, N.J., to her desk before the pandemic. She is not interested in resuming that trek daily.

Some of Ms. Paredes’s concerns are about her health. She has had both Covid-19 vaccine shots, but has asthma and an autoimmune disorder. “I don’t fancy being packed into an elevator with all of the people and the trains. It just seems silly,” Ms. Paredes, 59, said. “Who decided we needed to leave our homes and go to an office to work?”

Ms. Paredes also believes she got a lot more done working at home. A self-described introvert who is easily distracted, she liked working at her own pace without standard office interruptions. “I can wake up, go for a jog and be working by 8:30 and sometimes I’ve worked until 10 at night and I don’t feel resentful about that because I’m on a roll,” she said. “But there’s no way I could have been in the office until 10 p.m. working.”",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"Covid-19 Live Updates: Under Pressure From Governors, More U.S. Schools Reopen","Live Covid-19 Live Updates: Under Pressure From Governors, More U.S. Schools Reopen Both Republican and Democratic governors are acting to overcome union resistance and bureaucratic hesitancy. Citing fear of counterfeit vaccines, Kenya halts the private importation of doses. RIGHT NOW More than 3 million people are now receiving a Covid vaccine in the U.S. each day.

A bipartisan group of governors is making a big push to reopen U.S. schools. Students at the Green Mountain School in Woodland, Wash., completing a health screening before entering on Feb. 18. Credit... Nathan Howard/Getty Images In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine offered school districts early access to vaccines for their staff if they committed to opening classrooms by March 1. In Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency related to child and adolescent mental health and banned fully virtual instruction starting in April. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker announced that most elementary schools would be required to offer full-time in-person instruction by April 5, and most middle schools by April 28. The three are part of a significant and bipartisan group of governors who have decided it is time to flex some muscle and get students back into classrooms, despite union resistance and bureaucratic hesitancy. The push has come from both ends of the political spectrum. Democratic governors in Oregon, California, New Mexico and North Carolina, and Republicans in Arizona, Iowa, West Virginia and New Hampshire, among other states, have all taken steps to prod, and sometimes force, districts to open. The result has been a major increase in the number of students who now have the option of attending school in-person, or will in the next month. According to a school reopening tracker created by the American Enterprise Institute, 7 percent of the more than 8,000 districts being tracked were operating fully remotely on March 22, the lowest percentage since the tracker was started in November. Forty-one percent of districts were offering full-time in-person instruction, the highest percentage in that time. Those findings have been echoed by other surveys. In interviews, several governors described the factors motivating their decision to push districts to reopen, including the substantial evidence that there is little virus transmission in schools if mitigation measures are followed, the decline in overall cases from their January peak, and, most of all, the urgency of getting students back in classrooms before the school year ends. “Every day is an eternity for a young person,” Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said. “We just could not wait any further.” In the weeks since most of the governors acted, nationwide cases have started to rise again, which could complicate the effort to get children back in school. Many school staff members have already been offered vaccines, which has reduced the resistance from teachers’ unions to reopening and, provided staff vaccination rates are high, will limit the opportunities for the virus to spread in schools. Even so, in areas where cases are increasing sharply, like Michigan, some schools have had to revert to remote learning temporarily because so many students were in quarantine. But for the time being, at least, the moves by these governors have yielded significant results. In Ohio, nearly half of all students were in districts that were fully remote at the beginning of 2021. By March 1, that number was down to 4 percent, and it has shrunk further in the weeks since. In Washington, before Mr. Inslee issued his proclamation, the state’s largest district, Seattle Public Schools, was locked in a standoff with its teachers’ union over a reopening plan. Days after Mr. Inslee announced he would require districts to bring students back at least part time, the two sides reached an agreement for all preschool and elementary school students and some older students with disabilities to return by April 5. And in Massachusetts, the move by Mr. Baker, a Republican, has spurred a sea change, with dozens of districts bringing students back to school for the first time since the pandemic began, and hundreds shifting from part-time to full-time schedules. “It’s worked exceedingly well,” Mr. DeWine, also a Republican, said of his decision to offer vaccines to Ohio districts that pledged to reopen. “We’ve got these kids back in school.”

‘We have gained hope again’: Israel’s successful vaccine campaign makes crowds possible again during Holy Week. Christian worshipers at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, during a Good Friday procession in Jerusalem. Credit... Dan Balilty for The New York Times JERUSALEM — In the Old City of Jerusalem on Friday morning, in the alleys of the Christian quarter, it was as if the pandemic had never happened. The winding passageways that form the Via Dolorosa, along which Christians believe Jesus hauled his cross toward his crucifixion, were packed with over 1,000 worshipers. The Good Friday procession, where the faithful retrace the route Jesus is said to have taken, was back. “It is like a miracle,” said the Rev. Amjad Sabbara, a Roman Catholic priest who helped lead the procession. “We’re not doing this online. We’re seeing the people in front of us.” Pandemic restrictions forced the cancellation of last year’s ceremony and required priests to hold services without congregants present. Now, thanks to Israel’s world-leading vaccine rollout, religious life in Jerusalem is edging back to normal. And on Friday, that brought crowds back to the city’s streets, and relief to even one of Christianity’s most solemn commemorations: the Good Friday procession. For much of the past year, the pandemic kept the Old City eerily empty. But with nearly 60 percent of Israeli residents fully vaccinated, the city’s streets were once again thrumming, even if international tourists were still absent. At the gathering point for the procession on Friday, there was scarcely space to stand. The crowd moved slowly off, singing mournful hymns as they proceeded along what Christians consider a re-enactment of Jesus’ last steps. In the alley outside the chapel of St. Simon of Cyrene, the marchers trailed their fingers over an ocher limestone in the chapel wall. According to tradition, Jesus steadied himself against the stone after a stumble. Finally, they reached the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which believers think was the site of Christ’s crucifixion, burial and, ultimately, resurrection. For some, the Good Friday procession carried even more resonance than usual — its themes of suffering, redemption and renewal seeming particularly symbolic as the end of a deadly pandemic appeared finally in sight. “We have gained hope again,” said George Halis, 24, who is studying to be a priest and who lives in the Old City. “Last year was like a darkness that came over all of earth.” But for now, that togetherness still faces limits. There are still restrictions on the number of worshipers at Easter services. Masks are still a legal requirement. And foreigners still need an exemption to enter Israel — keeping out thousands of pilgrims, to the cost of local shopkeepers who depend on their business.

The virus emptied out New York’s churches. Will they fill up on Easter? Half-empty pews at a Palm Sunday mass at St. Sebastian’s Roman Catholic Church in Queens. Credit... Anna Watts for The New York Times The Rev. Henry Torres told his parishioners, who had gathered on Palm Sunday in socially distanced rows of half-empty pews, that God had not abandoned them. The coronavirus had killed dozens of regulars at the church, St. Sebastian Roman Catholic Church in Queens, N.Y., and the pandemic forced it to close its doors for months last year. But the parishioners were there now, he said, which was a sign of hope. “Even through difficulties, God is at work,” Father Torres said. “Even when people are suffering, even if it may seem that God is silent, that does not mean that God is absent.” That is a message that many Christians — and the cash-strapped churches that minister to them — are eager to believe this Easter, as the springtime celebration of hope and renewal on Sunday coincides with rising vaccination rates and the promise of a return to something resembling normal life. Religious services during the Holy Week holidays, which began on Palm Sunday and end on Easter, are among the most well-attended of the year, and this year they offer churches a chance to begin rebuilding their flocks and regaining their financial health. But the question of whether people will return is a crucial one. Across New York City, many churches have still not reopened despite state rules that would allow them to do so. The Rev. Dr. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, a nationally prominent Black church, said concerns over the virus, and its disproportionate impact on the Black community, would keep his church from reopening until at least the fall. Nicholas Richardson, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, said many of its churches had also not reopened. When the diocese introduced a program last fall to allow its 190 parishes to pay a reduced tithe to the diocese, roughly half of them applied. “It varies church by church,” he said. “Pledges are not necessarily dramatically down, but donations given to the collection plate are hopelessly down.”

Argentina’s president tests positive for virus, despite being fully vaccinated. President Alberto Fernández of Argentina receiving his first dose of the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine in January. Credit... via Reuters BUENOS AIRES — President Alberto Fernández of Argentina tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday and was experiencing mild symptoms despite having been vaccinated earlier this year, becoming the latest in a series of world leaders who have contracted the virus. In a series of tweets sent early Saturday, Mr. Fernández said a “light headache” and a temperature of 99.1 degrees had prompted him to take a quick antigen test. Its positive finding was confirmed later Saturday by a more rigorous PCR test, said Dr. Federico Saavedra, the president’s physician. Mr. Fernández’s symptoms were “mild due in large part to the protective effect of the vaccine,” Dr. Saavedra said. The president, who first learned the preliminary result on Friday, his 62nd birthday, said he would remain in isolation. “I am physically well, and although I would have liked to end my birthday without this news, I’m also in good spirits,” the president wrote on Twitter. Mr. Fernández joins a list of world leaders who have contracted the virus, including Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Emmanuel Macron of France and Donald Trump of the United States, during the final months of his presidency. But Mr. Fernández appears to be the first of those leaders to test positive for Covid-19 after having been fully vaccinated. He received the first dose of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine on Jan. 21 and the second dose on Feb. 11. Word of Mr. Fernández’s test results comes shortly after Argentina tightened its borders amid an upsurge of Covid-19 infections. Several neighboring countries, particularly Brazil, are experiencing a sharp increase in cases as new, more contagious variants of the virus engulf the region. Argentina recently canceled all direct flights with Brazil, Chile and Mexico in an effort to block the new strains. Argentina was the first country in Latin America to approve the use of the Sputnik V vaccine, in late December, but mass inoculations are taking longer than the government had initially predicted amid a global shortage of the vaccine. The country has also been administering China’s Sinopharm vaccine and Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Daniel Irungu/EPA, via Shutterstock Kenya has canceled the private importation and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, citing the need to safeguard against the possible introduction of fake doses and to ensure “greater transparency and accountability.” Licenses given to private hospitals and clinics to administer the vaccines were canceled and any entity found to be advertising or vaccinating people for a fee will be prosecuted, the National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus said on Friday evening. “Participation of the private sector in the vaccination exercise threatens the gains made in the fight against Covid-19 and puts the country at international risk should counterfeit commodities find their way into the Kenyan market,” read a statement signed by the health minister Mutahi Kagwe. The suspension comes days after private health facilities started administering Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, charging up to $70 for a shot. While the vaccine had received emergency use authorization in Kenya, there was confusion when some health officials said the jabs were not approved for commercial sale. The authorities said those who received the first dose of vaccine through private plans would receive their second dose when due, but did not specify how. Last month, Kenya received its first Covid-19 vaccines — over a million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot supplied through the global initiative known as Covax. So far, nearly 200,000 doses have been administered, with most going to health workers, security officers and teachers, along with people over 58. But the first batch of Covax vaccines came a month late and the next shipment, which was expected this month, is already facing delays. “There is an expectation that they will begin again in full in May, with catch-up accelerating thereafter,” a Covax spokesman said in a statement. The suspension also comes as Kenya is undergoing a third wave of soaring infection rates, rising deaths and scarce intensive care unit beds. To curb the spread, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a partial lockdown last week, including longer curfew hours, the closure of bars and schools, and limiting traveling in Nairobi, the capital, and surrounding counties. On Friday, the British Embassy in Kenya said that beginning April 9, travelers who have been in or passed through Kenya in the past 10 days will be denied entry into England. British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights will be required to quarantine in a government-approved facility for 10 days.

Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times Parisians filled packed trains on Saturday as France entered a third lockdown, with the national rail authority saying it expected nearly 1 percent of the country’s population to travel over the weekend despite lockdown restrictions. Intensive care units in France are now as full as they were in April last year at the peak of the first wave, and on Saturday the country of 67 million recorded over 46,000 new cases and 301 deaths. Although new measures include a ban on traveling farther than 10 kilometers, about six miles, from home except for essential reasons and a 7 p.m. curfew, many bought train tickets after President Emmanuel Macron announced the new lockdown on Wednesday. Mr. Macron had said that those living in urban areas could use the Easter weekend to travel to the countryside and spend the three-weeks-long lockdown there, and the authorities said they would also show “tolerance” over the weekend to let parents arrange for child care with grandparents. Similar moves last year prompted anger from local residents and fears that city dwellers living in areas with high rates of infection would spread the virus to regions that had so far been spared. Yet nothing like last year’s exodus was expected. Some Parisians left the capital last month after restrictions were imposed in the city and its surroundings. The new restrictions, which also include bans on gatherings of more than six people and on outdoor drinking, now apply nationwide. Schools will also shut. In La Baule, a popular seaside town of 17,000 on the Western coast, the mayor told Le Monde that he expected more than 30,000 people to flock to the resort town for the third lockdown. “To leave at any cost,” Le Parisien newspaper wrote on its Saturday front page.

Amsterdam’s leaders are trying to remake its tourism industry before tourists return. The Red Light District in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, was nearly deserted on Thursday night. Credit... Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York Times When international travel came to a halt last year, Amsterdam — like cities everywhere — was drained of tourists almost overnight. The effect, according to Sonia Philipse, the owner of the restaurant Lavinia Good Food, was both surreal and serene: Without the crowds, her city was quieter and more beautiful than she had ever seen it. “At this point we’re missing our tourists again,” Ms. Philipse said recently. “But I think there was a moment of really big joy in getting our city back.” In 2019, a record-breaking 21.7 million people visited Amsterdam, a city with a population of about 870,000. After the pandemic wiped out tourism in 2020, and with visitor numbers still low, Amsterdam’s leaders are trying to introduce new restrictions in an effort to ensure that old problems stemming from tourism don’t reappear when visitors return. Even before the pandemic, city leaders put in place measures to try to address residents’ complaints about disruptive tourists who disrespected prostitutes, drove up housing prices by occupying short-term vacation rentals and had taken over some of the city’s most beautiful, historic areas. Officials raised the tourist tax and banned several types of businesses, including guided tours of the Red Light District, new hotels in the city center and new shops that cater to tourists. “Constantly increasing numbers of visitors, misconduct, a shrinking retail mix, rising property prices, commercialization of public space and criminal subversion all call for measures to be taken,” Amsterdam’s mayor, Femke Halsema, wrote of the city center in a letter to the City Council in 2019. Ms. Halsema proposed four scenarios for the future of sex work in the Red Light District. One of those scenarios — the relocation of sex workers to a “prostitution hotel” elsewhere in the city — recently attracted the support of a majority of City Council members and is awaiting full approval. Another headline-grabbing proposal from the mayor’s office would make it illegal for visitors to buy cannabis in Amsterdam’s coffee shops, which are concentrated in the Red Light District, an ancient part of Amsterdam’s city center and a huge magnet for tourists. Amsterdam has also joined more than 20 other European cities to advocate stricter rules on vacation-rental platforms at the European Commission and in the European Parliament. The proposals have provoked opposition from local business owners and those in the sex work industry, who argue that the government should increase enforcement of existing prohibitions against public urination, public drunkenness and disturbing the peace.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Covid-19 Live Updates: Under Pressure From Governors, More U.S. Schools Reopen","Live Covid-19 Live Updates: Under Pressure From Governors, More U.S. Schools Reopen Both Republican and Democratic governors are acting to overcome union resistance and bureaucratic hesitancy. Citing fear of counterfeit vaccines, Kenya halts the private importation of doses. RIGHT NOW More than 3 million people are now receiving a Covid vaccine in the U.S. each day.

A bipartisan group of governors is making a big push to reopen U.S. schools. Students at the Green Mountain School in Woodland, Wash., completing a health screening before entering on Feb. 18. Credit... Nathan Howard/Getty Images In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine offered school districts early access to vaccines for their staff if they committed to opening classrooms by March 1. In Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency related to child and adolescent mental health and banned fully virtual instruction starting in April. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker announced that most elementary schools would be required to offer full-time in-person instruction by April 5, and most middle schools by April 28. The three are part of a significant and bipartisan group of governors who have decided it is time to flex some muscle and get students back into classrooms, despite union resistance and bureaucratic hesitancy. The push has come from both ends of the political spectrum. Democratic governors in Oregon, California, New Mexico and North Carolina, and Republicans in Arizona, Iowa, West Virginia and New Hampshire, among other states, have all taken steps to prod, and sometimes force, districts to open. The result has been a major increase in the number of students who now have the option of attending school in-person, or will in the next month. According to a school reopening tracker created by the American Enterprise Institute, 7 percent of the more than 8,000 districts being tracked were operating fully remotely on March 22, the lowest percentage since the tracker was started in November. Forty-one percent of districts were offering full-time in-person instruction, the highest percentage in that time. Those findings have been echoed by other surveys. In interviews, several governors described the factors motivating their decision to push districts to reopen, including the substantial evidence that there is little virus transmission in schools if mitigation measures are followed, the decline in overall cases from their January peak, and, most of all, the urgency of getting students back in classrooms before the school year ends. “Every day is an eternity for a young person,” Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said. “We just could not wait any further.” In the weeks since most of the governors acted, nationwide cases have started to rise again, which could complicate the effort to get children back in school. Many school staff members have already been offered vaccines, which has reduced the resistance from teachers’ unions to reopening and, provided staff vaccination rates are high, will limit the opportunities for the virus to spread in schools. Even so, in areas where cases are increasing sharply, like Michigan, some schools have had to revert to remote learning temporarily because so many students were in quarantine. But for the time being, at least, the moves by these governors have yielded significant results. In Ohio, nearly half of all students were in districts that were fully remote at the beginning of 2021. By March 1, that number was down to 4 percent, and it has shrunk further in the weeks since. In Washington, before Mr. Inslee issued his proclamation, the state’s largest district, Seattle Public Schools, was locked in a standoff with its teachers’ union over a reopening plan. Days after Mr. Inslee announced he would require districts to bring students back at least part time, the two sides reached an agreement for all preschool and elementary school students and some older students with disabilities to return by April 5. And in Massachusetts, the move by Mr. Baker, a Republican, has spurred a sea change, with dozens of districts bringing students back to school for the first time since the pandemic began, and hundreds shifting from part-time to full-time schedules. “It’s worked exceedingly well,” Mr. DeWine, also a Republican, said of his decision to offer vaccines to Ohio districts that pledged to reopen. “We’ve got these kids back in school.”

‘We have gained hope again’: Israel’s successful vaccine campaign makes crowds possible again during Holy Week. Christian worshipers at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, during a Good Friday procession in Jerusalem. Credit... Dan Balilty for The New York Times JERUSALEM — In the Old City of Jerusalem on Friday morning, in the alleys of the Christian quarter, it was as if the pandemic had never happened. The winding passageways that form the Via Dolorosa, along which Christians believe Jesus hauled his cross toward his crucifixion, were packed with over 1,000 worshipers. The Good Friday procession, where the faithful retrace the route Jesus is said to have taken, was back. “It is like a miracle,” said the Rev. Amjad Sabbara, a Roman Catholic priest who helped lead the procession. “We’re not doing this online. We’re seeing the people in front of us.” Pandemic restrictions forced the cancellation of last year’s ceremony and required priests to hold services without congregants present. Now, thanks to Israel’s world-leading vaccine rollout, religious life in Jerusalem is edging back to normal. And on Friday, that brought crowds back to the city’s streets, and relief to even one of Christianity’s most solemn commemorations: the Good Friday procession. For much of the past year, the pandemic kept the Old City eerily empty. But with nearly 60 percent of Israeli residents fully vaccinated, the city’s streets were once again thrumming, even if international tourists were still absent. At the gathering point for the procession on Friday, there was scarcely space to stand. The crowd moved slowly off, singing mournful hymns as they proceeded along what Christians consider a re-enactment of Jesus’ last steps. In the alley outside the chapel of St. Simon of Cyrene, the marchers trailed their fingers over an ocher limestone in the chapel wall. According to tradition, Jesus steadied himself against the stone after a stumble. Finally, they reached the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which believers think was the site of Christ’s crucifixion, burial and, ultimately, resurrection. For some, the Good Friday procession carried even more resonance than usual — its themes of suffering, redemption and renewal seeming particularly symbolic as the end of a deadly pandemic appeared finally in sight. “We have gained hope again,” said George Halis, 24, who is studying to be a priest and who lives in the Old City. “Last year was like a darkness that came over all of earth.” But for now, that togetherness still faces limits. There are still restrictions on the number of worshipers at Easter services. Masks are still a legal requirement. And foreigners still need an exemption to enter Israel — keeping out thousands of pilgrims, to the cost of local shopkeepers who depend on their business.

The virus emptied out New York’s churches. Will they fill up on Easter? Half-empty pews at a Palm Sunday mass at St. Sebastian’s Roman Catholic Church in Queens. Credit... Anna Watts for The New York Times The Rev. Henry Torres told his parishioners, who had gathered on Palm Sunday in socially distanced rows of half-empty pews, that God had not abandoned them. The coronavirus had killed dozens of regulars at the church, St. Sebastian Roman Catholic Church in Queens, N.Y., and the pandemic forced it to close its doors for months last year. But the parishioners were there now, he said, which was a sign of hope. “Even through difficulties, God is at work,” Father Torres said. “Even when people are suffering, even if it may seem that God is silent, that does not mean that God is absent.” That is a message that many Christians — and the cash-strapped churches that minister to them — are eager to believe this Easter, as the springtime celebration of hope and renewal on Sunday coincides with rising vaccination rates and the promise of a return to something resembling normal life. Religious services during the Holy Week holidays, which began on Palm Sunday and end on Easter, are among the most well-attended of the year, and this year they offer churches a chance to begin rebuilding their flocks and regaining their financial health. But the question of whether people will return is a crucial one. Across New York City, many churches have still not reopened despite state rules that would allow them to do so. The Rev. Dr. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, a nationally prominent Black church, said concerns over the virus, and its disproportionate impact on the Black community, would keep his church from reopening until at least the fall. Nicholas Richardson, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, said many of its churches had also not reopened. When the diocese introduced a program last fall to allow its 190 parishes to pay a reduced tithe to the diocese, roughly half of them applied. “It varies church by church,” he said. “Pledges are not necessarily dramatically down, but donations given to the collection plate are hopelessly down.”

Argentina’s president tests positive for virus, despite being fully vaccinated. President Alberto Fernández of Argentina receiving his first dose of the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine in January. Credit... via Reuters BUENOS AIRES — President Alberto Fernández of Argentina tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday and was experiencing mild symptoms despite having been vaccinated earlier this year, becoming the latest in a series of world leaders who have contracted the virus. In a series of tweets sent early Saturday, Mr. Fernández said a “light headache” and a temperature of 99.1 degrees had prompted him to take a quick antigen test. Its positive finding was confirmed later Saturday by a more rigorous PCR test, said Dr. Federico Saavedra, the president’s physician. Mr. Fernández’s symptoms were “mild due in large part to the protective effect of the vaccine,” Dr. Saavedra said. The president, who first learned the preliminary result on Friday, his 62nd birthday, said he would remain in isolation. “I am physically well, and although I would have liked to end my birthday without this news, I’m also in good spirits,” the president wrote on Twitter. Mr. Fernández joins a list of world leaders who have contracted the virus, including Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Emmanuel Macron of France and Donald Trump of the United States, during the final months of his presidency. But Mr. Fernández appears to be the first of those leaders to test positive for Covid-19 after having been fully vaccinated. He received the first dose of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine on Jan. 21 and the second dose on Feb. 11. Word of Mr. Fernández’s test results comes shortly after Argentina tightened its borders amid an upsurge of Covid-19 infections. Several neighboring countries, particularly Brazil, are experiencing a sharp increase in cases as new, more contagious variants of the virus engulf the region. Argentina recently canceled all direct flights with Brazil, Chile and Mexico in an effort to block the new strains. Argentina was the first country in Latin America to approve the use of the Sputnik V vaccine, in late December, but mass inoculations are taking longer than the government had initially predicted amid a global shortage of the vaccine. The country has also been administering China’s Sinopharm vaccine and Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Mr. Fernández joins a list of world leaders who have contracted the virus, including Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Emmanuel Macron of France and Donald Trump of the United States, during the final months of his presidency. But Mr. Fernández appears to be the first of those leaders to test positive for Covid-19 after having been fully vaccinated. He received the first dose of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine on Jan. 21 and the second dose on Feb. 11. Word of Mr. Fernández’s test results comes shortly after Argentina tightened its borders amid an upsurge of Covid-19 infections. Several neighboring countries, particularly Brazil, are experiencing a sharp increase in cases as new, more contagious variants of the virus engulf the region. Argentina recently canceled all direct flights with Brazil, Chile and Mexico in an effort to block the new strains. Argentina was the first country in Latin America to approve the use of the Sputnik V vaccine, in late December, but mass inoculations are taking longer than the government had initially predicted amid a global shortage of the vaccine. The country has also been administering China’s Sinopharm vaccine and Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Kenya, expressing concern about counterfeit vaccines, blocks private imports of doses. Officials at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, in Nairobi last month, logging Kenya’s first delivery of Covid-19 vaccine through the global initiative known as Covax. Credit... Daniel Irungu/EPA, via Shutterstock Kenya has canceled the private importation and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, citing the need to safeguard against the possible introduction of fake doses and to ensure “greater transparency and accountability.” Licenses given to private hospitals and clinics to administer the vaccines were canceled and any entity found to be advertising or vaccinating people for a fee will be prosecuted, the National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus said on Friday evening. “Participation of the private sector in the vaccination exercise threatens the gains made in the fight against Covid-19 and puts the country at international risk should counterfeit commodities find their way into the Kenyan market,” read a statement signed by the health minister Mutahi Kagwe. The suspension comes days after private health facilities started administering Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, charging up to $70 for a shot. While the vaccine had received emergency use authorization in Kenya, there was confusion when some health officials said the jabs were not approved for commercial sale. The authorities said those who received the first dose of vaccine through private plans would receive their second dose when due, but did not specify how. Last month, Kenya received its first Covid-19 vaccines — over a million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot supplied through the global initiative known as Covax. So far, nearly 200,000 doses have been administered, with most going to health workers, security officers and teachers, along with people over 58. But the first batch of Covax vaccines came a month late and the next shipment, which was expected this month, is already facing delays. “There is an expectation that they will begin again in full in May, with catch-up accelerating thereafter,” a Covax spokesman said in a statement. The suspension also comes as Kenya is undergoing a third wave of soaring infection rates, rising deaths and scarce intensive care unit beds. To curb the spread, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a partial lockdown last week, including longer curfew hours, the closure of bars and schools, and limiting traveling in Nairobi, the capital, and surrounding counties. On Friday, the British Embassy in Kenya said that beginning April 9, travelers who have been in or passed through Kenya in the past 10 days will be denied entry into England. British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights will be required to quarantine in a government-approved facility for 10 days.

Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times Parisians filled packed trains on Saturday as France entered a third lockdown, with the national rail authority saying it expected nearly 1 percent of the country’s population to travel over the weekend despite lockdown restrictions. Intensive care units in France are now as full as they were in April last year at the peak of the first wave, and on Saturday the country of 67 million recorded over 46,000 new cases and 301 deaths. Although new measures include a ban on traveling farther than 10 kilometers, about six miles, from home except for essential reasons and a 7 p.m. curfew, many bought train tickets after President Emmanuel Macron announced the new lockdown on Wednesday. Mr. Macron had said that those living in urban areas could use the Easter weekend to travel to the countryside and spend the three-weeks-long lockdown there, and the authorities said they would also show “tolerance” over the weekend to let parents arrange for child care with grandparents. Similar moves last year prompted anger from local residents and fears that city dwellers living in areas with high rates of infection would spread the virus to regions that had so far been spared. Yet nothing like last year’s exodus was expected. Some Parisians left the capital last month after restrictions were imposed in the city and its surroundings. The new restrictions, which also include bans on gatherings of more than six people and on outdoor drinking, now apply nationwide. Schools will also shut. In La Baule, a popular seaside town of 17,000 on the Western coast, the mayor told Le Monde that he expected more than 30,000 people to flock to the resort town for the third lockdown. “To leave at any cost,” Le Parisien newspaper wrote on its Saturday front page.

Amsterdam’s leaders are trying to remake its tourism industry before tourists return. The Red Light District in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, was nearly deserted on Thursday night. Credit... Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York Times When international travel came to a halt last year, Amsterdam — like cities everywhere — was drained of tourists almost overnight. The effect, according to Sonia Philipse, the owner of the restaurant Lavinia Good Food, was both surreal and serene: Without the crowds, her city was quieter and more beautiful than she had ever seen it. “At this point we’re missing our tourists again,” Ms. Philipse said recently. “But I think there was a moment of really big joy in getting our city back.” In 2019, a record-breaking 21.7 million people visited Amsterdam, a city with a population of about 870,000. After the pandemic wiped out tourism in 2020, and with visitor numbers still low, Amsterdam’s leaders are trying to introduce new restrictions in an effort to ensure that old problems stemming from tourism don’t reappear when visitors return. Even before the pandemic, city leaders put in place measures to try to address residents’ complaints about disruptive tourists who disrespected prostitutes, drove up housing prices by occupying short-term vacation rentals and had taken over some of the city’s most beautiful, historic areas. Officials raised the tourist tax and banned several types of businesses, including guided tours of the Red Light District, new hotels in the city center and new shops that cater to tourists. “Constantly increasing numbers of visitors, misconduct, a shrinking retail mix, rising property prices, commercialization of public space and criminal subversion all call for measures to be taken,” Amsterdam’s mayor, Femke Halsema, wrote of the city center in a letter to the City Council in 2019. Ms. Halsema proposed four scenarios for the future of sex work in the Red Light District. One of those scenarios — the relocation of sex workers to a “prostitution hotel” elsewhere in the city — recently attracted the support of a majority of City Council members and is awaiting full approval. Another headline-grabbing proposal from the mayor’s office would make it illegal for visitors to buy cannabis in Amsterdam’s coffee shops, which are concentrated in the Red Light District, an ancient part of Amsterdam’s city center and a huge magnet for tourists. Amsterdam has also joined more than 20 other European cities to advocate stricter rules on vacation-rental platforms at the European Commission and in the European Parliament. The proposals have provoked opposition from local business owners and those in the sex work industry, who argue that the government should increase enforcement of existing prohibitions against public urination, public drunkenness and disturbing the peace.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Covid-19 Live Updates: Under Pressure From Governors, More U.S. Schools Reopen","Live Covid-19 Live Updates: Under Pressure From Governors, More U.S. Schools Reopen Both Republican and Democratic governors are acting to overcome union resistance and bureaucratic hesitancy. Citing fear of counterfeit vaccines, Kenya halts the private importation of doses. RIGHT NOW More than 3 million people are now receiving a Covid vaccine in the U.S. each day.

A bipartisan group of governors is making a big push to reopen U.S. schools. Students at the Green Mountain School in Woodland, Wash., completing a health screening before entering on Feb. 18. Credit... Nathan Howard/Getty Images In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine offered school districts early access to vaccines for their staff if they committed to opening classrooms by March 1. In Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency related to child and adolescent mental health and banned fully virtual instruction starting in April. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker announced that most elementary schools would be required to offer full-time in-person instruction by April 5, and most middle schools by April 28. The three are part of a significant and bipartisan group of governors who have decided it is time to flex some muscle and get students back into classrooms, despite union resistance and bureaucratic hesitancy. The push has come from both ends of the political spectrum. Democratic governors in Oregon, California, New Mexico and North Carolina, and Republicans in Arizona, Iowa, West Virginia and New Hampshire, among other states, have all taken steps to prod, and sometimes force, districts to open. The result has been a major increase in the number of students who now have the option of attending school in-person, or will in the next month. According to a school reopening tracker created by the American Enterprise Institute, 7 percent of the more than 8,000 districts being tracked were operating fully remotely on March 22, the lowest percentage since the tracker was started in November. Forty-one percent of districts were offering full-time in-person instruction, the highest percentage in that time. Those findings have been echoed by other surveys. In interviews, several governors described the factors motivating their decision to push districts to reopen, including the substantial evidence that there is little virus transmission in schools if mitigation measures are followed, the decline in overall cases from their January peak, and, most of all, the urgency of getting students back in classrooms before the school year ends. “Every day is an eternity for a young person,” Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said. “We just could not wait any further.” In the weeks since most of the governors acted, nationwide cases have started to rise again, which could complicate the effort to get children back in school. Many school staff members have already been offered vaccines, which has reduced the resistance from teachers’ unions to reopening and, provided staff vaccination rates are high, will limit the opportunities for the virus to spread in schools. Even so, in areas where cases are increasing sharply, like Michigan, some schools have had to revert to remote learning temporarily because so many students were in quarantine. But for the time being, at least, the moves by these governors have yielded significant results. In Ohio, nearly half of all students were in districts that were fully remote at the beginning of 2021. By March 1, that number was down to 4 percent, and it has shrunk further in the weeks since. In Washington, before Mr. Inslee issued his proclamation, the state’s largest district, Seattle Public Schools, was locked in a standoff with its teachers’ union over a reopening plan. Days after Mr. Inslee announced he would require districts to bring students back at least part time, the two sides reached an agreement for all preschool and elementary school students and some older students with disabilities to return by April 5. And in Massachusetts, the move by Mr. Baker, a Republican, has spurred a sea change, with dozens of districts bringing students back to school for the first time since the pandemic began, and hundreds shifting from part-time to full-time schedules. “It’s worked exceedingly well,” Mr. DeWine, also a Republican, said of his decision to offer vaccines to Ohio districts that pledged to reopen. “We’ve got these kids back in school.”

‘We have gained hope again’: Israel’s successful vaccine campaign makes crowds possible again during Holy Week. Christian worshipers at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, during a Good Friday procession in Jerusalem. Credit... Dan Balilty for The New York Times JERUSALEM — In the Old City of Jerusalem on Friday morning, in the alleys of the Christian quarter, it was as if the pandemic had never happened. The winding passageways that form the Via Dolorosa, along which Christians believe Jesus hauled his cross toward his crucifixion, were packed with over 1,000 worshipers. The Good Friday procession, where the faithful retrace the route Jesus is said to have taken, was back. “It is like a miracle,” said the Rev. Amjad Sabbara, a Roman Catholic priest who helped lead the procession. “We’re not doing this online. We’re seeing the people in front of us.” Pandemic restrictions forced the cancellation of last year’s ceremony and required priests to hold services without congregants present. Now, thanks to Israel’s world-leading vaccine rollout, religious life in Jerusalem is edging back to normal. And on Friday, that brought crowds back to the city’s streets, and relief to even one of Christianity’s most solemn commemorations: the Good Friday procession. For much of the past year, the pandemic kept the Old City eerily empty. But with nearly 60 percent of Israeli residents fully vaccinated, the city’s streets were once again thrumming, even if international tourists were still absent. At the gathering point for the procession on Friday, there was scarcely space to stand. The crowd moved slowly off, singing mournful hymns as they proceeded along what Christians consider a re-enactment of Jesus’ last steps. In the alley outside the chapel of St. Simon of Cyrene, the marchers trailed their fingers over an ocher limestone in the chapel wall. According to tradition, Jesus steadied himself against the stone after a stumble. Finally, they reached the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which believers think was the site of Christ’s crucifixion, burial and, ultimately, resurrection. For some, the Good Friday procession carried even more resonance than usual — its themes of suffering, redemption and renewal seeming particularly symbolic as the end of a deadly pandemic appeared finally in sight. “We have gained hope again,” said George Halis, 24, who is studying to be a priest and who lives in the Old City. “Last year was like a darkness that came over all of earth.” But for now, that togetherness still faces limits. There are still restrictions on the number of worshipers at Easter services. Masks are still a legal requirement. And foreigners still need an exemption to enter Israel — keeping out thousands of pilgrims, to the cost of local shopkeepers who depend on their business.

The virus emptied out New York’s churches. Will they fill up on Easter? Half-empty pews at a Palm Sunday mass at St. Sebastian’s Roman Catholic Church in Queens. Credit... Anna Watts for The New York Times The Rev. Henry Torres told his parishioners, who had gathered on Palm Sunday in socially distanced rows of half-empty pews, that God had not abandoned them. The coronavirus had killed dozens of regulars at the church, St. Sebastian Roman Catholic Church in Queens, N.Y., and the pandemic forced it to close its doors for months last year. But the parishioners were there now, he said, which was a sign of hope. “Even through difficulties, God is at work,” Father Torres said. “Even when people are suffering, even if it may seem that God is silent, that does not mean that God is absent.” That is a message that many Christians — and the cash-strapped churches that minister to them — are eager to believe this Easter, as the springtime celebration of hope and renewal on Sunday coincides with rising vaccination rates and the promise of a return to something resembling normal life. Religious services during the Holy Week holidays, which began on Palm Sunday and end on Easter, are among the most well-attended of the year, and this year they offer churches a chance to begin rebuilding their flocks and regaining their financial health. But the question of whether people will return is a crucial one. Across New York City, many churches have still not reopened despite state rules that would allow them to do so. The Rev. Dr. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, a nationally prominent Black church, said concerns over the virus, and its disproportionate impact on the Black community, would keep his church from reopening until at least the fall. Nicholas Richardson, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, said many of its churches had also not reopened. When the diocese introduced a program last fall to allow its 190 parishes to pay a reduced tithe to the diocese, roughly half of them applied. “It varies church by church,” he said. “Pledges are not necessarily dramatically down, but donations given to the collection plate are hopelessly down.”

Credit... via Reuters BUENOS AIRES — President Alberto Fernández of Argentina tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday and was experiencing mild symptoms despite having been vaccinated earlier this year, becoming the latest in a series of world leaders who have contracted the virus. In a series of tweets sent early Saturday, Mr. Fernández said a “light headache” and a temperature of 99.1 degrees had prompted him to take a quick antigen test. Its positive finding was confirmed later Saturday by a more rigorous PCR test, said Dr. Federico Saavedra, the president’s physician. Mr. Fernández’s symptoms were “mild due in large part to the protective effect of the vaccine,” Dr. Saavedra said. The president, who first learned the preliminary result on Friday, his 62nd birthday, said he would remain in isolation. “I am physically well, and although I would have liked to end my birthday without this news, I’m also in good spirits,” the president wrote on Twitter.

A vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and a fully vaccinated person has received all required doses of a vaccine. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a person who is “fully vaccinated” has received two doses.

While vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally, most countries have focused their early vaccination efforts on priority groups like the clinically vulnerable; people in their 60s, 70s and older; and front-line workers, like doctors and nurses. Israel is vaccinating its population faster than any other country, with 113 doses administered for every 100 people.

How Trump Steered Supporters Into Unwitting Donations,"Stacy Blatt was in hospice care last September listening to Rush Limbaugh’s dire warnings about how badly Donald J. Trump’s campaign needed money when he went online and chipped in everything he could: $500.

It was a big sum for a 63-year-old battling cancer and living in Kansas City on less than $1,000 per month. But that single contribution — federal records show it was his first ever — quickly multiplied. Another $500 was withdrawn the next day, then $500 the next week and every week through mid-October, without his knowledge — until Mr. Blatt’s bank account had been depleted and frozen. When his utility and rent payments bounced, he called his brother, Russell, for help.

What the Blatts soon discovered was $3,000 in withdrawals by the Trump campaign in less than 30 days. They called their bank and said they thought they were victims of fraud.

“It felt,” Russell said, “like it was a scam.”

But what the Blatts believed was duplicity was actually an intentional scheme to boost revenues by the Trump campaign and the for-profit company that processed its online donations, WinRed. Facing a cash crunch and getting badly outspent by the Democrats, the campaign had begun last September to set up recurring donations by default for online donors, for every week until the election.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
One Republican’s Lonely Fight Against a Flood of Disinformation,"Now he says it “gives me shivers” to be called a Republican. He hopes to show that there is still a way to beat back the lies and false beliefs that have spread from the fringe to the mainstream. It is a heavy lift, and one that depends on overcoming two strong impulses: politicians’ fear of losing elections and people’s reluctance to accept that they were taken in by a lie.

Mr. Riggleman summarized his conversations with the 70 percent of House Republicans he said were privately appalled at the former president’s conduct but wouldn’t dare speak out.

“‘We couldn’t do that in our district. We would lose,’” he said. “That’s it. It’s that simple.”

Stocky, fast-talking and inexhaustibly curious, the former congressman is now working for a group of prominent experts and academics at the Network Contagion Research Institute, which studies the spread of disinformation in American politics and how to thwart it. The group has undertaken several extensive investigations into how extremists have used propaganda and faked information to sow division over some of the most contentious issues of the day, like the coronavirus pandemic and police violence.

Their reports have also given lawmakers a better understanding of the QAnon belief system and other radical ideologies that helped fuel the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

Mr. Riggleman said he had written one report about the involvement of far-right militants and white supremacist groups in the attack specifically at the request of a Republican member who needed help convincing colleagues that far-left groups were not the culprits.

Getting lawmakers to see radical movements like QAnon as a threat has been difficult. Joel Finkelstein, the director of the Network Contagion Research Institute, said that in June, when the group tried to sound the alarm on QAnon to members of Congress, Mr. Riggleman was the only one who responded with a sense of urgency and agreed to help.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"In Moving All-Star Game, Another Sport Flexes Its Activist Muscles","Activism’s arrival in sports is not new, of course. From baseball’s Robinson to boxing’s Muhammad Ali to football’s Colin Kaepernick to soccer’s Megan Rapinoe, athletes have long pressed social-justice causes important to them and their communities. But the breadth and the public nature of the efforts over the past year, as social justice protests swept the nation on the eve of a presidential election, have shown the willingness of leagues, teams and athletes to engage in debates and take positions they had often avoided.

Sometimes the shift was done reluctantly, the result of national politics or changing public opinion. Sometimes teams and leagues were prodded to act by their own players. But Friday showed once again that sports isn’t simply entertainment in a vacuum.

“Throughout the year, there’s been a lot of things going on not only with the pandemic but as a society,” Alex Cora, the Boston Red Sox Manager, told reporters on Friday. “They moved it for the right reasons.”

It was only five years ago that Kaepernick’s decision to quietly kneel during the national anthem to protest systemic racism and police brutality sparked stiff disapproval from some team owners and criticism from a strident part of the white fan base. But eventually, even N.F.L. owners like the Dallas Cowboys’ Jerry Jones, who once ordered his players not to kneel during the national anthem, were joining them in the gesture on the sidelines.

And players, aware that their wealth and their stature gave them a valuable megaphone aided by social media, kept pressing. After Jacob Blake, a Black man, was left paralyzed by the police in Kenosha, Wis., the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take part in a playoff game in August in Orlando, Fla. Within hours, dozens of other teams in other leagues had joined the work stoppage. Within days, the basketball players emerged from a meeting with N.B.A. officials with new commitments that it would join their fight against social injustice.

Some players went beyond causes to overtly political acts like campaigning for specific candidates. In the W.N.B.A., players on the Atlanta Dream became so infuriated by the statements by the team’s co-owner, the Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, about the Black Lives Matter movement that they actively campaigned for her opponent, Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, wearing T-shirts with his name onto the court. Loeffler lost the election, sweeping not just her opponent but also another Democrat running in the state to victory.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Kemp Lashes M.L.B. as Republicans Defend Georgia’s Voting Law,"Mr. Kemp, who is gearing up to run for re-election in 2022, has striven to re-enter the good graces of Republican voters after becoming a central political target of former President Donald J. Trump because of his refusal to help Mr. Trump overturn the state’s election results last year. A former secretary of state of Georgia who has his own record of decisions that made voting harder for the state’s residents, he is again a key G.O.P. voice leading the charge on the issue.

On Saturday, he repeatedly tried to paint the league’s decision as driven by Stacey Abrams, the voting rights advocate and former Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia who is seen as likely to challenge Mr. Kemp again next year.

Ms. Abrams, one of the most prominent critics of Georgia’s voting law, has pushed back on calls for sports leagues and corporations to boycott the state. She said on Friday that she was “disappointed” baseball officials had pulled the All-Star Game but that she was “proud of their stance on voting rights.”

In defending the law in Georgia, Mr. Kemp singled out two Democratically controlled states, New York and Delaware, and compared their voting regulations with the new law in Georgia. Those states do not offer as many options for early voting as Georgia does, but they have also not passed new laws instituting restrictions on voting.

“In New York, they have 10 days of early voting,” Mr. Kemp said (New York actually has nine). “In Georgia, we have a minimum of 17, with two additional Sundays that are optional in our state. In New York, you have to have an excuse to vote absentee. In Georgia, you can vote absentee for any reason.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Georgia’s Election Law, and Why Turnout Isn’t Easy to Turn Off","A more rigorous study by political scientists at Stanford found that no-excuse mail voting might have increased turnout by a whopping 0.02 percent in the 2020 election. The study used a novel approach: The researchers compared the turnout among 65-year-olds in Texas, who were eligible to vote by mail without an excuse, with 64-year-olds in Texas, who weren’t. The turnout among 64-year-olds was indistinguishable from that of 65-year-olds, even though the latter group voted by mail in large numbers.

Like Georgia, Texas did not require an identification to vote by mail, but has a strict ID requirement for in-person voting.

The partisan makeup of the electorate didn’t appear to change, either. The Democratic share of voters appeared to tick up by two-tenths of a percentage point — enough to decide a very close election. But it’s also so small that it could just be statistical noise, with no effect at all. Social science methods just don’t offer the level of precision necessary to nail down whether this, or any, change might move the needle by a tenth of a point.

The Georgia law doesn’t come anywhere close to eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, unlike what the political scientists tested in Texas. As a result, one might expect the new law to have an even smaller effect. (You could make a counterintuitive argument that making absentee voting harder is worse for Democrats than eliminating it altogether, and that Democrats might be better off discouraging people from mail voting to avoid unnecessary ballot rejections of people who could have successfully voted in person.)

The Georgia runoff elections, while hardly a scientific case study, nonetheless offer another useful example. There were fewer opportunities to vote in advance compared with the general election, because of the shorter election campaign and the holiday season. Based on the drop-off in early voting, many analysts wound up underestimating the final turnout by 20 percent or more. In the end, turnout exceeded expectations. The number of Election Day voters was higher than it was in the general election, as many people who might have voted early if it weren’t for Christmas or New Year’s Day now turned out on Election Day.

Maybe runoff turnout would have been higher with the same early voting opportunities as in the general. But maybe not. And none of this had any discernible negative effect on the Democrats, who of course did better than they did in the general.

Why doesn’t convenience matter?

How is it possible that something like eliminating no-excuse absentee mail voting, a method beloved by millions of voters, wouldn’t materially affect turnout or election results?",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Driver Rams Into Officers at Capitol, Killing One and Injuring Another","WASHINGTON — The band of razor wire-topped fencing around the Capitol had recently come down. The heavy National Guard presence had begun to thin.

But on Friday, not quite three months after the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, a car came careening midday onto the Capitol grounds, slamming into two Capitol Police officers and leaving one of them dead and the other injured.

This time, the source of the violence was not an angry pro-Trump mob, but a lone driver, armed with a knife, who had recently told friends he had left his job and had “afflictions.” After crashing his car and menacing officers, he was shot and killed.

“It is with a very, very heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries,” Yogananda D. Pittman, the acting Capitol Police chief, said during a news conference near the scene. “This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol Police, after the events of Jan. 6 and now the events that have occurred here today.”",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Here’s what we know and don’t know about the attack outside the Capitol.,"Early Friday afternoon, the United States Capitol was locked down after a suspect rammed a vehicle into two Capitol Police officers. Here is what we know as of 7:30 p.m.

One Capitol Police officer was killed, and another officer was injured. The suspect was also killed.

The officer who died has been identified as William F. Evans, an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police.

The suspect has been identified as Noah Green, 25, of Indiana. On his Facebook page, he said he was struggling during the pandemic and described himself as a follower of Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam.

Mr. Green rammed a vehicle into the two officers, then got out of the vehicle and lunged at the officers with a knife, according to the acting chief of the Capitol Police.

The Capitol was locked down around 1 p.m., and the police declared the threat “neutralized” about an hour and a half later.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
‘I Was Failing’: Bystanders Carry Guilt From Watching George Floyd Die,"“If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided,” he said in court.

Adam Abumayyaleh, who owns Cup Foods with his brothers, said in an interview that Mr. Martin came to him in tears after Mr. Floyd had died and said it was his fault.

“I told him, ‘Stop it, that’s nonsense,’” said Mr. Abumayyaleh, who was not called to testify.

Mr. Martin stopped working at Cup Foods, telling Mr. Abumayyaleh that coming to the neighborhood gave him bad energy.

Mr. Abumayyaleh himself sometimes wonders “What if?” He was the manager on duty the night Mr. Floyd died and had instructed a clerk to call the police after Mr. Floyd twice refused to return to the store after using the fake bill.

Mr. Abumayyaleh said he had been back at work for just three days last May, following a severe bout with Covid-19. He was in the middle of a three-hour job unlocking cellphones and was distracted. Had he not been busy, he said, he likely would have been the one to go out and confront Mr. Floyd and his friends about the fake bill, and the outcome might have been different.

“If I can go back, of course I would not call the police,” he said. “Objectively, I know we didn’t do anything wrong. We are not responsible for the police being bad people.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
6 Takeaways From the First Week of the Derek Chauvin Trial,"“Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you’re about to give is the truth, and nothing but the truth?” “I do.” “Have a seat.” “Please. Thank you. And so when we’re looking, I’m going to have you identify this individual here —” “George Floyd.” “And that’s Mr. Floyd, who you had the conversation with.” “Correct.” “All right. And then this individual right in here. Who’s that?” “That’s me.” “All right.” “Can you describe for the jurors, you know, generally what his demeanor was like — what was his condition like?” “So when I asked him if he played baseball, he went on to respond to that. But it kind of took him a little long to get to what he was trying to say. So it would appear that he was high.” “So you just had some signs that you thought he was under the influence of something?” “Yes.” “All right. But were you able to carry on at least some conversation with him?” “Yes.” “And did you eventually sell him something?” “Yes.” “That was what?” “The cigarette.” “Now, freeze it here. I’m sorry, I said I was going to let it run, but we saw you holding something up. Can you describe it? And again, for the record, this is 7:45:10 — describe for the jurors what you were doing there.” “I was holding up the $20 bill that I just received.” “And is that something you always do or something about this?” “No, when I saw the bill, I noticed that it had a blue pigment to it, kind of how a $100 bill would have. And I found that odd. So I assumed that it was fake.” “I know this is difficult. Can you just explain sort of what you’re feeling in this moment?” “I can’t. I feel helpless. I don’t have a mama either, but I understand him ...” [sobbing] “Let’s see your hands. Stay in the car. Let me see your other hand.” “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” “Let me see your other hand.” “Please, please ...” “Both hands.” “Put your hands up right now.” “Let me see your other hand.” “What’d I do, though?” “Put your hand up there. Put your hand up there. Keep your hands on the wheel. Hands on the wheel. Step out and face away.” “Please don’t shoot me.” Please don’t shoot me, man.” “Step out and face away.” “Can you not shoot me, man?” “I’m not shooting. Step out and face away.” “OK, OK. Please ...” “You can’t win.” “I’m not trying to win.” “Don’t get in a car. Don’t do me like that, man. OK, can I talk to you, please?”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
We Have All Hit a Wall,"“I feel fried,” said Erin H., a social media and event coordinator at a Midwestern university, whose work once inspired and excited her but currently seems like an unpleasant cocktail of boredom, dread and exhaustion. (She asked that her last name not be used so as not to upset her employers.) Things take longer to get done, she said, in part because she doesn’t want to do them.

“I’m out of ideas and have zero motivation to even get to a point where I feel inspired,” she wrote, responding to a request by The New York Times for people to describe their work- related challenges in Month 13 of the pandemic. “Every time my inbox dings, I feel a pang of dread.”

None of that is surprising, said Margaret Wehrenberg, an expert on anxiety and the author of the book “Pandemic Anxiety: Fear, Stress, and Loss in Traumatic Times.” A year of uncertainty, of being whipsawed between anxiety and depression, of seeing expert predictions wither away and goal posts shift, has left many people feeling that they are existing in a kind of fog, the world shaded in gray.

“When people are under a long period of chronic, unpredictable stress, they develop behavioral anhedonia,” Dr. Wehrenberg said, meaning the loss of the ability to take pleasure in their activities. “And so they get lethargic, and they show a lack of interest — and obviously that plays a huge role in productivity.”

Nearly 700 people responded to The Times’s questions, and the picture they painted was of a work force at its collective wits’ end. We heard from a clergyperson, a pastry chef, an I.C.U. nurse, a probation officer, a fast-food worker. Budget analysts, librarians, principals, college students holed up in childhood bedrooms, project managers, interns, real estate agents — their mood was strikingly similar, though their circumstances were different. As one respondent said, no matter how many lists she makes, “I find myself falling back into deep pajamaville.”

“I don’t think there’s anyone in the world who cannot say that the last year hasn’t been the hardest they’ve ever had,” Elizabeth Abend, 41, said in an interview. As head of human resources at a small chain of boutique fitness studios, Ms. Abend, who lives in Manhattan, has faced a cascade of challenges: having to tell casual employees there was no work; navigating uncertainty over when, and how, to reopen; pivoting to new digital services. And there has been loneliness, the death of her beloved dog, her own severe bout with Covid-19 last spring and the need, she said, “to be an adult human and pay bills and eat meals and all of that amid the exhaustion of having our entire world turned on its head.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Here’s What Readers Told Us About Feeling Burned Out,"At this point in the pandemic, it feels that we have, all, collectively, hit a wall. Last week, The New York Times asked readers to tell us about work burnout they’re experiencing — nearly 700 people responded in two days. The responses were funny, vulnerable and indicative of a universal sense of: “We’ve had enough.” The collective picture they painted was of a work force struggling to do tasks that were once easy, people who know they are lucky to have a job but dream of quitting, and who would do anything to never have a Zoom meeting again.

Here’s what else we heard from readers. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity, and some people preferred to give only their first names.

On what is particularly challenging and overwhelming about work right now

“Waking up and realizing, ‘I am going to stare at my laptop for 8 hours, maybe 9, maybe 10, log off, feel utterly unaccomplished because I have not left my small office/bedroom/yoga studio for the entire day, and do it all again for who knows how long.’ At this point I don’t know who is going to crack first, me or the pandemic.”

— Stephanie Soderlund, chemist, Portland, Ore.

“Logging off at the end of the day. It’s nearly impossible. Once the world went into lockdown a year ago, I felt like I logged onto work and I’m still waiting to log off.”

Two Brothers Posed for a Portrait. One Lived to See It in the Met.,"When Jeff Neal was 8 or 9 years old, an older friend would take him and his brother Toby on trips around the city. They’d go to the Empire State Building or the parks, and one day they went to a large apartment on the Upper West Side that was filled with paintings.

This was the mid-1960s.

The apartment was where Alice Neel lived, and it was the kind of place where people came and went freely. Ms. Neel was not famous yet — it was still a decade before she had her first museum show — and if her visitors caught her eye, she might ask to paint them.

The brothers’ friend, Allen Tobias, who was like a surrogate older brother, had arranged the visits, and he assured them: She’s going to be a famous painter someday.

The two boys sat for her perhaps a dozen times, returning week after week. And she always gave them snacks, recalled Jeff Neal, who’s now 64. “That’s what kept me sitting there.”",2021-04-02 00:00:00

"Opinion | Hunter Biden, Matt Gaetz and Nonstop Depravity","For years, Joe Biden’s second son has been a tabloid buffet of strippers, leaked photos, crack pipes, family love triangles, an incriminating laptop, a stray gun and ethical quandaries.

When the book was announced two months ago, it seemed like another bad calculation by Hunter, sure to overshadow his father’s presidential honeymoon.

But it isn’t. The book, ineffably sad and beautifully written, tears the tabloid face off the story about an American family that has experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. The outline is familiar but the details are wrenching, proving that drugs can drag anyone down, even a famous politician’s privileged son who drove into inner cities to buy crack in his Porsche and who had plenty of Burisma “funny money,” as he called it, to rehab-hop. Even his father, chasing him down a driveway after a family intervention, could not overcome “crack’s dark power.”

Page after page, you wonder: How the hell is this guy still alive?

At 51, Hunter has not lost his knack for getting tangled up in messes. He offered a disingenuous reply in a CBS interview airing Sunday about the notorious laptop he supposedly forgot to pick up from a Delaware repair shop: “There could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me. It could be that I was hacked. It could be that it was the — that it was Russian intelligence.” No one is buying that.

The book recounts a litany of other times he left incriminating evidence in rental cars, got ripped off in drug deals or had his Gucci loafers, $800 sports coat and Rimowa luggage stolen by the “scummy subculture” he was hanging with in Hollywood hotels.

And while he writes that he would not go on the Burisma board if he had to do it over again, because it allowed Trump to target him and his dad, he doesn’t acknowledge that his Ukraine and China dealings were super swampy.

Still, the book illuminates the underworld of addiction — our national shame — that left the son of a vice president and presidential candidate sharing an apartment with his crack connection in the shadow of the White House; sweating, crying, chanting the “Hail Mary,” dropping off the grid to live in a $59-a-night Super 8 motel off I-95, and getting blacklisted by one Hollywood hotel after another because of his “traveling band of vampires” straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie, “an opaque, sinister night world of interconnected lives that roamed L.A. between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m.,” consisting of “thieves, junkies, petty dealers, over-the-hill strippers, con artists and assorted hangers-on.” Not to mention Samoan gangsters with wild nicknames.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Opinion | Why Is Jesus Still Wounded After His Resurrection?,"He added this:

If a scar is a healed wound, a wound that the body has marvelously managed to rescue and restore — then in some way, Christ’s entire bodily form, having suffered the ultimate injury of death but having been rescued and restored, is that of a scar. He will be worshiped, the book of Revelation (5:6) says, in the form of “a Lamb looking as if it had been slain.” Perhaps our scars, which are so often a source of shame and regret, are the truest clues we have to the full form of our resurrection bodies.

These observations echo those of St. Augustine, who speculated that we shall see in the bodies of martyrs the traces of the wounds they bore for Christ’s name “because it will not be a deformity, but a dignity in them; and a certain kind of beauty will shine in them.”

Philip Yancey, in responding to my query about why the glorified body of Jesus would be disfigured by scars, said, “Jesus’ retained wounds stand as a visual proof.” Mr. Yancey, whose books include “What’s So Amazing About Grace?” and “The Jesus I Never Knew,” added:

He could have had a perfect body, or no body, when he returned to splendor in heaven. Instead he kept a remembrance of his visit to earth, and for a keepsake of his time here, he chose scars. The pain of humanity became the pain of God.

By now answers that had eluded me were coming into focus. “That Jesus’ wounds are also seen in his resurrected body underscores that the suffering love that led Jesus to a cross and to wear a crown of thorns is part of God’s eternal redeeming love for humanity,” Mark Labberton, the president of Fuller Theological Seminary, told me. “The scars witness to God’s suffering, resurrected hope.”

Beyond that, Dr. Labberton said, the fact that the traces of Jesus’ wounds aren’t simply wiped away allows us to “make meaning of our losses, and to make meaning of our lives.” In other words, an essential part of what happened to Jesus shouldn’t be forgotten — it cannot be forgotten — even in eternity.

In this way, it is similar to the situation facing victims of trauma, according to Dr. Labberton. To recover, they shouldn’t be told to forget their trauma; they need to find ways to re-contextualize and integrate it into their life stories. It is part of their story, never to be downplayed, but it need not define who they are in perpetuity. “The wounds of Jesus are not the final word,” according to Dr. Labberton, “but they are meaningful.”

Or, as Cherie Harder put it to me, “Healing requires seeing.”

Scott Dudley, the senior pastor at Bellevue Presbyterian Church in Bellevue, Wash., told me that when he’s counseling or mentoring others “often the most helpful thing I bring is my wounds.” He added, “Everything important about being a pastor I did not learn in seminary.” He learned it through the pain of a personal loss that will never completely fade. “Wounded people make the best healers because they know what it means to be wounded,” Dr. Dudley said. “I’m a better healer not in spite of my wounds, but because of my wounds.”

“All that to say sometimes the most helpful things we bring is our wounds, which is another reason Jesus kept a reminder of his,” he added. His point isn’t that Jesus’ wounds were flaws; it is that they were wounds that left scars, and that not hiding them from us is a great help to us.

This hints at one of the most important human (and divine) qualities: empathy. “If Jesus showed us his scars, even after his Resurrection, then maybe we can learn to integrate pain and suffering into our lives in a way that frees us from wasting energy spent in denial and shame,” Peggy Wehmeyer, a former religion correspondent for ABC News, told me. She knows of what she speaks, having poignantly written in these pages about the suicide of her husband in 2008.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Opinion | How Do We Stop the Parade of Gun Deaths?,"When Europeans lose their tempers, they punch someone; Americans pull out a handgun. Foreigners express road rage by cursing; a driver in North Carolina recently expressed his by firing shots into another car, killing a mother of six. Abroad, brutish husbands put wives in hospitals; American husbands put wives in coffins.

The guns used in highly publicized mass shootings get the most attention, and they reflect the changing American arsenal. I’m writing this on my family farm in Oregon where I grew up with firearms; there’s a .22 rifle in the closet. Those kinds of hunting rifles are rarely used in crimes, but in recent decades the “cool” weapons in some circles have become military-style semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 and AK-47 and military-style pistols like the Glock 17 that were designed to kill people.

“Assault rifles are the weapons of choice when someone wants to kill as many people as possible,” noted Michael R. Weisser, a gun store owner, author, N.R.A. member and self-described “gun nut” who has also sponsored a petition to ban assault rifles. “Since 2012 there have been 10 mass shootings resulting in 30 or more dead or wounded victims. Every single one of these shootings was accomplished with an AR or an AK.”

I’m sympathetic to the aim, but also wary. I’m not sure it’s possible to get any gun legislation through Congress right now, and certainly not a ban on assault weapons. It’s also true that while liberals loved the assault weapons ban for the 10 years it was in effect, there is no strong evidence that it saved lives — but it did turn the AR-15 into a conservative icon, so that today there appear to be more AR and AK rifles in private hands than in the United States military. And most crime and deaths involve handguns, not rifles.

But there is a way to stem the tide of a new type of gun that is proliferating unchecked. President Biden can use executive action to crack down on “ghost guns,” which avoid regulation and serial numbers because they are sold unfinished or as kits.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Opinion | George Floyd Felt Absolutely Helpless,"“I look at how that could have been one of them,” she added. She also said that there have “been nights I’ve stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more.”

She was 17 then. There were four police officers on or around him. She couldn’t see a way to help.

But society isn’t helpless. That’s why we have trials like this one. They’re our attempts to find the truth, to address any injustice, to declare our values — here’s what we will permit, and here’s what we won’t — and perhaps make us better in the long run.

Chauvin is charged with murder. At some point the trial, whose first week just concluded, will turn toward forensics and feuding claims over the specific cause of Floyd’s death. Chauvin’s defense attorney, Eric Nelson, will mine autopsy results for ambiguity. He’ll assert reasonable doubt that Chauvin’s knee was the murder weapon.

But Chauvin’s inhumanity is indisputable, and the depth of the mark that it left on the people who intersected with it has been heartbreaking to behold. What happened near the corner of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue on May 25, 2020, was a chilling lesson in power and powerlessness. It both validated and stoked their fears.

“I felt like I was in danger,” Frazier said. “I felt threatened.”

“I was scared,” said Kaylynn Ashley Gilbert, who was also 17 when she came upon that gruesome scene, where four men who were supposed “to protect and to serve,” in the motto of many police departments, were ordering bystanders to keep away as Floyd, losing breath, cried out for his mother.

“I don’t know if you’ve ever seen anybody be killed,” testified another witness, Genevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter who also found herself at the scene. “But it’s upsetting.” That was putting it mildly, to judge by her expression and her voice, in which there was still so much rage and so much regret that she couldn’t intervene.

“I was desperate to help,” Hansen said. But she was helpless.

She grabbed a tissue to sop up her tears. That gesture defined the first week of the trial as surely as laments of helplessness did. Floyd’s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, seemed to go through a whole box of tissues.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Opinion | Jeff Bezos Is Taunting Politicians. Will They Take the Bait?,"At first, it seemed like a bonkers strategy, and I immediately got numerous texts from high level and tough public relations folks in tech, all of whom were also dumbfounded. One savvy P.R. pro at a big tech company wrote to me: “Those Amazon tweets are malpractice. They are letting internal frustrations drive external messaging. Total lack of discipline.”

Indeed, it all felt oddly emotional and risky, which is why it was clear that the decision to launch such attacks could have been made only by someone who never suffers when mistakes are made: Mr. Bezos.

Why would he take such an approach?

I don’t think his intention was to influence the union vote in Alabama. Instead, the goal was to goad progressives into proposing legislation around things like data privacy and a $15 federal minimum wage that Mr. Bezos knows cannot pass without being watered down and, thus, made less dangerous to giants like Amazon.

After gaining immense power in the pandemic and becoming one of the best-liked brands around, the company is now saying to Washington legislators, who have dragged their feet and held endless and largely useless hearings about how to deal with tech: I dare you to regulate us.

For Amazon, weak regulation would certainly be much better than having to talk about the very real human toll that free shipping might have on its workers. It’s an attitude that we will see adopted by a lot more tech leaders who are going to try to use the momentum for regulation in their favor, rather than let it run over them.

In a recent congressional hearing, for example, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, sheepishly proposed changes to Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gives platforms broad immunity for content posted on their sites. Many observers felt, though, that Mr. Zuckerberg’s proposals were a smoke screen that would ultimately benefit Big Tech companies like Facebook.

It’s high-risk, but possibly high reward, which has been Mr. Bezos’ brand for his entire career, even before he was armed with all this power and money.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion | The Unsettling Power of Easter,"Hope is much harder to come by. The women did not go to the tomb looking for hope. They were searching for a place to grieve. They wanted to be left alone in despair. The terrifying prospect of Easter is that God called these women to return to the same world that crucified Jesus with a very dangerous gift: hope in the power of God, the unending reservoir of forgiveness and an abundance of love. It would make them seem like fools. Who could believe such a thing?

Christians, at their best, are the fools who dare believe in God’s power to call dead things to life. That is the testimony of the Black church. It is not that we have good music (we do) or excellent preaching (we do). The testimony of the Black church is that in times of deep crisis we somehow become more than our collective ability. We become a source of hope that did not originate in ourselves.

After we take off those suits and sundresses and hats, we return to a world that is racialized. The Black skin that set nicely against those yellows and blues also makes us stand out as we live in a world that calls our skin a danger. We need more than celebration; we need unsettling presence.

To listen to the plans of some, after the pandemic we are returning to a world of parties and rejoicing. This is true. Parties have their place. Let us not close all paths to happiness. But we are also returning to a world of hatred, cruelty, division and a thirst for power that was never quarantined. This period under pressure has freshly thrown into relief the fissures in the American experiment.

As we leave the tombs of quarantine, a return to normal would be a disaster unless we recognize that we are going back to a world desperately in need of healing. For me, the source of that healing is an empty tomb in Jerusalem. The work that Jesus left his followers to do includes showing compassion and forgiveness and contending for a just society. It involves the ever-present offer for all to begin again. The weight of this work fills me with a terrifying fear, especially in light of all those who have done great evil in his name. Who is worthy of such a task? Like the women, the scope of it leaves me too often with a stunned silence.

Opinion | What Can You Do Once You’re Vaccinated?,"Tara Haelle is a freelance science journalist and author of “Vaccination Investigation: The History and Science of Vaccines”

Americans have entered a new phase of the pandemic where a large number of them are vaccinated but most are not. That leads to a big question: What can you do after you’re fully vaccinated? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued new guidelines, and other experts have weighed in with their thoughts.

But when it comes to what you personally should or shouldn’t do, you will need to do your own risk assessment. I spoke to experts to develop a science-backed framework for post-vaccination decision-making. Here are important factors to keep in mind that, when paired with your own appetite for risk, can help you navigate this next stage of the pandemic.

What are you doing?

1. Is it indoors? Yes No Is there good ventilation? You may not know exactly what HVAC system is used, but open doors or windows can increase ventilation. Yes No 2. Will you be there for more than one hour? Yes No 3. Will the activity be high intensity or involve shouting? Yes No These questions do not take into account every possible factor relating to risk of infection, but they’re a place to start. How long an activity is and how ventilated the space will be play the biggest roles in safety. Even if you don’t know the ventilation system used in an indoor space, you can see if there’s an attempt to increase it, such as opening doors and windows. Public health officials use 15 minutes as the threshold of exposure to determine if someone is at risk for infection. We chose one hour to represent a moderately high risk.

Whom will you be with?

1. Will there be more than 10 people there? Yes No 2. Will you be around many people you don’t know? Yes No 3. Is everyone there vaccinated? Yes No 4. Are they following health guidelines? Such as wearing masks and social distancing. Yes No New C.D.C data suggests that the authorized Covid-19 vaccines reduce the risk of getting and spreading the coronavirus. There is still a small chance after vaccination that you can get the virus and spread it.

Who is in your circle?

1. Are there kids in your circle? Yes No 2. Are any adults in your household or circle unvaccinated? Yes No 3. Are any people in your household or circle immune-compromised, or unvaccinated and high risk? Yes No Young children cannot receive the vaccines yet, but they also are less likely to require hospitalization or die from Covid-19, unless they have an underlying condition or are high risk. They can still spread the virus, though. People with immune-compromising conditions (like cancer, H.I.V., organ transplants, etc.) can receive the vaccines, but scientists don’t yet know how well the vaccines protect them.

Where do you live or where will you be?

The C.D.C defines a high transmission rate of the coronavirus as 100 total cases per 100,000 people. Your county has a total of cases per 100,000 over the past seven days, giving it a risk rating



Test positivity refers to the proportion of tests in your community coming back positive. Your county has a test positivity rate of



The transmission rates where you live and where you’re headed are helpful data points, though not the whole story. Other people may be traveling from areas with different rates, and transmission and test positivity rates more broadly depend on testing availability and frequency. Regardless, knowing the rates offers a rough benchmark for thinking about the infection risk within the community.

Your own health

1. Do you have underlying health risks for Covid-19? Yes No 2. If you get sick, can you afford to stop working and isolate? Yes No 3. Will you have access to sick leave, testing and essential supplies if you get sick? Yes No All the vaccines authorized by the F.D.A. have been found to protect against death from Covid-19, and from severe disease and hospitalization. Still, the risk of infection is not zero.

How comfortable are you with the risk in these five areas?

Activity risk seems ... N/A Crowd risk seems ... N/A Risk to your circle seems ... N/A Location risk seems ... N/A Your health risk seems ... N/A

Now comes the tricky part: You have to weigh this knowledge against your own personal tolerance for risk. Are you a big risk taker or more conservative? It probably depends on the particular situation.

Only you can determine this risk-benefit calculation: Is a given activity worth the levels of risk based on the questions above? Are the risks primarily to you, or do they extend to others you care about? Some people may find that the activity is generally low risk, but having just one high-risk, unvaccinated person in their circle might dissuade them from participating. Is this a once-in-a-lifetime experience? Some events, like weddings, for example, will never happen again. Others, like travel to a foreign country, are easier to delay.

As has been the case since the pandemic began, be prepared to change your plans if the situation or science changes. As time goes on, for example, researchers will learn more about how long immunity from the vaccines last, and how effective the vaccines are against new variants that arise. In the meantime, as you come to understand the biggest factors that make any situation more or less safe, as well as your own personal risk threshold, post-vaccination decision making becomes easier — and life more enjoyable.",2021-03-30 00:00:00
Opinion | What Has the Pro-Life Movement Won?,"This means that while overturning Roe would probably prompt a pro-choice backlash in reaction to the court’s decision, there would be ample opportunities, in a world where abortion is returned to the democratic process, to make a pro-life case.

But the anti-abortion cause is closely linked to a culturally bunkered Republican Party and a weakened religious right, it has few media megaphones and weak financial backing, and a lot of the country just seems not to want to think too much about abortion and to punish the party that forces it to do so. So it’s extremely easy to imagine the end of Roe leading to a little more state regulation over all (mostly limitations in the second trimester, along the lines of many European countries), but then for the few states that go further to find themselves boycotted and besieged, leaving the goal of ending abortion nationwide as far away as ever.

Especially because the plausibility of that goal depends on whether the pro-life movement can prove — through very literal policy demonstrations, not just rhetoric — that it can protect and support the pregnant women who would no longer get abortions in the world that it desires. The pro-choice side insists that these women’s independence and well-being and equality depends on a right to end a life that, were it wanted, would be called by name and celebrated with ultrasound photos on the fridge. Against that argument the anti-abortion movement needs more than just the ultrasound photo: It needs to prove the pro-choice premise wrong.

The movement’s wiser leaders know this. Last year, for instance, The Atlantic’s Emma Green profiled Cheryl Bachelder, the former chief executive of Popeye’s and a rare pro-lifer in the C-suite world, who was working with other anti-abortion leaders “to brainstorm all the community support systems that would need to be stronger in a world where abortion is illegal: mental health services, addiction-recovery programs, affordable child care.” Green also reported that the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, has been compiling a database of state resources for pregnant women in preparation for the hoped-for end of Roe.

But, of course — as Green noted with dry understatement — actually getting a major expansion of social services in states that might conceivably ban abortion would require a different Republican Party than the one that exists today.

Over the last month, for instance, many socially conservative Republicans have been critiquing Romney’s proposed family benefit on the grounds that it might lead to more nonworking single mothers. This a reasonable worry, but it’s definitely the case that making abortion illegal would lead, in the short run, to more women raising kids in difficult circumstances. (The long-term cultural effects are a separate question.) And then it’s also the case that family grants like the Romney plan have been shown to reduce abortion rates when used in European countries.

Put these realities together, and you get a conclusion that most Republicans have not internalized. To restrict abortion in a just and sustainable way, to reduce both the personal hardship of parenting and the incidence of illegal abortion, you probably need some kind of policies like Romney’s plan no matter what the consequences for work incentives or single motherhood. More unintended births to poor women in the near term are a necessary price of pro-life victory — with the lives of the babies themselves the reason that price is very much worth paying.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion | The Perpetual Crisis at the Border — and What We Can Do About It,"“The border is not open,” the U.S. secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, told me in an interview. “What we have discontinued,” Mr. Mayorkas promised, “is the cruelty of the previous administration.”

Well, apparently, in Central America, people only heard the bit about “cruelty” being over, which is why so many migrants are heading north toward the border. Tens of thousands of asylum seekers, mostly from Central America, have waited for over a year in Mexican border towns and they will not waste this opportunity.

It should come as no surprise that this is happening along a border that divides one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world from one of its most economically unequal regions. Latin America’s poor and vulnerable — struggling amid a pandemic, the devastation of climate change and the violence of their homelands — are moving north to a safer, more prosperous place. It’s that simple. And this will keep happening for a long time.

Due to the pandemic, Latin America has experienced its “worst social, economic and productive crisis” in 120 years, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Two hurricanes — Eta and Iota — devastated Central America late last year. And gangs, corruption, violence, along with the repercussions of the environmental crisis and a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines, have forced many people to leave the region.

Mexico, in particular, has suffered greatly during the pandemic: More than 320,000 people have died from Covid-19, according to a recent government report, and Mexico’s economy declined 8.5 percent last year. To make matters worse, there is the terrible and intractable problem of drug-cartel violence. According to the head of the U.S. Northern Command, 30 percent to 35 percent of the country is under the control of “transnational criminal organizations.” This means that any migrants traveling north through Mexico are in immediate danger.

We must accept this unfortunate reality and create a system that can legally, efficiently and safely absorb more of these immigrants and refugees. They will keep coming; there is no other solution. All the other options — walls, detention facilities, family separation policies, forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, expedited repatriations and mass deportations — have failed. The $4 billion investment in Central America that President Biden has promised is a good starting point for tackling the origins of migration in the region: poverty and a lack of opportunity. That project, however, will take years to yield results.

In the meantime, the United States should start accepting between one and a half and two million authorized immigrants every year.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion | These Sacred Jewish Books Were Abandoned. Could I Save Them?,"But I am intensely proud of my Jewishness. To be too publicly proud of it nowadays, at least in my secular Jewish crowd, risks seeming parochial or chauvinistic, but privately I celebrate it in my own ways. And I’m protective of it, too. Extraordinary American tolerance has insulated me from any serious anti-Semitism, but I sometimes regret the luxury that tolerance has in turn conferred: to slight, hide or flee a bit too eagerly from their past. Seeing those books in that place touched something in me. I couldn’t just put them back.

I halfheartedly tried imagining some extenuating circumstances that landed them there. Perhaps they were thrown out accidentally in a spring cleaning. Or maybe the person who’d placed them there actually knew of the burial to which sacred texts are entitled and figured the landfill to which they’d soon be consigned fit the ritualistic requirements. But I doubt it. Whatever one thinks of being Jewish, the experience is sufficiently powerful that one doesn’t just stray idly from it: One has to push it away. And to me, that’s most likely what had happened here: Someone had just chucked the things, without so much as a second thought.

What could account for such disrespect, even contempt, not just for one’s ancestors, but for the tradition itself? Was there no one in the family with enough reverence for our past to cherish them, at least for another generation? And if not, why not find them a good home elsewhere? Or donate them to the state Jewish Historical Society, which might have welcomed two volumes with such a distinguished provenance? The family had directed that all memorial contributions in the man’s name be made to the local Jewish Federation. Why not there?

But more than indignation, I felt sadness. Sure, there are lots of people committed to keeping American Jewry going. But there are many, many others for whom it has become utterly irrelevant, for whom centuries of tradition, so wonderfully embodied around Seder tables this past week, are coming to an abrupt end. There are lots of ways to measure the end of a particular Jewish line; tossing prayer books in the trash is surely one, and among the more emphatic.

It’s self-serving, of course, but my notion of what constitutes a good Jew is broad. One can be one not only by following the rituals but also by honoring Jewish precepts and values, by trying to heal the world (the notion of tikkun olam) or by enriching it through teaching, creating, inspiring. Hannah Arendt, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Janet Yellin, Philip Roth, Andrew Goodman and Mickey Schwerner — to me, all were good Jews, whether or not they ever found their way to a synagogue.

I actually flirted with the idea of returning the books. There must have been some mistake, I might have said: You couldn’t have meant to dispose of such heirlooms in this fashion. But I didn’t. In the penumbra around the First Amendment surely lies a constitutional right to throw out whatever one wants. Meanwhile, a dear friend said she’d gladly take the books for her daughter, Aviva, whose bat mitzvah prayer book she’d just realized, much to her horror, she’d managed to misplace. Aviva was going off to college and had hoped to bring her prayer book with her; maybe she’d take these forsaken volumes and give them new life.

Before that happened, I’d hoped to memorialize them in some fashion and kept them on my desk, awaiting inspiration. But for all my self-righteousness, I proved a poor custodian. Not long ago, while I was out of town, the radiator alongside them blew; for a couple of days, in a scene with almost biblical overtones, they’d been engulfed in steam. Acts of God, it turns out, can damage the word of God: Overnight, some of those pristine pages turned into parchment. Despite the dehumidifiers, the first few crystals of mildew blossomed on the cover of one of them.

After all this, perhaps they’d have been better off left where I found them, but I had to go be a buttinsky. I’m hoping Aviva will still take, and cherish, them, despite their imperfections. But if not, it’s now on me to give them a more fitting burial.

My Covid-19 Patients Can't Get the Treatment They Need - The New York Times,"When President Donald Trump fell sick with Covid-19 in October, he received monoclonal antibodies, as did several senior members of his inner circle. All of them survived, as do nearly 90 percent of high-risk patients who are treated early with this medication.

But despite the extraordinary efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, this lifesaving treatment is often difficult for regular people to obtain. When I tried to secure insurance approval for monoclonal antibody treatment for a high-risk patient without symptoms, I was told that the person, who was also at high risk for Covid-19 complications, wasn’t yet sick, even though that is the best time to treat people who have tested positive for the coronavirus and are at risk of severe outcomes from Covid. I pushed back and prevailed.

In the past month, I have given monoclonal antibodies to three high-risk patients in whom Covid-19 was newly diagnosed. Two have cancer and are in their 80s, and the other is a 55-year-old who had recently received a bone-marrow transplant to treat lymphoma. Two of the patients had mild symptoms. The other felt unwell but had no symptoms of Covid.

All three patients responded well to the treatment, but each instance required me to obtain approval from the hospital’s infectious-disease, pulmonary-medicine, pharmacy and emergency departments, something I don’t typically have to do as a senior attending physician. Each time I stayed with the patient until late in the evening to ensure that the planned treatment was accomplished. Because monoclonal antibody treatment can be administered only in an outpatient setting such as an infusion center or an emergency room, in one case I had to persuade members of the admitting team to discharge a patient from the hospital so that they could send him to the emergency room to receive the care he needed.

A colleague and I recently called all the hospitals in New York City’s five boroughs to find out whether they offer monoclonal antibodies to high-risk patients with Covid-19. Only three said they could provide the therapy to a high-risk patient without symptoms. Some said they would need to evaluate a patient in their emergency room, and others either didn’t know about monoclonal antibodies or would not discuss a referral.",2021-03-31 00:00:00

After a year of disproportionate loss from the pandemic and the continuous threat of police violence, on top of centuries of discrimination and disenfranchisement, what does healing look like for Black Americans? The photographers Gioncarlo Valentine and Elliott Jerome Brown Jr. traveled to Virginia, the Carolinas, Louisiana and Georgia looking for answers to that question — reaching out to friends and family, artists and organizations along the way. They sought to document the rituals and relationships that create space for joy, solace and restoration.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
The Latest Issue in Divorces: Who Gets the Embryos?,"“It’s so common that now it’s a routine question that I have to ask: Is there any genetic material that we need to talk about?” said Monica Mazzei, a family lawyer at Sideman & Bancroft who represents high net worth clients in Silicon Valley.

In the event of divorce, she said, “you’re not together anymore, you probably don’t like each other and if one person is going to use the embryo and have the child, that leaves the other person in an awkward spot.”

Several major clinics said that the use of I.V.F. and other fertility treatments had risen during the coronavirus pandemic, with more people reassessing what matters to them.

The New York University Langone Fertility Center, one of the busiest in the United States, saw a 30 percent increase in the number of new patients from June to December last year, compared with the same period in 2019. Another clinic, Seattle Reproductive Medicine, saw a 15 percent increase in the number of new patients last year compared with 2019. The National Embryo Donation Center in Knoxville, Tenn., the largest embryo donation clinic in the country, estimates that there are 1 million to 1.3 million frozen embryos in storage, up from about 500,000 to 600,000 a decade ago.

“For New Yorkers, they’re actually sitting still,” said Dr. Brooke Hodes-Wertz, a specialist at N.Y.U. Langone Fertility Center.

I.V.F. requires self-administering daily injections of fertility drugs, called gonadotropins, for eight to 12 days in order to stimulate the ovaries so that they mature numerous eggs. Next, a doctor guides a needle through the vagina to retrieve the eggs while the patient is under anesthesia. The eggs are then fertilized with sperm in the clinic’s laboratory, and one or more embryos are placed back into the womb, or they can be tested for genetic abnormalities and frozen for a future embryo transfer.

I.V.F. can take a physical and emotional toll on patients, but working from home makes it easier. And at the moment, patients can undergo treatment without having to tell colleagues about appointments for blood tests or having to commute to an office, Dr. Hodes-Wertz said.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Sorry, Sometimes You Do Have to Be Uncomfortable","That said, you can do only so much and, frankly, you have done enough.

Stress Level at a 10

I work for a nonprofit, where I’ve been employed for most of the past 30-plus years. I’m a bit of a workaholic. A few weeks ago, my manager asked everyone at a meeting to say what our stress level is, on a one to 10 scale. I said the truth: 10. One week later, the manager’s theme for her morning email was time management: Basically, anyone who says she is busy or has too much work actually has poor time management skills. I considered this to be a public shaming of me and one colleague who also self-reported a high level of stress. The email is not the only thing I don’t like about the manager, but it feels like the proverbial straw, the latest in a stream of disrespectful actions. Do all bosses do this? If I decide to stick it out until I’m eligible for Social Security, what’s the best approach? — Anonymous, Madison, Wis.

Your manager is passive aggressive and has some toxic ideas about work culture. I don’t know that she was shaming you as much as she was judging you, which isn’t much better. But who cares what she thinks? You’re stressed out. Most people are. Your manager is just being petty. Ignore her silly provocations. You’ve been at your organization for more than 30 years. You can see the light at the end of the employment tunnel. You can and will get through this. If you have the energy for it, you can certainly look for new employment. Or you can just stick it out. You didn’t share how much longer you have to work to qualify for Social Security benefits, but I am guessing it’s fewer than 10 years. It’s time to figure out who you are beyond your work. You can be great at your job without being a workaholic. Keep doing your best, but find other things outside of work to put some of that intensity into. As I’ve written before in this column, the job will never love you. Do not invest the whole of your identity in what you do for a living because when the job refuses to love you back, when it lets you down, you’re left with nothing and you deserve much better.

A Sly Salary Negotiation

I’m in the process of hiring a new writer. She impressed us all in the interview process. We made her an offer and she verbally accepted. Then she sent us some questions about details of the offer. We sent some benefit details and vague info on our growth numbers, given the nondisclosure agreement she signed. The day her acceptance was due back, she phoned human resources — not me, the hiring manager — to say she had another offer at a startlingly high salary. She said she’d take our offer for an additional $10,000. I really doubt the level of the second offer. But others wanted to push forward and gave her a $5,000 bump. When I phoned with the counteroffer, I mentioned her competing offer and she brushed it off — ‘Oh, that, I wouldn’t take that. I’d like to work for you.’ I feel like we’ve been played. I can’t shake the feeling that she lied to us and went around me. What do I do with this feeling? — Anonymous

Your new employee is not taking money out of your bank account. Why are you so pressed about her negotiating tactics or how much she is being paid? You don’t know for certain that she is lying about the competing offer but, if she is, she is not the first nor will she be the last person to manifest an imaginary job offer to negotiate higher compensation. It sounds as if she was savvy, did her homework and shot her shot. Let go of the feeling that she lied and circumvented your authority. She has hustle. She will, hopefully, bring that hustle to the job every day and be a great employee. If not, you will handle the matter accordingly. I understand why you are irked about the way she went about this, but that’s your bruised ego talking. Nurse the bruise and move on. You’re still the boss.

Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022,"Titled Arise Ohio, the Facebook page is the creation of the American Culture Project — a nonprofit whose website says its mission is to “empower Americans with the tools and information necessary to make their voices heard in their local communities, statehouses and beyond.”

Undisclosed on the Facebook page is the nonprofit’s partisan goal. Arise Ohio and similar sites aimed at other politically pivotal states are part of a novel strategy by a little-known, Republican-aligned group to make today’s GOP more palatable to moderate voters ahead of the 2022 midterms by reshaping the “cultural narrative” on hot-button issues.

AD

AD

That goal, laid out in a private fundraising appeal sent last month to a Republican donor and reviewed by The Washington Post, relies on building new online communities that can be tapped at election time, with a focus on winning back Congress in 2022.

“We’ve created a persuasion machine that allows conservatives to reach, engage and move people to action like never before,” the solicitation states. “Now is the time to expand and capitalize on this machine, setting the political playing field in advance of the 2022 election.”

Titled “Reclaiming the Public Narrative,” the solicitation argues that the left, because of its clout within cultural institutions, has more access to centrist voters while the right is stuck “within its own echo chamber.” It says the group will collect personal data gathered from petitions and other online tools to target voters using “language consumed by those in the persuadable middle.”

AD

AD

The solicitation was sent to Warren Stephens, a billionaire banker based in Arkansas who backed President Donald Trump’s reelection effort. It was also inadvertently directed to someone who shared the communications with The Post. The documents provide an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of a group whose activities are ordinarily veiled and illustrate how the Republican Party, still largely defined by Trump, is straining to connect with the country’s political center.

Stephens, through a spokesman, declined to say whether he had made a contribution to the project.

The American Culture Project is set up as a social welfare organization exempt from disclosing its donors or paying federal income taxes but, in exchange, barred from making politics its primary focus. The project is led by an Illinois-based conservative activist, John Tillman, who also oversees a libertarian think tank and a news foundation that recently received grant money to highlight opposition to public health restrictions. Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”

AD

AD

“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”

While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building. It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as local news outlets crater and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.

The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”

Building a persuasion machine

The American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known. Its website is bare of an employee roster. A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”

AD

AD

But the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”

“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”

The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.

AD

AD

According to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.

In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.

The expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24 million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.

The arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.

Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”

Driving engagement

Communications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.

Mighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post. The issue touched a nerve for one of the page’s followers, who wrote: “Both belong in prison, one for killing the elderly the other for crimes against humanity.”

AD

Among the most popular of the American Culture Project’s pages, Mighty Michigan has gained about 30,000 followers since it was created in the fall of 2019. Accompanying the Facebook page is a private group called We Are Mighty. The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers. “Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.

The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit. The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed. The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.

The connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website. “Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states. It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”

“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.

The message delivered privately to potential donors is different. “We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.

Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states. In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.

The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project. “This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the announcement from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.

The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold. Arise Ohio and other pages in Tillman’s network often post stories produced by the Center Square.

The news site, which is among a growing number of journalistic initiatives undertaken by operatives from both parties, received more than 300,000 average monthly visits last year, according to analysis completed by the website analytics firm SimilarWeb. Tillman, in an email, said he has “no involvement at all in the editorial decisions made at the Franklin News Foundation.”

Though it declares no partisan affiliation, the news foundation has been led by people tied to Republican politics. Recent tax filings identify its director as Kristina Rasmussen, who was chief of staff to Republican Bruce Rauner when he was governor of Illinois, though she wrote in an email that she stepped down from the role as director several years ago.

Rasmussen is now a leader of the American Culture Project. In the March 1 email to Stephens, Rasmussen was identified as the project’s executive director. She declined to comment on the project.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
The next phase of Biden’s presidency will be harder — and riskier,"That stimulus package was designed primarily to have the government send money to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments, most of it either to deal with aspects of the coronavirus or to provide assistance to those in need. In other words, it was mostly free money (if you care nothing about debt and deficits), in the same way as the earlier measures dealing with the pandemic and economy.

AD

The president’s new proposal is different. It is an attempt to address America’s aging infrastructure, along with other measures that include money for research and development, upgrading water systems, rebuilding housing stock and schools, and even expanding the availability of long-term and at-home health-care services.

The administration is also promising a second and related initiative in the coming weeks that could be nearly as large as the proposal unveiled last week. It won’t be an infrastructure plan in the classic sense but rather investments in human beings, particularly those least advantaged.

The price tag for the infrastructure package Biden announced in Pittsburgh comes in at about $2.25 trillion in new spending plus $400 billion in proposed clean energy tax credits. The administration promises to pay for it with an increase in the corporate tax rate plus a series of other changes, including encouraging other countries to change their taxation of corporations.

The spending timetable in the infrastructure package is an eight-year path. But it will take 15 years of the proposed tax increases to cover the cost of the eight years of spending. The package would increase the deficit approximately $900 billion over 10 years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

AD

AD

Over a 15-year time period, it would be deficit neutral and after that, because the taxes are proposed as permanent and the spending will have run its course, the proposal as a whole will begin to reduce the deficit. Revenue projections that far into the future, however, are not terribly reliable.

The structure of the spending and taxes is an implicit acknowledgment that the scale of the spending outstrips the administration’s willingness to raise taxes enough to offset the cost over the same time period. This is political ambition colliding with political reality. Other tax increases will be needed to pay for the second piece of this two-part initiative, likely higher income tax rates for top earners.

The kinds of measures in the new package that deal directly with infrastructure have been advocated for many years by both Republican and Democratic elected officials. But the package is far more expansive than that. Biden is looking to combat the larger threats posed by climate change with proposals that would wean the country off fossil fuels and move toward a carbon neutral economy. He is also attacking economic, racial and health inequities that have long existed in society but which have been exposed more glaringly by the pandemic.

AD

AD

The scale of Biden’s agenda has been compared to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, which created Social Security and helped to shape the modern central government. Biden’s ambitions also rival those of Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society, which brought the country Medicare, Medicaid, the War on Poverty and a significant expansion in federal aid to education. Those are the lasting records of the New Deal and the Great Society, and part of the legacies of FDR and LBJ. Biden has yet to truly set his legacy.

“I think the infrastructure plan is much more important for the economy [than the stimulus package], both in terms of long-term growth and because it has a very substantial labor and racial equity component,” said Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama and is now a professor at Harvard University. “Not just growth but how that growth is shared. . . . So it’s much more important and much more ambitious and for those reasons much harder to get done.”

Biden has seen much change in his half-century of public service, the ebb and flow of ideologies and ideas and the shifting power balance between the two major parties. The early months of his presidency may appear to represent a departure from what his past posture and record might have foreshadowed, but the confluence of need and opportunity met him at the door of the Oval Office and he has decided to take advantage, moving as swiftly and expansively as he can.

AD

AD

To get this done, Biden again seems ready to try without Republican votes. The prospects for Republican support in Congress for the new package are minimal, given Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s vow to oppose the plan “every step of the way” and the party-line votes by which the stimulus package reached Biden’s desk.

When confronted with criticism that he is breaking his vow to work in a bipartisan fashion, Biden has tried to flip the script to define bipartisanship as reflecting public opinion, not the votes of lawmakers. So far public opinion is with him. The American Rescue Plan is broadly popular, though fewer than half of rank-and-file Republicans say they support it. Still, that is better than the unified opposition of congressional Republicans.

The infrastructure package is new enough that there’s not much reliable survey data, though parts of what Biden is proposing have enjoyed public support in the past, even if not always seen as the highest of priorities. Raising taxes on corporations is also generally supported, as long as they don’t appear to constrain the economy.

AD

AD

Republican pollster Whit Ayres said Republicans ought not to reflexively oppose the package, given that many Americans see the need to upgrade the country’s infrastructure. However, he said that though tax hikes on corporations are popular, Republicans still can find legitimate grounds to oppose them. “There is an economic argument to be made here, a serious argument about U.S. competitiveness,” he said.

Raising taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers also has long been popular. Biden has promised that people with incomes below $400,000 will not have their taxes raised, though the full details of his forthcoming tax proposals affecting individuals aren’t yet known and he could face stiff debate generally on the revenue side of his initiatives.

Democratic strategists acknowledge that the size of Biden’s proposals leave Democrats open to the familiar charge that they are the party of tax-and-spend and wasteful government, though they say Republicans will attach that label to anything Biden proposes, so why not go big. “The Republicans can say tax-and-spend all you want,” Democratic strategist Jeffrey Pollock said. “If the voters feel the Democrats have taken the economy in the right direction, that’s a win for us.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Family of Capitol attack suspect expresses sympathy for officer who was killed,"Green’s relatives wrote they “feel great sympathy for the officer whose life was taken and the other injured during these events.” They said upon learning of the attack, they “were just as taken aback as the rest of the nation from this horrific event.”

AD

Green was identified as the suspect by several people familiar with the investigation. Police have not yet officially released the assailant’s identity.

Meanwhile, sympathies continue to pour in for the 18-year veteran of the Capitol force who was killed, William “Billy” Evans, who according to a neighbor was the father of two children. His family has asked for privacy to mourn.

AD

The other officer suffered injuries not believed to be life-threatening and was hospitalized on Friday.

On Saturday, the Capitol Police said on Twitter that the department “is deeply grateful for the support we’ve received from around the world. We wish we could respond to each one of you. Please know your sympathy is appreciated beyond words.”

AD

Evans is the second Capitol Police officer to die in the line of duty this year; Officer Brian D. Sicknick died of injuries he suffered fighting a riotous mob during the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.

Four civilians died in that riot and two police officers who were there later took their own lives. Authorities and family for Evans have not yet announced memorial or funeral plans. Sicknick was honored during a service at the Capitol.

Friday’s attack occurred about 3:15 p.m. at a police checkpoint outside the Capitol on Constitution Avenue. Police said the vehicle rammed the officers standing at a barrier.

AD

A high school physics teacher from Herndon said he saw the crash while driving by. He parked and headed toward the officers to help when he said the suspect exited his vehicle holding a knife in his right hand and walked toward him.

AD

The teacher said he backed up, and the armed suspect turned, rushed back toward the checkpoint and was shot. Acting Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman on Friday said the suspect had lunged at officers with the knife.

Acting D.C. police chief Robert J. Contee III, whose department investigates all death cases in the District, said authorities do not believe terrorism was a motive.

On Friday, Brendan Green told The Washington Post that his brother, who had been a defensive back on the Christopher Newport University football team, had slid into deep paranoia. His family and friends said he blamed people he knew for drugging him with Xanax, and that he later became addicted.

On his Facebook page, Green listed himself as a “Follower of Farrakhan” — an apparent reference to Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Black nationalist group Nation of Islam. Green’s last post links to a video of Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam, that Green said was a “divine warning to us all during these last days of our world as we know it.”

In the statement on Saturday, Green’s family described him as a “strong man, a college graduate, an upcoming finance guru, a beloved friend, son, brother and uncle and athlete of the community.”

The relatives said Green had been studying for his master’s in business administration and was “growing into a very established man of society.”

But after graduating college, the family statement said, “he began to experience hardships among his peers” that may have stemmed from repeated head trauma during his years playing football.

The family did not elaborate on any injuries Green may have suffered or say whether he had been in medical care or had any diagnoses.

Green was not known to either D.C. or Capitol police, according to authorities. “It does not appear to be terrorism-related,” acting D.C. police chief Robert J. Contee III told reporters.

The incident occurred shortly after 1 p.m. on Constitution Avenue near the Russell Senate Office Building, once again drawing hundreds of police officers to the Capitol and plunging the sprawling complex into lockdown, with people inside buildings told to stay away from windows and those outside told to “seek cover.”

Authorities lifted the lockdown about 3:15 p.m., though parts of Constitution Avenue and other streets remained closed. President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ordered flags at the White House and at the Capitol to be flown at half-staff. Evans is the sixth member of the Capitol Police force to die in the line of duty.

AD

“Today, America’s heart has been broken by the tragic and heroic death of one of our Capitol Police heroes,” Pelosi said in a statement, calling Evans “a martyr for our democracy.”

AD

Biden said in a statement that he was being briefed on the investigation by a Homeland Security adviser. He and first lady Jill Biden said they were “heartbroken” by the attack and Evans’s death.

The attack comes less than three months after the Jan. 6 insurrection that left five people dead, including Capitol Police officer Brian D. Sicknick. Two police officers who had been at the riot later died by suicide.

In a statement, Pelosi added that officers once again “risked their lives to protect our Capitol and our Country, with the same extraordinary selflessness and spirit of service seen on January 6.”

“I’m heartbroken for the officer killed today defending our Capitol and for his family,” said Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “I’m praying for the officer injured and his family. We’re in their debt.”

The Capitol Police Labor Committee called the circumstances of Evans’s death a “catastrophic example of the risks” officers take “putting themselves in harm’s way to protect our Capitol, its occupants, and the seat of democracy itself.”

After Friday’s incident, the D.C. National Guard activated its new “immediate response force,” a group of troops who already were on Capitol grounds as part of a 2,300-member deployment for added security. On Friday, two dozen National Guard members formed a line across Independence Avenue, wearing helmets and body armor and carrying plastic shields.

A blue sedan remained at the scene, with its taillights flashing and trunk open, surrounded by crime-scene tape, near the temporary fence and at a permanent police checkpoint.

At a news conference outside the Capitol, Pittman said the driver of the vehicle entered what is called the North Barricade “and rammed into two officers” before hitting a barrier.

Steve Brown, a 60-year-old high school physics teacher at Herndon High School in Virginia, said he was driving on Constitution Avenue and saw the vehicle strike the officers.

He said he parked, got out and walked toward the barricade. He said the attacker got out of the blue vehicle with a knife in his right hand. He said the knife appeared to be at least 10 inches long.

AD

Brown said that the man walked toward him and that he backed up. He said the attacker turned and headed back toward the barricade, where he was shot.

Pittman said the man did not respond to verbal commands before the officers fired.

Both injured officers were taken to hospitals, where Evans died. Capitol Police said the second officer’s injuries were believed to be non-life-threatening. “Please keep the U.S. Capitol Police in your prayers,” Pittman said.

The driver, Green, was a onetime defensive back on Christopher Newport University’s football team who later moved to Indianapolis, and then to Botswana, before calling his brother in Virginia seeking help, his brother said.

AD

His brother said Green had suffered hallucinations, heart palpitations, headaches and suicidal thoughts that could have been related to drugs or mental illness. Green wrote on his Facebook page that he had embarked on a spiritual journey and that “these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher.”

Although the Capitol was largely empty because both chambers were on recess, a number of congressional staffers were on or near the campus as the incident unfolded.

One congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to speak publicly, said he was walking to the Longworth House Office Building to get his first coronavirus vaccine shot when his phone buzzed. He could hear the sirens.

“If you are outside, seek cover,” the alert warned.

“So I ran to my car,” he said.

It was supposed to be his first time back to his office since the Jan. 6 insurrection.

Ralph Jones, communications director for Rep. A. Donald McEachin (D-Va.), had also chosen Friday as his first day back in the building since Jan. 6. He came to renew his security badge allowing access to buildings in the complex. Fifteen minutes after he left, as he sat on a Metro train headed home, the urgent warning popped up on his phone, too.

He decided he would not be returning to the Capitol until he was mandated to do so.

“I squeaked out just in time, and I have no plans to go back any time soon,” he said. “Really there’s nothing stopping me from going except that home still feels much safer to me than being in the Capitol, and it has nothing to do with covid-19.”

His death comes less than three months after the agency’s officers fought to protect lawmakers by clashing with a riotous mob that descended on the Capitol building in January, leaving one officer dead and scores of others injured.

On Friday, Pittman was forced to address yet another deadly attack at the Capitol complex — this one resulting in the death of Evans, who joined the force in 2003 and was a member of the first-responder unit.

The assailant, identified by several people familiar with the investigation as Noah Green, was shot and killed by police.

“It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the passing of Officer William ‘Billy’ Evans this afternoon from injuries he sustained following an attack at the North Barricade by a lone assailant,” Pittman said in a statement.

AD

Evans was the sixth member of the Capitol Police force to die in the line of duty, according to the department. The casualties include Officer Brian D. Sicknick, who died Jan. 7, one day after the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

AD

News of Evans’s death prompted an outpouring of condolences from lawmakers and officials, including President Biden, who on Friday afternoon ordered White House flags to be lowered to half-staff.

“We know what a difficult time this has been for the Capitol, everyone who works there, and those who protect it,” Biden said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a statement called Evans a “martyr for democracy.”

“Today, America’s heart has been broken by the tragic and heroic death of one of our Capitol Police heroes: Officer William Evans,” she wrote. “Once again, these heroes risked their lives to protect our Capitol and our Country, with the same extraordinary selflessness and spirit of service seen on January 6. On behalf of the entire House, we are profoundly grateful.”

The Evans home is tucked into a leafy cul-de-sac dotted with trees with white flowers. It appeared that the family had been preparing to celebrate Easter. On the concrete pathway that curved to the family’s front door, someone had drawn in chalk a large yellow cross, surrounded by shapes of different colors. In overall effect, it resembled a stained-glass window. And someone had arranged colorful gel letters — the kind made for children — to spell “HAPPY EASTER” across the glass front door.

AD

Capitol Police officers told a Washington Post reporter that the family was having a difficult time and would appreciate being given space to mourn in private.

Bob Epskamp, who lives four doors down from the family, said he met Evans about 12 years ago. He recalled Evans talking fondly of his two young children, adding that he was a “loving and caring father” who was as dedicated to his job as he was to his family.

AD

Epskamp, 91, said the last time he spoke with Evans was in January — in the days immediately after the insurrection at the Capitol.

“I told him I was glad he was fortunate enough not to be on duty that day,” Epskamp recalled.

Olga Baturina, 60, has lived more than a decade in the neighborhood. She said she never got to know Evans very well, only well enough to say “Hi” when they passed each other on the sidewalk. But she said there was one thing that she’ll never forget: the way his children’s faces lit up with joy every time they saw Evans driving into the neighborhood.

AD

“His children, they just love him, they are always so happy to see him,” she said. Every time she glimpsed a reunion, “everyone was smiling.”

AD

Beth Terranova, an extended relative of Evans, recalled that he was a Star Wars fanatic — owning myriad collectibles including Christmas ornaments related to the franchise. He also enjoyed online gaming in his spare time, and hailing from Massachusetts, rooted deeply for Boston’s sports teams.

“He was a great dad and very dedicated police officer,” said Terranova, 65.

Near the Capitol, D.C. residents Hallie Harper, 30, and Peter Devine, 34, turned their daily walk around the building into a chance to stop for a moment of silent tribute to the fallen officer. They paused on Independence Avenue NE, looking at the lawn where this time last year, they had an Easter picnic with friends.

Noah Green, who was in his early 20s, was remembered as a stalwart defensive back on the Christopher Newport University football team before he slid into deep religiousness and paranoia that left family and friends concerned about his mental state in recent years.

Family and friends said he blamed former teammates and roommates for drugging him with Xanax in 2019, which one teammate said most people regarded as unmoored from reality. Noah Green felt the episode left him addicted to the drug and suffering withdrawal symptoms.

Noah Green moved out into his own apartment in Newport News, but he continued to suffer hallucinations, heart palpitations, headaches and suicidal thoughts that could have been related to drugs or mental illness, his brother said.

Brendan Green saw bruises and scars on his brother’s body.

“He was really paranoid from that point moving forward,” Toran said.

Damian Jiggetts, 22, said Green was a model student-athlete at CNU who showed no signs of mental health struggles or other issues.

“He was a stand-up guy,” said Jiggetts, who graduated last year. “He was on the dean’s list. He was a motivator. That was the Noah I knew and regardless of what happened today, that is what his legacy should be. He should be remembered as a positive guy.”

Jiggetts said he first met Green when Green transferred to CNU. The two competed for minutes at the same position, safety, but Green was always encouraging.

A maglev would be a speedy option over protected land. But research and wildlife might suffer.,"A high-speed train that would take passengers from Washington to Baltimore in 15 minutes as an alternative to traffic-choked roads would cut through a swath of public land, raising alarms among researchers who say hundreds of acres of forests and sensitive areas would be destroyed.

The 40-mile superconducting system for the magnetic-levitation train, or maglev, would travel aboveground for up to nine of those miles, crossing or touching upon some of the leading federal research facilities in the country. The path includes the nation’s largest agricultural scientific installation and the only National Wildlife Refuge established to support research.

Proponents have pitched the maglev train as a travel alternative — the first step in a broader plan to expand high-speed rail across the Northeast Corridor. The proposal, which is meandering through a lengthy federal review process, has drawn mixed reactions but could get clearance to proceed as early as this year.

Its two proposed alignments — east and west of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway — would cut through woods and permanently alter parks, recreational facilities and wetlands. As many as 1,000 acres, including up to 328 acres of federal land, would be affected, according to a federal environmental review.

Viaducts and ancillary facilities, such as emergency exits and power substations, are planned on and adjacent to land that belongs to the National Park Service, NASA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Secret Service, the National Security Administration and Fort Meade.

Baltimore-Washington Rapid Rail, which is developing the system with sister company Northeast Maglev, said the line is planned as close to the parkway as possible to minimize bisecting large areas home to sensitive species and habitats.

The company said routes under consideration would have the least effect on homes and other private property, keeping the project economically feasible. Measures that include the replanting of trees would be established to reduce impacts, the project proponents said.

The plan calls for a 180-acre paved maintenance yard on public land. Environmentalists and wildlife experts say viaducts and the maintenance yard would mar the land, now a protected green splotch in the middle of the heavily populated Washington-Baltimore corridor.

“This is an Earth-built landscape millions of years in the making,” said Sam Droege, a wildlife biologist who has spent two decades conducting research in the area. “When you crush, excavate and finally smother this land with fill and concrete, you destroy forever an entire interlocked, respiring and breathing community, the home for thousands of organisms living deep in the soil up to the treetops. You don’t get it back.”

Disruptions for a protected refuge

The Baltimore-Washington corridor has been touted as the ideal location in the United States to bring maglev technology, which has been tested in Japan and China. It harnesses powerful magnetic forces that lift and propel trains at high speeds.

Trains between D.C. and Baltimore would travel as fast as 311 mph, proponents say.

When the Federal Railroad Administration issued a draft review of the project in January, it laid out economic and environmental effects of the project, planned as the first leg of a rail system that would carry passengers between Washington and New York in an hour.

Amid opposition from civic associations and elected officials in the project’s path — and after more than a year of delays — the FRA is nearing completion of a review that could lead to tunneling as early as next year. The train could begin operating by 2030.

The project would cost between $13.8 billion and $16.8 billion, the federal agency said. It noted potential disruptions to businesses and property along the route but also up to $10.6 billion in wages to workers over seven years of construction.

The maglev train would help cut greenhouse gas emissions, taking about 16 million car trips off the road annually by 2045, according to the FRA.

But it also would run through the edge of public terrain that has been guarded for decades.

The project’s federal environmental reports describe a viaduct trekking through wooded sections parallel to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and a maintenance facility that would cut down trees and require fill to meet level grade requirements. One possible site for the train yard, along Maryland Route 198, would require a reroute of the Little Patuxent River.

Northeast Maglev disputes assertions from environmental advocates that the train would destroy green spaces. The company said its facilities are planned largely on previously disturbed land and points to other nonagricultural uses in the area, including Secret Service training camps, NASA operations and a nearby Metro maintenance yard.

Scientists and environmental activists, however, say they fear the project’s route would remove native plants and animals, breaking apart a space that serves as a refuge for thousands of migrating birds.

Audubon Maryland-D.C., a subsidiary of the nonprofit conservation National Audubon Society, sent a mass email calling on its members to oppose the project.

“It’s noteworthy that this is not public transportation,” the email said. “There are no stops between Baltimore and Washington and the train would cater to only the city’s most wealthy residents.”

The expected average fare would be $60 for a one-way trip, although it could vary between $27 and $80 per trip, project documents indicate. The train would make three stops: the District, Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport and Baltimore.

The project’s environmental reports conclude that construction “would result in irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources,” and that “resources considered scarce or rare, such as ecologically sensitive areas and historic resources are of particular concern.”

[Maryland towns ready to fight maglev project as federal review stalls]

Wayne Rogers, chief executive of Northeast Maglev and Baltimore-Washington Rapid Rail, said those phrases are not unique to the maglev project.

“It is boilerplate language,” Rogers said, noting that under federal law, environmental reviews must include details of any “irreversible” impacts on resources. “Pointing to it as a conclusion is misleading.”

On a list of items that would be damaged, the FRA lists ecologically sensitive areas and water resources, including wetlands, streams and floodplains on undeveloped land owned by the federal government.

‘Taking a conservation area’

The maglev train would travel in a tunnel in the District, avoiding densely populated communities. It would emerge in Prince George’s County near the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center — the world’s largest agricultural research complex.

Moving north, it would cross parts of the Patuxent Research Refuge, a 12,750-acre safe haven for more than 270 species of birds and other wildlife. It would pass near NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and touch upon U.S. Secret Service and National Security Agency property before returning to a tunnel at Fort George G. Meade. The maglev would then continue north in a tunnel toward BWI and into its terminus in either downtown or south Baltimore.

By keeping the train line aboveground in much of the midsection of the route, Baltimore-Washington Rapid Rail would save billions of dollars. Tunneling costs nearly three times more than building above ground, the Northeast Maglev said.

A full underground train line would require more ancillary facilities needed to support train operations, such as emergency exits, which would be located about every 3½ miles in tunneled sections.

Maryland Del. Geraldine Valentino-Smith (D-Prince George’s), who represents sections of the proposed route near the Patuxent Research Refuge, said the region’s public resources shouldn’t bear the brunt for a business seeking profits.

“They chose to come above ground and spend most of the time above ground in Prince George’s County on a purely economic basis, because it was less costly than building it underground,” Valentino-Smith said. “I have serious concerns and reservations. It’s purely for profit motive.”

[Officials have settled on 2 possible routes for the high-speed maglev, but project is still years away]

Project developers would need to acquire the property for the maintenance yard and the route, most of it from the federal government, a process that probably would require congressional action. That process will not be determined until a final route is selected.

Project officials say their preferred alignment, on the east side of the Parkway, has the least impact, cutting through woods and affecting about 80 acres in three public parks instead of up to seven parks in the west alignment.

That route would cross public woodlands in the north end of Patuxent Research Refuge, taking roughly 24 acres. There, the viaduct and ancillary facilities would enter an area used for hunting and conservation programs and cross part of a trail system that provides fishing access to Blue Heron Pond.

“You can squish all this and don’t have a people problem, at least in terms of taking down houses,” Droege, the wildlife biologist, said during a recent visit to the refuge. “But it is a problem when you are taking a conservation area that has endangered species, has endangered habitats.”

The maintenance facility has been reduced in size to 180 acres from the original 235-acre footprint. It would provide train storage, maintenance shops, factory and repair shops, cleaning facilities, train inspection facilities and offices. A road grid to access the facility, including to handle heavy machinery during construction, also would be built.

Northeast Maglev’s preferred location for a yard is the west side of the agricultural research center on forested land between Powder Mill Road and Odell Road. Construction and operation of the facility at that location or another area on the east side would be inconsistent with Prince George’s County plans, which seek to keep the agricultural research center as a natural area.

Northeast Maglev, however, notes that in the footprint of the western site, there are more than a dozen “derelict buildings” the USDA is planning to demolish. Building the train yard there would require up to 56 feet of fill to raise to the site.

Public benefits on public lands

The Department of Agriculture declined to comment on the proposal, as did the Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which are under the Interior Department. The agencies said their departments will comment on the project before a comment period closes May 24. Public hearings are scheduled this month.

NASA cited “detrimental impacts” of placing the maintenance facility at the USDA site east of the Parkway, which would be near the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory in Greenbelt.

“Any impacts from the [superconducting maglev] project on our science and mission would be of great concern,” Beth Montgomery, a NASA official, wrote to federal and state transportation officials last summer. She cited disruptions to “a number of NASA activities that require minimal disturbances from vibration, artificial lighting and electromagnetic interference.”

The NASA site near an old paved airfield has systems that track satellites, measure the Earth’s rotation and “establish a global reference point that is used to accurately determine the orbits of satellites and geolocate their Earth observations.” The site also hosts optical telescopes, an X-Ray beam line and neutron spectroscopy experiments, Montgomery said.

Although other locations were considered for a train yard outside the federal properties, project officials said those weren’t suitable. The alternatives, they said, would have required facilities across a number of sites, potentially having a greater effect on operations and nearby communities.

[In crisis, Amtrak is focused on testing and training for new trains to debut in 2021]

Northeast Maglev officials said the route’s midsection is ideal for the maintenance yard because it is between the two end stations, which would reduce travel time for night maintenance and other uses.

Rogers noted the area already is bisected by the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, there are more than 6,000 acres of land and parts of the agricultural research land already is used for other purposes.

Metro has a 75-acre rail yard that was formerly part of the research area and the Secret Service runs a training facility there, which Rogers said “includes an active gun range with noise of gunfire frequently the loudest noise impact.”

Critics say those uses are for the benefit of the public, including Metro, which receives public funding. Maglev officials countered that their service also would bring a public benefit.

Stephanie Kaufman, a Friends of Patuxent board member, said handing out federal property to a private developer would set a bad precedent of exploiting public land, parts of which are popular for hiking, biking and birdwatching.

“If you allow this, that opens the door to other requests. And how would you say it’s okay for maglev, but it’s not okay for the person who wants to put a landfill there?” she said.

"Andrew Cuomo declared the pandemic a ‘no-politics zone.’ Behind the scenes, he worked to burnish his own standing.","A few hours later, an administration aide was instructed to print a list of poll questions for the governor to approve before they went into the field the next day, according to documents reviewed by The Washington Post.

The survey would quiz New Yorkers on whether they supported sending emergency medical equipment downstate, when schools and businesses should reopen and whether Cuomo had been “too cooperative, too hostile, or just about right” in dealing with Trump on the pandemic, among other topics, according to a copy obtained by The Post.

The poll also sought to measure how voters assessed Cuomo’s handling of the coronavirus four weeks into the public health emergency compared with the handling by Trump, national infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), among others, the documents show.

The poll was among a number of moves Cuomo made to assess and bolster his political standing, even as his state was engulfed in the first deadly wave of the pandemic, according to documents and people familiar with the governor’s office, underscoring how consumed he was with burnishing his image amid one of the most acute moments of the crisis.

Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo spokesman, said in a statement that understanding public opinion was “very important in managing COVID because success would be determined by the public’s understanding of the severity of the crisis and their willingness to change behavior.”

The New York governor, a third-term Democrat, rose to stardom last spring with his fierce denunciations of Trump, his no-nonsense approach at his news briefings and his occasional criticisms of other politicians who were not following public health guidance. He was embraced as a liberal hero and regularly railed against political interference by others in the response to the pandemic, holding New York as a beacon of medical light during a time of national darkness.

Cuomo’s approval ratings surged to 66 percent by July, according to the Marist College poll in New York. “He had record-breaking numbers in New York because he was filling a void that you had in Washington,” said Lee Miringoff, the head of the poll.

In recent weeks, that record has been shadowed by allegations that his administration withheld the number of deaths in nursing homes linked to the coronavirus — a matter now under federal investigation — and revelations that Cuomo’s family members benefited from preferential coronavirus testing.

Cuomo’s poll numbers have also dropped, though he remains around 50 percent approval in New York among all voters, according to a recent survey by Marist.

AD

“You see some of it eroding away,” Miringoff said. “It’s really a one-two punch.”

Azzopardi dismissed what he called a “retrospective kerfuffle” about the administration’s coronavirus response.

“New York’s COVID performance is indisputable as we went from one of the highest infection rates to one of the lowest, facing a much worse problem than any state and successfully managed it,” he said. “There is no question that the Governor’s daily briefings served New Yorkers and other Americans very well during the pandemic and that has been recognized internationally.”

'Forget the Politics, Get Smart!'

As Cuomo was touting the state’s response publicly, behind the scenes, the governor at times blurred political tasks with state resources, as did some key staffers in his office, according to documents reviewed by The Post and people with knowledge of the situation. They and others interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.

AD

AD

The governor asked a number of advisers, including top state officials, to spend scores of hours to help write a book about his leadership during the pandemic as the coronavirus raged through the state, according to four people.

The New York Times reported that Cuomo was offered more than $4 million for the book, titled “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” which was released in October. A person familiar with the book proposal said one offer exceeded that.

The governor’s office declined to comment on how much he received for the book, adding that he annually releases a financial disclosure form and tax returns.

A number of his aides disagreed with the decision to write a book during the pandemic, saying it could be viewed as inappropriately timed and political, two people said.

AD

AD

One person who was key to the project was top Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa, who regularly appeared at coronavirus briefings with the governor. She was most involved in writing the book with him, while also running the governor’s office, people familiar with the matter said.

Other aides who worked in the governor’s office were asked to print drafts of the book on government computers, according to the people with knowledge of the situation.

Azzopardi said Cuomo decided to write the book because “the governor believed it was important to chronicle the first 111 days of the pandemic when the numbers had gone down but we were facing a potential second wave in order to reflect on past challenges and improve upon our response moving forward.”

AD

He said it was “not true” that aides said at the time that the project was not a good idea.

“To the extent that any state officials advised the Governor on the book it was voluntary, in compliance with state ethics laws and done on their personal time,” Azzopardi said, adding: “Every effort was made to ensure that no state resources were used in connection with this project — to the extent an aide printed out a document, it appears incidental.”

Cuomo sought to buttress his image at key moments of the crisis with unorthodox ideas, such as having a whimsical poster titled “NEW YORK TOUGH” released last summer that depicted the state’s response.

AD

Azzopardi said the governor’s campaign paid for the poster, which featured drawings of Cuomo’s family members, medical charts, a large mountain and the command: “Forget the Politics, Get Smart!”

AD

Stephanie Benton, director of the governor’s office, was involved in helping shepherd the project, documents show.

Using her Gmail account, Benton emailed herself a draft version of the poster last June, then asked another person to print it on a state computer and deliver it to the governor. She sent the artist who drew the poster a number of requests from the governor, including that it prominently feature him, the documents show.

“He also wants to add himself in a dodge charger on right side,” the email from Benton said, adding: “Thank you so much! He’s pumped :).”

Azzopardi said the poster was “designed by the governor, working with an artist” and was another way to communicate the message about the pandemic.

Other documents that aides to the governor were asked to print included detailed biographies on allies and donors — including how much money they’d given to the governor — and a range of polls, according to people familiar with the materials. Cuomo commissioned polls frequently, gauging public opinion on topics such as whether New Yorkers believe the governor or mayor controls the region’s transportation system, whether marijuana should be legalized or whether Democrats would support primary challengers for leftist candidates, documents show.

AD

AD

Azzopardi said the governor’s office is permitted to “maintain an integrated schedule and briefing binder that has the governor’s official as well as political events” and that Cuomo benefits from understanding public opinion.

State law generally bars public officials from using their position to “secure unwarranted privileges” for themselves, including the misappropriation to themselves of the “services or other resources of the state for private business or other compensated nongovernmental purposes.”

In a training document for state employees, the state’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics lists examples of prohibited behavior, including “using the computer in your office after work to produce a brochure in support of a candidate’s campaign.” Another example: using state Internet connections to “forward e-mail messages received from a partisan campaign or someone supporting a partisan candidate.”

AD

“In general, it would be improper for a public official to require a public employee on their own time and using public resources to aid a public official’s private venture,” said Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor.

'Making him look good'

Cuomo was determined that other New York politicians — particularly his rival de Blasio, the New York mayor — not receive positive headlines for the virus response, according to five people familiar with the matter.

During one point early in the pandemic, state workers were told to spend the weekend hastily arranging an antibody testing program, because the governor needed to announce it on a Sunday.

The impetus, two of these people said, was that state officials had learned that New York City was going to announce a program of its own.

Azzopardi said the state was “standing up testing in every corner of the state.”

“What a locality was doing is irrelevant,” he added.

At another point early in the pandemic, after de Blasio announced that the federal government had deployed ambulances to help an overwhelmed New York City, Cuomo angrily told federal officials to share resources with the state, not the city, people familiar with the calls said.

Azzopardi said he was not aware of the episode.

An early draft of Cuomo’s book included a jeremiad against the New York mayor. “He is like Trump in many ways that it is politics all the time, facts be damned,” Cuomo wrote, according to a copy obtained by The Post. He was ultimately dissuaded by aides from including it in the final version, people familiar with the matter said.

Several City Hall officials said they stopped telling Cuomo’s team what they were planning to do in advance, because he would often try to preempt or squash the announcement.

“Andrew Cuomo’s obsession with optics has consistently gotten in the way of the fight against COVID,” Bill Neidhardt, a de Blasio spokesman, said in a statement. “It’s disturbing to think of all the staff time and taxpayer money wasted on a book of petty insults just so he could declare victory midway through the second quarter.”

Azzopardi said the governor “went to great lengths to work cooperatively with the mayor,” adding: “As everyone knows, the relationship has not been ideal.”

Current and former administration officials said Cuomo was intensely focused on how much attention his coronavirus briefings were drawing, asking aides about when national TV networks were cutting away and discussing how he could keep them tuned in longer and improve his ratings.

“Monitoring how the press is carrying a government official’s announcements — particularly during a pandemic when messaging was crucial to the state’s response — is a key function of any press office,” Azzopardi said.

Meanwhile, key health department officials who complained they were sidelined from decisions joked grimly among themselves that they needed to watch the daily news conferences to learn what policies they were going to have to implement, former officials said.

After the briefings, health officials scrambled to draft guidance on issues such as reopening certain industries, high school graduation protocols and mask-wearing to try to match what the governor had already announced, according to people familiar with the matter. Many of the decisions were made with little public health guidance, they said.

“We would watch the press conference so we could see what we were going to have to do next,” a person with direct knowledge of the effort said. “We would see the metrics, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4, this industry, that industry, and we’d have no input in it. Then we’d try to execute whatever it said. We learned when the public learned.”

A second person with knowledge of the operation said: “We would listen to find out what the policy was on schools, on microclusters, mask-wearing, on everything, and then we would retrofit any kind of guidance that was needed.”

Over the course of a year, more than a dozen senior health officials, including many who worked on key parts of the pandemic, had quit rather than continue dealing with Cuomo and his staff, four people familiar with the matter said.

One former official said the governor and his aides would regularly berate department staffers if they pushed back against the direction Cuomo wanted to take: “It was all about making him look good.”

In a statement, Azzopardi said “managing COVID was highly stressful for all, time was of the essence, and many people in many health departments across the country either left or were fired due to the stress and demands of the pandemic.”

“To the extent that DOH officials needed to watch the presser to understand policy, that is correct,” he added. “The health commissioner was involved in day-to-day policy decisions in a morning meeting that was publicly announced later that morning. Policy shifts did happen on a daily basis as the facts on the ground about the pandemic changed on a daily basis.”

One decision the Cuomo administration made in early April 2020 — to relocate medical equipment from upstate facilities for use in New York City hospitals — drew backlash from some officials and hospitals upstate, who accused Cuomo of leaving residents “without protection.” Within days, the governor backed away from the idea, saying the need had diminished.

In the aftermath, Cuomo’s political team sought to gauge public support for such a move through the poll it commissioned from Global Strategy Group, a Democratic firm, documents show.

The draft survey obtained by The Post asked whether New Yorkers would support “moving medical equipment, like ventilators, from upstate hospitals and health care facilities to the epicenter of the pandemic downstate with the promise of returning them upstate if and when they are needed?”

The poll also sought to measure public opinion on a range of policy positions, including where hospital relief money should go, whether social distancing was a good concept, how economic aid should be spent and what businesses should open before others.

And it included several questions aimed to assess Cuomo’s own standing.

Canada’s variant-fueled covid-19 surge prompts new restrictions,"“We’re very concerned with the variants becoming an increasing proportion of cases,” Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, said on Thursday, imploring Canadians to not gather in person with those who live in other households.

Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations had fallen sharply and plateaued at a high level since peaking in January, but the trend has reversed, even as vaccinations roll out. The seven-day average of cases rose to 5,086 on March 31, up 40 percent from the week before and 72 percent from the beginning of the month, according to data from Canada’s public health agency.

Other worrying trends are proliferating. The number of variant cases in the country on March 31 was 70 percent higher than the previous week. British Columbia recorded its highest number of daily cases this week. Ontario has never had more coronavirus patients in intensive care.

Across the country, public health officials and infectious-disease experts are reporting that the patients who are hospitalized with more severe illness are younger than during previous surges. The ages of younger people infected varies across the country, but generally they are under age 60.

“As the new variants spread, you will see that covid-19 is killing faster and younger,” Adalsteinn Brown, co-chair of a panel of scientists advising Ontario Premier Doug Ford, said Thursday as he unveiled new modeling for the province. “It’s spreading far more quickly than it was before, and we cannot vaccinate quickly enough to break this third wave.”

Alyson Kelvin, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine Infectious Disease Organization, said the young could be replacing the old in hospitals because many of the elderly who once were the most vulnerable have been vaccinated, the young are essential workers and the variants are causing more severe illness.

“The variants are playing by different rules,” she said.

British Columbia, which had previously drawn praise for its handling of the pandemic, announced on Monday that it would shut down indoor dining at bars and restaurants, worship services and indoor group fitness classes for three weeks. Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer, said variants were fueling the surge.

The Whistler Blackcomb ski resort was also ordered closed. Officials said it has been the site of a “worrisome” cluster of cases of the P.1 variant, first identified in Brazil. Some 83 percent of cases in Whistler were people ages 20 to 39, according to figures from Vancouver Coastal Health.

Quebec imposed strict curbs this week in several areas that recently had restrictions eased, including the closure of schools, theaters, gyms, hair salons and nonessential businesses for 10 days. Officials rolled back a 9:30 p.m. curfew in those areas to 8 p.m. and imposed capacity limits at places of worship.

“People essentially have to stay at home, unless they absolutely need to go to work,” Quebec Premier François Legault said.

In neighboring Ontario, Ford lifted a stay-at-home order for much of the province in February despite warnings from the panel advising him that it would lead to an increase in cases. On Thursday, he pulled what he called a provincewide “emergency brake,” closing indoor and outdoor dining and imposing capacity limits on businesses, weddings and funerals.

The restrictions are less stringent than the measures that the province implemented in December, which included the closure of nonessential businesses and schools.

Brown, who is also dean of the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, painted a bleak picture of the province’s strained intensive care units based on what he had heard from front-line health-care workers.

“Whole families are now showing up in intensive care,” he said. “We have to separate families in ambulances and helicopters and move them to other regions that have a spare bed. … [One] family ended up spread between three cities in three different hospitals, and all of them died.”

Laveena Munshi, a critical-care physician at Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital, said many patients in her hospital’s ICUs are essential workers. She said they are often from low socioeconomic backgrounds and worry they might miss paychecks if they have to stay home to get tested or if they are unwell.

AD

Munshi, who is also part of the panel advising the government, said the new restrictions in Ontario are unlikely to do much to break those chains of transmission.

“The pandemic has really unmasked the major inequalities that were preexisting in our health-care system,” she said. “A measure like paid sick leave is really something that we would hope that the government would consider employing.”

Canada’s coronavirus trends mirror those seen elsewhere, including in parts of the United States and in several European countries, where cases also have risen sharply, hospitals are under strain and governments are imposing new restrictions on social gatherings, businesses and schools.

Canada’s vaccine rollout got off to a slow start, hamstrung in part by a lack of domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity and delays importing doses from abroad. It has picked up pace in recent weeks, but Canada still lags many peers.

AD

As of April 1, Canada had administered 15.6 doses per 100 people, according to Oxford University’s Our World in Data, about one-third the figure in the United States. Less than 2 percent of people in Canada have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.

In Alberta, which delayed moving into the next phase of its reopening plan amid rising case counts, Premier Jason Kenney said this week that “in the race between vaccines and variants of covid-19, the variants are winning.”

The rollout has had bright spots, particularly in long-term care homes, which were prioritized for vaccines after having been devastated by outbreaks that were responsible for at least 69 percent of Canada’s coronavirus deaths, according to a report from the Canadian Institute for Health Information.

AD

Data from Ontario last month showed that vaccination had reduced the relative risk of infection and death in residents of those facilities by an estimated 89 percent and 96 percent, respectively, compared to a control group of the unvaccinated elderly living outside those settings. Other areas reported similar findings.

“It is discouraging to have so few vaccines and such little coverage,” Kelvin said. “But we’re going through a vaccine ramp up right now … so I’m hopeful that we will be able to get some sort of containment in the near future.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Nearly 20 arrested in alleged plot against Jordan’s King Abdullah II,"The move followed the discovery of what officials described as a complex and far-reaching plot that included at least one other Jordanian royal as well as tribal leaders and members of the country’s political and security establishment. One official cited unspecified evidence of “foreign” backing for the plan.

Biden administration officials were briefed on the arrests, which come at a time of heightened economic and political tension in a country long regarded as a bulwark of stability and an essential partner in U.S.-led counterterrorism operations.

Additional arrests were expected, said the intelligence official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing security sensitivities surrounding the law enforcement operation.

In a formal statement late Saturday, the Jordanian Armed Forces confirmed that multiple arrests had occurred and that Hamzah had been “asked to cease all movements or activities that could be employed to target Jordan’s security and stability.” The statement said that the former crown prince had not been arrested but that “comprehensive investigations” were underway.

In Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price said U.S. officials were closely following the reports and were in touch with Jordanian officials. “King Abdullah is a key partner of the United States, and he has our full support,” Price said.

Hamzah served as Jordan’s crown prince for four years before the title was transferred to the current monarch’s eldest son, Hussein, in 2004. He has held multiple positions within the monarchy, including in the army, where he holds the rank of brigadier. He commands a loyal following in Amman and, with his trim mustache and checkered headdress, often styles himself after the late King Hussein, a revered figure in Jordan.

The prince was informed of the investigation by Jordanian military officers who arrived at his house with an escort of guards, as arrests were getting underway elsewhere, the intelligence official said. Hamzah was told to refrain from travel and from posting on social media, the intelligence official said.

It was unclear how close the alleged plotters were to carrying out the supposed plan, or what, exactly, was intended. The intelligence official described the plan as “well-organized” and said some of the plotters appeared to have “foreign ties,” though he did not elaborate on that point.

The arrests of other officials were reported by Jordanian news outlets. Among them was Sharif Hasan, who also is a member of the royal family, and Bassem Awadullah, a former senior official in Jordan’s Royal Hashemite Court. An investment banker and CEO of Tomoh Advisory, a consultant firm based in Dubai, Awadullah had also served as special Jordanian representative to the Saudi government, and held Jordanian and Saudi passports, the intelligence official said.

In Israel, where news of the possible coup plot emerged at the end of the Passover holiday, officials had no immediate comment. But Israel, which has had a peace treaty with Jordan since 1994, considers stability in Amman as vital to Israel’s national interest. The two share Israel’s longest border, and Israel looks to Jordan to provide a buffer against threats from Iran.

“If this turns out to have been a serious attempt, it would be of a great deal of concern,” said Chuck Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security adviser. “Israel takes the stability of the Hashemite Kingdom extremely seriously. They are a close security relationship.”

Jordan has been hit hard economically by the coronavirus pandemic as well as by the fallout from massive waves of refugees from Syria, its northern neighbor. Abdullah has ruled the country since King Hussein’s death in 1999, and cultivated close ties with a succession of U.S. presidents, while also clashing at times with U.S. officials over Palestinian peace initiatives. In recent years, he sparred with Trump administration officials over plans that would essentially bypass the Palestinians in seeking to redraw the boundaries of a future Palestinian state.

After Georgia signed into law its Election Integrity Act, which critics say disproportionately affects voting access for people of color, corporations this week came under pressure to speak out before similar bills introduced in nearly every state are passed.

Most of the corporate criticism of the Georgia law came after it was passed, despite weeks of call-outs and demonstrations from activists leading up to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature on March 25.

In addition to condemning voting proposals in dozens of states, activists want companies to testify in front of legislators, withdraw financial support from lawmakers who support them, and throw weight behind federal election reform legislation.

“We want them to lobby senators about passing the currently pending bill and use their forces to lobby that just as aggressively as they would to advance their own corporate interests,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder and executive director of national community organizing group Black Voters Matter. “At the end of the day, democracy is in their business interest.”

They are also looking beyond Georgia.

Texas is the next battleground for activists, where the largest number of restrictive bills (49 as of March 24) have been introduced in the state legislature. One of them — Senate Bill 7, which would ban overnight early voting and drive-through early voting — passed in the Senate and moved to the state House on Thursday morning. The House is considering its own voting bill, House Bill 6, which would prohibit election officials from sending absentee ballot applications to voters without their requests.

Dell chief executive Michael Dell said in a tweet Thursday that “governments should ensure citizens have their voices heard,” and the Texas House Bill 6 “does the opposite.” The Texas-based company declined to comment further.

As a Texas-based business, we must stand up for the rights of our team members and customers who call Texas home, and honor the sacrifices made by generations of Americans to protect and expand the right to vote.”

Albright was in the airport in Houston on Wednesday after participating in protests at AT&T’s Dallas headquarters over the state’s proposed legislation when he stopped to watch a CNBC segment featuring Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier and former American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault, who coordinated a letter signed by 72 Black business executives calling on companies to fight voting bills propelled by Republican lawmakers in at least 43 states after Georgia’s law was passed.

“This wasn’t just a fluff segment,” Albright said. “They had a substantive conversation about the letter, about the law, about what the expectations are for the corporate community. It was passionate. It wasn’t a hostage video. It wasn’t a statement you made because you had to.”

Republican lawmakers have proposed at least 361 bills in at least 47 states that would restrict access to mail, early in-person and Election Day voting, according to data compiled as of March 24 by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.

Civic Alliance first started considering a sign-on letter for its members late last week, but the Black executives’ letter is what “really tipped the scales,” said Mike Ward, the group’s co-founder. The statement “literally had a call in it — we call on our fellow executives and business leaders to join,” Ward said. Within eight hours on Thursday, about 10 percent of the organization’s roughly 1,070 member companies had decided to sign on, and Ward expects that number to continue rising.

Ward said the organization has been getting dozens of calls and emails a day since the Georgia law was signed, and that it has worked with some companies to help them craft their statements. “It feels very much like November, instead of April of the year after” an election season, which is usually their busy time, Ward said.

Ward said he believes states where legislation has not yet passed will get increasing attention from corporations, and that companies are considering options beyond statements — things such as withholding contributions, lobbying on behalf of federal legislation, or speaking directly with lawmakers.

The bills have been propelled and applauded by the GOP, and some top elected officials have criticized the wave of corporate pushback. In a fiery attack on Delta Air Lines after CEO Ed Bastian condemned Georgia’s bill, Kemp said in a Fox News interview Thursday that companies will “have to answer to their shareholders.”

In a Thursday night statement, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick responded to American Airlines, saying: “Texans are fed up with corporations that don’t share our values trying to dictate public policy.”

Patrick added:. “The majority of Texans support maintaining the integrity of our elections, which is why I made it a priority this legislative session. Senate Bill 7 includes comprehensive reforms that will ensure voting in Texas is consistent statewide and secure.”

The Georgia voting law explained: Why Republicans insist it ‘expands access’,"But Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who signed the bill into law last month, insists the opposite.

“I’m telling you the truth about this bill,” Kemp insisted on WABE radio, Atlanta’s NPR affiliate, on Tuesday. “It expands access.”

AD

A close examination of the language in the law shows it does contain new restrictions on voting; some are likely to make it disproportionately more difficult for poorer voters and voters of color to cast their ballots.

AD

It’s also correct that there are ways in which the law expands voter access, particularly in ways that will be visible in rural areas.

The context is important of course: This is playing out in the wake of Georgia’s swing to Democrats in the 2020 presidential election and the ensuing baseless charges of fraud from the Trump campaign and its allies. Republican lawmakers in the state — as many of their counterparts across the country have — quickly began drafting a bill critics say is a political reaction from a party beholden to Trump.

AD

The other important context: The long history of suppressing Black votes.

So let’s look at what it does and doesn’t do.

How the new law limits voting

It shrinks the window for early and absentee voting. Rather than allowing voters to request ballots six months from Election Day, the new law says voters can start requesting ballots 78 days out; counties can begin sending ballots to voters just 29 days before Election Day, rather than the previous 49 days. Critics say any mail delays with these shorter periods could lead to voters not getting ballots on time, or not being able to return them in time. But proponents of the law say voters simply don’t need the 180 days they used to have to request ballots.

AD

AD

Counties and the state can send mail ballot applications only to voters who request them (as opposed to simply sending every registered voter a ballot) and cannot fill in information ahead of time.

New voter ID requirements. Voters who cast mail ballots will have to provide one of several forms of identification. This provision — which replaces a signature match previously used to confirm voters’ identities — is one of the most controversial because critics say it is likely to disproportionately affect Black voters.

A limit on the number of ballot drop boxes during early voting. It essentially limits the number of drop boxes in each county to one per early-voting site, or one for every 100,000 voters in the county, whichever number is smaller. And the drop boxes can’t be conveniently spread over the county, for example, in places where there aren’t in-person early-voting locations; they all have to be located either in a county election office or at an early-voting precinct location.

AD

AD

Shortened early voting in runoff elections. Instead of a minimum of three weeks of early voting in runoffs, early voting in runoffs will be held in a single Monday-Friday period.

State lawmakers get much more power over county and local elections (and Republicans have decisive majorities in both the state Senate and the state House). The law states that the General Assembly will select the chair of the state elections board, rather than the board being chaired by the Georgia secretary of state — an elected position. The chair is supposed to be nonpartisan. The state election board can investigate county election boards and has the power to suspend county election superintendents — though the law limits the state board to suspending four at a time.

You might remember Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who became the target of his own party’s ire after President Donald Trump asked him to “find” votes in the wake of the 2020 election; this provision seems like a direct reaction to that, ensuring partisan state lawmakers can control the election process more directly.

AD

AD

A ban on handing out food and water within 150 feet of a polling place, or within 25 feet of any voter. Republicans say this is aimed at stopping outside groups from influencing voters; Democrats say it’s supposed to make it harder for people to wait in long lines, particularly on hot or cold days. Election officials are permitted to set up water stations — but they’re not required to do so.

A few ways it expands voting:

A minimum number of drop boxes is guaranteed. Kemp has been arguing publicly that in rural counties that didn’t have drop boxes in previous elections, this is an improvement. While the number of drop boxes is so limited it might not make a huge difference for voters, Kemp is correct that the law for the first time codifies requirements for a minimum number of drop boxes in each county.

AD

AD

An additional day of early voting in most rural counties. The new bill requires at least two Saturdays of early voting for each primary and general election (previous Georgia law required only one). It allows counties to choose when their early-voting locations are open, for a minimum of eight hours a day between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.

More resources for precincts so lines don’t get too long. The law basically requires the state to monitor polling locations to see if any have lines longer than an hour, or still have voters waiting in line for more than an hour after polls were supposed to close. In those cases, the state is required to either form new precinct locations to ease the strain or beef up the existing polling locations’ capacity to handle large numbers of voters. This applies specifically to populous precincts, mostly in urban areas.

Here’s what didn’t make it into the bill:

A block on Sunday voting. Earlier proposals called for a ban on Sunday voting. This proposal was seen as directly targeting Black voters, who often vote as part of church-run “souls to the polls” efforts that take place on Sundays.

AD

AD

A ban on no-excuse absentee voting. Georgia Republicans actually passed a bill in the state Senate a few weeks ago that would have banned no-excuse absentee voting, one of the most criticized — but not uniformly agreed upon — GOP proposals in the lead-up to the final bill. A few key Georgia Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan (R), opposed the idea — and it was ultimately removed from the bill Kemp signed into law.

How does this compare to other states?

Kemp and other defenders of the law say what’s on the books now is in line with voting laws, even in blue states. Kemp cited Biden’s home state of Delaware in a Fox News interview Thursday, pointing to the ways Georgia allows more access.

AD

Georgia’s new voter ID requirement for mail ballots is one interesting comparison point. The state’s old system required a cumbersome — and some said unreliable — signature-matching process, and the new law replaces it with a requirement for a driver’s license, Social Security card or one of a number of other forms of ID prescribed by the state.

AD

That’s actually a little bit less strict than some of the strictest voter ID requirements in the country, where photo ID is required. Other states are closer to Georgia’s new law, requiring some kind of photo or non-photo ID, including a Social Security number. And among those are blue states including Delaware, Washington and Connecticut.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Police crackdowns of illicit massage businesses pose harms to the women they aim to help,"Police charged eight female spa workers with prostitution, according to local media outlets, which posted photos of their mug shots on the evening news.

In their efforts to rein in illicit massage businesses across the country, police sometimes rely on sting operations in which undercover officers engage in sex acts with spa workers, according to law enforcement experts and police records reviewed by The Post. While such tactics are generally permitted by law, policymakers are beginning to propose new limits on physical contact by police, which they say serves to dehumanize — and potentially traumatize — the very women the raids are purportedly meant to help. The spa owners and operators targeted by law enforcement, experts said, often go unpunished.

The incidents in Coweta County “stand out as both egregious and probably fairly typical,” said Erin Albright, an anti-trafficking expert who trains law enforcement agents on how to reform their policies to better support victims.

“I do not believe for a second that whatever the state’s interest might be justifies investigators getting naked and having the worker engage in physical contact of any sort,” she said.

Toby Nix, an investigator for the Coweta County Sheriff’s Office, said in an email that it is not agency policy or practice to take part “in any illegal or immoral activity.” However, in some circumstances, he said, “a serious attempt to engage in criminal activity must take place before an arrest can be made.” He declined to answer questions about the agency’s policies regarding physical contact in police operations, whether any officers violated those policies or if any trafficking charges were filed.

AD

AD

It is unclear exactly how often police engage in sex acts during these operations because no organization tracks them. In two recent examples, Department of Homeland Security agents allegedly engaged in sex acts with suspected trafficking victims in Arizona and a private investigator in Horry County, S.C., working on behalf of local officials, engaged in sexual encounters as part of an undercover investigation into massage businesses, according to media reports.

Such incidents are probably much more common than reported, said Shea Rhodes, co-founder of Villanova University’s Institute to Address Commercial Sexual Exploitation, because “the very people who would report it are the most vulnerable,” she said.

Paige Hughes, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an arm of DHS, said the conduct of a “limited number” of agents in the Arizona case “was not consistent with” the agency’s policy and had been referred to its office of professional responsibility for action.

AD

AD

A Horry County spokeswoman declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.

Advocates also see police stings as counterproductive: More often than not, they leave the spa workers with arrest records that can hurt their chances for employment, housing or other opportunities. Raids can be psychologically traumatizing to women and result in ongoing stress and fear, as well as distrust of law enforcement, said Grace Chang, a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara whose work focuses on human trafficking and immigrant women.

Some jurisdictions are beginning to consider stricter limits around physical contact by police, including prohibitions against skin-to-skin contact, as well as the verbal humiliation or degradation of sex workers. Officers are expressly barred from engaging in sexual intercourse during undercover stings in every state — Michigan became the last in 2017 — according to Bridgette Carr, founding director of the University of Michigan Law School’s Human Trafficking Clinic.

Others are going even further: Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby in late March said her office would no longer prosecute low-level offenses, including prostitution, because such charges tend to “criminalize mostly people of color.”

Concerns over the illicit massage industry and the plight of its workers gained urgency last month after tragedy unfolded in Georgia: A man fatally shot four people at a spa 30 minutes north of Atlanta, then killed four others at Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa in the city. The accused gunman told police he frequented two of the locations and viewed the female employees as “temptations” he needed to “eliminate.” The Post previously reported the spas had been the target of police stings years before the shootings, but there is no evidence that any of the victims were sex workers.

Investigators also are exploring racism as a possible motive for the attacks, which targeted Asian-owned businesses and claimed the lives of six Asian women. The harmful stereotype of Asian women as sexualized and subservient has been pervasive in American history and culture for more than a century.

There are more than 150,000 massage businesses in the United States, including storefronts and independent contractors, according to the Associated Bodywork & Massage Professionals, an industry group. The size of the illicit massage industry is difficult to measure and a matter of debate between anti-trafficking groups, who say there are 9,000 to 11,000 of those businesses in the United States, and advocates for sex workers, who contend those estimates are far too high.

AD

AD

Though many sex workers opt in by choice, experts say a portion of massage businesses force women to work under the threat of violence, deportation or financial ruin. Prosecuting such crimes is difficult because the victims often are afraid to talk to authorities and the owners of illicit spas commonly hide their identities under layers of shell companies, law enforcement experts said.

The Georgia attack raised questions over how to better regulate this industry. Anti-trafficking groups, including the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, are pressing for more targeted enforcement against sex-trafficking rings, which they contend have global reach, to help the women lured into working for them.

Other advocates say that further law enforcement intervention would do more harm, pointing to past efforts to police brothels that generally end with women — usually, women of color — in jail cells. Amy Farrell, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston, says society would be better served targeting the structural inequalities that might lead women to commercial sex work in the first place.

AD

AD

“We have framed human trafficking as a criminal issue, with nefarious offenders and innocent victims, but life is often more complicated than that,” Farrell said. “It requires that we think about commercial sex work as a form of labor, which is uncomfortable for some people.”

The Coweta County stings were part of an operation to combat sex trafficking that lasted from June 2019 to November 2020, Nix said in an email. Though authorities said they found no trafficking victims during the three initial raids, he said the broader investigation ultimately resulted in 79 arrests on charges “ranging from prostitution, pimping, weapons, drugs.” Nix said investigators also identified and assisted “several” victims of human trafficking, though he declined to provide details on what form that assistance took.

ICE agents took part in the raids to help determine whether any women were being trafficked, according to the police reports. Hughes, the agency spokeswoman, was “not aware of any ICE employee misconduct” in the Coweta County operation and said the agency was not involved in planning the stings.

AD

Zachary Gaeta, an attorney for one of the women arrested, said Coweta County prosecutors dropped all charges against his client because, they told him, they were embarrassed about the police conduct and didn’t want details of the incident coming to light. Still, he said, the woman was recently denied an apartment because the arrest showed up in her background check; her mug shot still appears next to a Google search for her name.

“You are still stuck with this stigma,” Gaeta said. “Even if you get the case dismissed, and get it wiped clean, it’s not completely clean.”

The three Coweta County spas were shut down after the stings and their former owners could not be reached for comment. Prosecutors involved in these cases did not respond to requests for comment.

The massage industry is governed by a patchwork of state and local regulations, with wide disparities and spotty enforcement. Many states have massage boards that have only the authority to license individual massage therapists, while the job of approving and revoking business licenses falls to local governments, said Craig Knowles, chairman of the massage board for the state of Georgia.

AD

Police busts may cause individuals to lose their licenses but rarely have much effect on the business owners, who can swap out those employees or reopen at a new location after a raid, according to law enforcement experts.

Workers advocates stress the importance of distinguishing between consensual sex work and trafficking. There are a variety of reasons people may work in the sex industry, they say. Some enjoy the work or have found it to be a good source of income, while others might be victims of abuse or exploitation.

But the criminalization of sex work — Nevada is the only state with legal brothels — discourages trafficking victims from coming forward because they fear prosecution, they said.

“When workers are excluded from even the minimal protections we have in the United States, they are easily exploited,” said Jean Bruggeman, executive director of Freedom Network USA, an alliance of human-trafficking survivors and advocates.

Sex trafficking is a common target for politicians who want to appear tough on crime and show compassion for victims. Since the early 2000s, when the first federal anti-human-trafficking laws were enacted, news releases and media reports have touted the number of arrests and “rescues” made during raids — though those numbers have in some cases been found to be inflated.

One of the largest early stings, Operation Gilded Cage, was a coordinated effort between federal and local authorities, including the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office, led at the time by Kamala D. Harris.

The nine-month effort, which culminated in 10 raids and 45 arrests at massage businesses in San Francisco and Los Angeles, was hailed by law enforcement as one of the nation’s largest prostitution busts: Agents seized $3 million and detained about 120 women at a military base, where they were questioned for 24 hours. While none of the defendants faced trafficking-related offenses, most were deported, according to Kathleen Kim, a professor at Loyola Law School who co-authored California’s anti-trafficking law and provided legal representation to the women arrested during the raid.

A spokeswoman for Vice President Harris declined to comment.

Many law enforcement agencies have no written policies that go beyond state bans on sexual intercourse and do not specify how much sexual contact is allowed by undercover officers in sting operations, police experts said. That ambiguity has allowed some law enforcement agents to engage in conduct that civil rights advocates view as abuse of power.

Police reports often downplay the level of sexual interaction that occurs during stings, and cameras are seldom used to record the interactions, said Joanna E. McClinton, a Democratic state representative in Pennsylvania and a former public defender. Although the women she represented in court often told her that police officers went much further than they had indicated in their reports, they usually didn’t feel comfortable bringing those concerns before a judge, she said.

“It’s one person’s word over the officer, and prosecutors would usually say these officers would never do anything like that,” she said.

Though several experts who reviewed the police report from the Coweta County raid believe some officers engaged in inappropriate physical contact, there was more debate about a series of stings the Atlanta Police Department conducted from 2008 to 2013 at a cluster of businesses 20 minutes north of downtown: Gold Spa, Aromatherapy Spa, Spring Spa, St. Jame Spa and Fuji Spa.

Plainclothes policemen repeatedly visited these businesses and paid women for massages, then agreed to pay for sex acts, according to police reports obtained by The Post through public records requests. In at least nine incidents, officers did not initiate the arrest until after the women began touching them sexually, the records say — even though legal experts say verbal agreement alone is sufficient cause for arrest under Georgia law.

In six of those nine cases, the officers were negotiating the price of sexual services when the women were touching them, according to the records, which included written accounts from the officers themselves. In at least two incidents, sexual contact continued after a verbal deal was reached, records show. In one case, it was unclear whether any transaction was discussed. In all cases, records show the arrests appeared to occur shortly after contact turned physical, but in no case was the length of the physical contact described.

The women appeared to be living at the spas, said John Brock, a retired sergeant and a former supervisor of the Atlanta vice squad when it carried out some of the stings. Most of the women told investigators little about their circumstances, but a few said their passports had been withheld while they worked off debts incurred coming to this country, he said. They were referred to federal immigration authorities because police were investigating prostitution, not human trafficking, Brock said.

No evidence of legal action against the spa owners could be found in public records. The owners of Gold Spa, Aromatherapy Spa and Spring Spa and former owners of the shuttered St. Jame Spa and Fuji Spa could not be reached for comment.

Police repeated the routine — raid, arrest, interrogate — over and over, busting the same businesses and sometimes the same women, the records show. From 2008 to 2013, the city’s vice squad conducted at least 54 stings at the five spas, making a total of 108 arrests. “When it was raining, the prostitutes on the street weren’t out, so we would hit the spas,” Brock said.

Brock denied that officers engaged in sex acts. Rather, he said, the women had been “pushing the issue” of sex, including touching the officers sexually before they could stop them. He said he could not speak to operations that occurred after he retired in 2011.

Sgt. John Chafee, a spokesman for the Atlanta police, said in a statement that “it was extremely common for someone engaging in prostitution to begin touching their potential customer while negotiating the specifics of the deal. Immediately stopping them would increase suspicion they were an undercover officer and potentially place them in danger.”

Four legal experts interviewed by The Post said arrests can be made without sexual contact. “In order to have prostitution, you have to exchange money for sex,” said Brad Rideout, a defense attorney who has worked on cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct by law enforcement agents. “Officers should not have sex with suspects in any investigation or use any sort of sexual touching, fondling or any use of sexual organs to solve a crime,” he said.

“Touching is not required in prostitution cases,” said Loyola’s Kim.

Atlanta police arrested dozens of women for prostitution or operating without a massage license during the stings, according to records. The Post attempted to contact the women named in the reports and was unable to reach them. None of the officers named in the reports responded to requests for comments.

Although vice units are still common in police departments across the country, Atlanta police disbanded its vice squad in 2015 to put more focus on violent crimes and take a more “victim centered approach” to the sex business, spokesman Chafee said in his statement. Based on an initial review, he said, the vice squad incident reports from 2008 to 2013 “do not raise concerns that would warrant opening an investigation and no operational changes are needed as the department no longer engages in these types of operations.”

Law enforcement officials say they’ve shifted course to place more emphasis on helping — rather than apprehending — victims of trafficking. “The culture is changing,” said John Eisert, an assistant director for U.S. Homeland Security Investigations. “We are starting to recognize that these women are victims.”

Eisert said HSI identified and assisted 418 survivors of sex trafficking last year, including some who worked for massage businesses. The agency gives the women shelter when necessary and assigns them “continued presence” immigration status, which allows them to stay in the country to work, he said.

Investigators say some illicit massage businesses are part of sprawling criminal enterprises that can span dozens of establishments and several states. But authorities struggle to identify the operators of these networks because they go to extremes to distance themselves from the storefront businesses, said Camila Zolfaghari, a former prosecutor of sex trafficking in Georgia who is now an executive director of the anti-trafficking group Street Grace.

“They do not look like criminals,” Zolfaghari said. “Often they are very successful businessmen, they are property owners, they work collaboratively with other businessmen to invest in, to own, to exploit people in these illicit spas while protecting themselves from law enforcement.”

In 2018, anti-trafficking group Polaris researched 6,000 illicit massage businesses and found only 28 percent had an actual person’s name listed on the business registration.

In February, the U.S. attorney for Minnesota said authorities had extradited Sumalee Intarathong, a 59-year-old Thai woman accused of running an operation that lured hundreds of women from Thailand to the United States with the promise of a job in the massage industry. Prosecutors say Intarathong and her associates effectively “owned” these women, who were forced into prostitution to pay off “bondage debt” that ran from $40,000 to $60,000, according to her indictment.

Prosecutors have said one key to taking down the operation and convicting 36 co-conspirators was identifying the financial apparatus behind it. The organization dealt mostly in cash and engaged in money laundering to conceal illegal profits, the indictment said. The women opened bank accounts that were controlled by the criminal organization while “house bosses” collected portions of the women’s earnings and sent them back to traffickers, prosecutors alleged. Intarathong was arrested in Belgium in 2016; her lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

The complexity of such organizations is a powerful shield against prosecution, especially if investigators have to cross state lines and persuade multiple agencies to join the effort, Zolfaghari said. The traffickers often benefit, she said, “from a lack of focus and a lack of resources,” on the part of law enforcement.

Rather than go after traffickers, some cities and states have turned their attention to culling demand for sexual services — arresting the men who frequent such establishments. Even so, advocates say, there are few consequences for the men who buy sex.

In a high-profile case two years ago, more than two dozen men — including Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots — were charged with soliciting prostitution in Florida. Those charges were later dropped, after an appeals court determined that undercover video had been obtained illegally and could not be used at trial, though multiple spa workers faced penalties. Three women, including an owner and a manager, pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges, drawing thousands of dollars in fines, probation and community service. A fourth employee served 60 days in jail.

A spokeswoman for the New England Patriots said Kraft was not available for comment. Neither the Jupiter Police Department nor the Martin County Sheriff’s Office responded to requests for comment. A spokesman for Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, who dropped the charges against the men, declined to comment.

“After all of those headlines about all of those men who were in positions of power, what ends up happening at the end of the day? The only people charged were the women,” said Farrell of Northeastern University.

As Atlanta mourns the eight shooting victims, city officials have tried to avoid getting swept into the regulation debate. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who initially told reporters she wasn’t aware of any illegal activity at the spas, later clarified through a spokesman that she had learned about the prostitution stings only after her remarks.

Michael Smith, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a statement that “to the best of our knowledge, there have been no substantiated reasons during this administration to revoke business licenses at these properties.”

Still, some community members fear recent events could trigger a new wave of crackdowns that ignore the lessons from law enforcement’s problematic past.

“I don’t think law enforcement can be the ones to keep Asian migrants and massage workers safe,” said Yves Nguyen, an organizer with Red Canary Song, a group of migrant sex workers and advocates pushing for the decriminalization of the sex industry. “We want people to understand and respect sex workers. What do they want? They want to be safe. They don’t want to be policed.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Opinion | Inside the stimulus measure, the ACA gets an upgrade","I recently got a letter from Kathryn, a Spring Grove, Ill., mother who is doing her best to keep her family of three afloat. She and her family have gone without health insurance in recent years because they could not afford the premiums, yet make too much to qualify for the Affordable Care Act tax credit that reduces out-of-pocket premium prices. Her husband’s addiction treatment calls for inpatient rehab — a necessity they cannot afford even with insurance.

I tell you about Kathryn not because her story is unique but because it is far too common. There are millions of Americans such as Kathryn, agonizing over bills, trying to make do without health insurance, wondering if they will ever get ahead.

I learned early on in my career as a registered nurse that health care is make or break for many families. And as part of the Department of Health and Human Services team charged with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, I also learned that the ACA needed both improvements and protections. That became my reason for running for office when my predecessor was unwilling to protect me, a constituent with a preexisting condition, from getting my health care ripped away.

But the road to building on the ACA was long: President Barack Obama called for enhancements to the legislation even before he signed it into law. Republicans spent a decade sabotaging the law and trying to repeal it. Last year, House Democrats passed a measure to make plans more affordable, and it died in Mitch McConnell’s graveyard. Finally, this year, Democrats made an essential improvement that makes care more affordable to Americans of all incomes.

AD

Tucked inside the stimulus bill, the Health Care Affordability Act lowers out-of-pocket insurance costs in a variety of ways. The Biden administration estimates that 4 out of 5 enrollees will be able to find a plan for $10 or less per month per person. People with the lowest incomes and those who receive unemployment compensation this year may not have to pay a monthly premium at all. The law also caps premiums for plans purchased through the health insurance marketplace at 8.5 percent of household income, meaning families such as Kathryn’s will no longer have to choose between taking a job and losing affordable coverage.

Those whose earnings are above 400 percent of the federal poverty level, about $106,000 for a family of four, will now be eligible to receive tax credits to purchase affordable health-care coverage. A family of four making $90,000 will see premiums decrease by $200 per month, and an individual making $19,000 will not have to pay a monthly premium.

These are real, significant savings that will help families pay their rents or their mortgages or perhaps put a little away so a child can go to college — investments that will make our communities stronger.

AD

If you are uninsured or paying too much for your insurance, a special enrollment period is underway until Aug. 15. HealthCare.gov began displaying the new, lower prices on Thursday. Anyone currently enrolled in a plan who would like to access the lower premiums right away should visit HealthCare.gov to update their plan. Otherwise, they will recoup those savings when they file their taxes next year.

We didn’t get here without a fight. Republicans have been trying to kill the ACA since its infancy, and would again be at it today if they had control of the Congress. But like all laws, it was not perfect when it was written. With the American Rescue Plan, health care is not only here to stay, but it is higher quality, lower cost, and ready to protect you — during this pandemic and beyond.

Opinion | Should Facebook ban political ads? We have no idea.,"Former president Donald Trump’s penchant for baldfaced lies, including slanders of his opponent, provoked demands that Facebook and its peers refuse to accept payment for promoting them. The ultimate outcome was bans on all political advertising by Twitter, Pinterest and several other sites, as well as by Facebook and Google after the general election and ahead of the Georgia runoff. But whether these measures actually resolved the problem of rampant misinformation remains uncertain. So is whether they introduced different problems of their own, from the suppression of speech to an unequal effect on upstart campaigns with few followers to the inability to spread good information.

Without answers to those questions, platforms will be flying blind into future blackouts ahead of critical contests. Yet, those answers are hard to come by even today. The Federal Election Commission’s rules for political advertising just don’t order enough transparency to fit modern methods. The FEC requirements for labeling transactions, for instance, are too lax; an ad purchased on Facebook could be logged as “digital ads” or merely “ads.” More alarmingly, as much as 94 percent of ad spending may go through consultancies, but campaigns and PACs don’t have to report how those firms spend money on their behalf.

AD

AD

The loophole may enable the laundering of illegal spending, but it also means it’s impossible to tell how campaigns adjusted ad buys in response to ad bans. “We can see money going in,” say the Duke authors, “but we can’t see money going out.” Without knowing who shifted what amount of spending where, there’s no way of understanding whether bans affected incumbents more than challengers, or Democrats more than Republicans, or deep-pocketed campaigns more than their scrappier counterparts. There’s also no way of knowing how much speech was actually suppressed, or how much was redirected to forums with more robust fact-checking rules. Mandated and standardized ad archives would help, too, especially if they included the firms that coordinate ads across thousands of websites but don’t host them themselves.

These changes will likely require a mix of revisions by the FEC and legislation, including tweaked versions of bills already pending in Congress. These modest improvements to policy could have a profound impact on elections to come, at the least producing meaningful interventions against misinformation next time rather than only sound and fury.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion | No one has heard of the year’s ‘best’ movies. But there’s a surprising upside.,"According to a survey of 1,500 “active entertainment consumers” by Guts + Data, only 46 percent of those polled had heard of — not “seen and enjoyed,” not even “seen,” just “heard of” — “Judas and the Black Messiah.” And that Warner Bros. picture is the nominee with the highest awareness among its competitors. The least-heard-of movie is “Mank,” David Fincher’s dyspeptic look at Hollywood and the making of “Citizen Kane.” Only 18 percent of respondents knew that picture exists at all.

The lack of awareness stems in part from the fact that the film world was so disrupted this past year that it was hard to keep track of what was coming out, and when, and where, so many movie-watchers simply gave up. Given that this Oscars eligibility period produced a fair number of good films but no great films, and none that provoked widespread discussion, it’s hard to be surprised by these findings.

AD

AD

Consider also that the expansion of the slate of best-picture competitors has not had the desired effect of increasing the chances of popular movies winning the statue. After 2008, when Christopher Nolan’s second Batman movie, “The Dark Knight,” was snubbed for a best-picture nomination, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expanded the field from five nominees to 10, tweaking it again slightly a couple of years later to allow for up to 10. The result was a winner in 2010 with one of the lowest box-office totals in Oscar history. As good as “The Hurt Locker” is — and I think it’s quite good — its $17 million domestic gross is no one’s definition of a huge hit.

“The King’s Speech” and “Argo” are the only best-picture winners since the change to gross more than $100 million. (By way of comparison, seven of the nine best-picture winners in the 2000s preceding “The Hurt Locker” crossed that mark.) And while it would be foolish to suggest that a movie’s artistic merit is intrinsically tied to its box-office take, this is somewhat beside the point. Increasing the number of best-picture nominees has only accelerated the trend of little-watched films becoming awards-season darlings, turning off mainstream audiences.

The stats from Guts + Data suggest that nominating relatively obscure films does not do much to turn them into runaway hits. This was one of the loudest harrumphs when my colleague Alyssa Rosenberg suggested it might be a good idea to cancel the Oscars this year: “But what about the exposure these great, smaller movies will miss out on?” And yet, despite the fact that “Nomadland” is available to anyone who has an Internet connection, only 35 percent of active entertainment consumers have even heard of it, let alone seen it.

AD

AD

The siloed nature of streaming is an interesting variable here. Netflix’s penetration is approaching two-thirds of American homes, meaning “Mank” and “The Trial of the Chicago 7” weren’t just available to millions of home viewers, but featured on their Netflix home screens when they logged on for a binge. Why is the awareness of “Trial” (39 percent) more than twice that for “Mank”? Why is neither recognized by even half of those polled?

As I said, there was a glimmer of good news for the industry, and it’s this: “Judas and the Black Messiah” is the most-recognized movie. And I would suggest it’s the most-recognized movie not because it was on HBO Max, where sign-ups still lag, but because it’s playing simultaneously in theaters. Which means it got a big advertising push. Which meant people saw it on billboards and saw ads for it on TV.

Which meant people knew it existed.

AD

If movies want to retain their dominant position in the culture — a position under assault by prestige TV and ceding ground to YouTube and video games — the theatrical experience is the only way to do that. It’s the only way to assure awareness of pictures. It’s the only way to capture attention, to make a movie an event. No one will subscribe to every streaming service, but many people live within driving distance of a theater.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to see “Godzilla vs. Kong” on the biggest screen I can find. Watching a lizard punch a monkey is a special event. We should treat it that way.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
The shameless revisionism of the Capitol attack cannot be allowed to take root,"Come Tuesday, it will be three months since supporters of Donald Trump staged a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Not much time at all, really. But the former president and his enablers have been hard at work trying to persuade Americans not to believe what we all saw with our own eyes that day.

“It was zero threat,” Trump told friendly Fox News host Laura Ingraham last month. “Some of them went in, and they’re hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know? They had great relationships.”

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told a radio host that the rioters were “people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law,” and added: “I never felt threatened.”

This kind of shameless revisionism cannot be allowed to take root. It is important to keep fresh in our memories the true sights and sounds of that day — a day when Congress was supposed to be performing its duty to certify the electoral college tally of the 2020 election. A day when democracy itself came under attack by faux patriots.

The whole country witnessed an insurrectionist mob, which Trump later referred to as “very special” people, breaching the building and going on a rampage. More than 350 individuals have since been charged in violence that left five people dead and about 140 police officers injured.

Those who were there that day are haunted by memories of the sound of breaking glass. The horror of hearing shots fired in the House chamber, which was supposed to be one of the safest spots in Washington. The burn of tear gas. Fears for colleagues who couldn’t be accounted for.

Then there was the terror of a mother, working remotely, who had dropped off her two children that morning at the House day-care center, thinking it would be just an ordinary day.

“I sat there in agony, waiting for the next alert” from a Capitol complex under lockdown, she recalled, her voice breaking. ""I personally was not there, but the two people who matter to me most in the world were close enough.” She has since moved her children to a different day-care facility, because the sight of security fences and armed guards kept reminding her of what she could have lost that day.

Hers is one of the recollections that are being collected in an oral history project underway by Co-Equal, a nonprofit initiative led by former congressional staffers dedicated to making the legislative branch function more effectively. Participants are granted anonymity — understandably, given a very valid concern that they could become a target, again, if their identities are known.

But as I listened to their harrowing accounts, I was just as struck by the idealism and dedication of the thousands who go to work each day on Capitol Hill.

After the riot was contained, “there was a huge part of me that said I want to get back over there. I want to finish this joint session and I truly want the message to be that you didn’t win, that we did what we were supposed to do, that we completed the task that we had to do,” said one aide who had been evacuated from the House chamber.

“As a staffer, I have a very small part in how this thing plays out,” he said. “But I had a certain pride in wanting to make sure that we finished the counting of the electoral ballots and that truth would prevail.”

This is not the only effort underway to compile an eyewitness record of the day. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has instructed the House historian’s office to collect video interviews of individual lawmakers who were there.

But much more is needed. Efforts to put together an independent 9/11-style commission to examine what happened and why have been stalled in part because of Republican insistence on expanding its mission to antifa and other issues unrelated to Jan. 6.

Lawmakers themselves have been frustrated in their efforts to make public even basic information. Despite strengthened security measures, the Capitol’s continuing vulnerability was evident Friday, when a knife-wielding man killed a Capitol Police officer and wounded another after crashing his vehicle into an entry barricade.

Reps. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) and Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), the chairman and ranking minority-party member, respectively, of a subcommittee that oversees the Capitol Police, recently wrote a letter calling for the release of an upcoming report by the Capitol Police’s inspector general that would examine how the legislative branch’s law enforcement agency performed three months ago.

“In the wake of the January 6th attack that shook the confidence of so many Americans, taking a more open and transparent approach isn’t just the right thing to do, it will be the most effective as we seek to restore citizens’ confidence that the heart of America’s government is secure,” the two lawmakers wrote.

The truth is the least of what we owe the public servants whose lives were on the line that day. And just as important, it is what we owe ourselves.

"Opinion | Democrats, don’t pass the SALT (cap repeal)","The tedious fact is that there are only two ways to finance a government: present taxes and future taxes (counting the stealthy tax of inflation). Debt is taxation deferred.

Near Pittsburgh on Wednesday, President Biden promised to shred a campaign promise — not to raise taxes on those with annual income below $400,000 — that was contradicted by his campaign promise to increase corporate taxation. And Biden might be unable to increase taxes on corporations without simultaneously cutting taxes on many wealthy individuals.

Infrastructure — very broadly defined — is Washington’s subject du jour. As currently bandied, the noun denotes much more than what normal speakers of the English language mean by infrastructure — roads, bridges, etc. Abnormal English speakers, of whom there always are many in government, use semantic slipperiness to impart momentum to their preferences. Hence the Biden administration’s fondness for the phrase “human infrastructure.” This denotes anything that might conceivably do what concrete-and-steel infrastructure does — improve productivity. “Human infrastructure” includes day care, pre-K education, free community college, paid family and medical leave, combating climate change, augmenting “equity” and anything else that could conceivably have positive knock-on effects.

Biden’s capacious infrastructure idea is expensive. The crux of his plan to pay for a fraction of it is to increase the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. Before Congress in 2017 cut the rate from 35 percent, it was the developed world’s highest. Former president Barack Obama favored cutting it.

People can reasonably disagree about the proper amount of corporate taxation. Wise people favor a corporate tax rate of zero because corporations do not pay taxes. They collect them, and distribute the burdens between employees (less money for compensation), shareholders (lower dividends and capital gains, which are, effectively, subject to corporate taxation) and customers (higher prices). The Cato Institute’s Scott Lincicome cites a 2020 study showing that the corporate tax’s “incidence on consumers, workers, and shareholders is 31 percent, 38 percent, and 31 percent, respectively.” Few of those who actually will pay Biden’s corporate tax increase have annual incomes of $400,000.

AD

AD

Writing in City Journal, economic historian John Steele Gordon says William Howard Taft assumed that the 1913 ratification of the 16th Amendment (enabling taxation of individuals’ incomes) a month before his presidency ended would lead to the abolition of the corporate tax. Silly him. A Democratic Congress aligned with Taft’s successor, the progressive Woodrow Wilson, raised the corporate tax.

Gordon argues that abolition of corporate taxation would eliminate much of the approximately 3.9-million-word tax code. This would, however, dismay the political class, which practices crony capitalism by conferring indirect subsidies on corporations in the form of tax abatements. Today, Gordon writes, corporate managers focus on after-tax profits, which is a stock market fixation, and “an artifact of lobbying success in Washington.” With no corporate taxation, profits would rise, as would dividends, which are taxed. And foreign companies would rush to invest here.

Instead, to get enough House Democrats to support the foolishness of increased corporate taxation, the Biden administration might have to endorse repealing something intelligent from 2017. Republicans then imposed a $10,000 cap on deductions of state and local taxes (SALT) by individuals filing their federal income taxes. An uncapped SALT deduction would almost entirely benefit very wealthy taxpayers in high-tax states and cities, and subsidize the growth of state and local governments by somewhat reducing resistance to their taxes.

AD

Assume unanimous House Republican opposition to increased corporate taxation. Democrats have only an eight-seat House majority. Already four Democrats have made their support for the infrastructure taxation package conditional on repeal of the SALT cap. There probably will be others. Preaching progressivism — deploring the cupidity of rich, denouncing tax cuts for them — is more exhilarating than practicing it.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Opinion | Insider trading indictment highlights contacts with Bloomberg reporter,"The indictment alleges that 38-year-old Jason Peltz of Brooklyn, N.Y., leveraged so-called “material nonpublic information” to make securities transactions in brokerage accounts of co-conspirators. “While most Americans dream of winning the lottery or finding a stock before it takes off, Peltz rigged the system for his personal gain, creating fortune for himself at the expense of others,” said Jonathan D. Larsen, special agent-in-charge with the IRS criminal investigation unit, in a DOJ release.

AD

AD

According to the indictment, Peltz previously worked at a financial services firm and also co-founded a mobile app start-up. Whatever his background, Peltz allegedly managed to ingratiate himself with Hammond, who started at Bloomberg in 2015. A central allegation in the document is that Peltz obtained a tip in February 2016 “via” an unnamed insider at Ferro Corporation, an Ohio-based producer of coatings for metal, glass and ceramics, among other items. A takeover offer from an investment firm was in the works, the tip indicated.

Before the public announcement of the takeover bid, Peltz traded in Ferro using the brokerage accounts of alleged co-conspirators. Then, the government says, he tipped off Hammond to the news. On March 15, 2016, Hammond and a colleague published a story at Bloomberg under the headline, “Ferro Said to Have Received Takeover Approach From Apollo.” It attributed the news to “people with knowledge of the matter.” The story raised Ferro’s stock price, according to the indictment — and Peltz and his co-conspirators made money from the boost.

According to the indictment, Hammond and Peltz had frequent conversations after that story. There’s little detail in the indictment about these conversations. (In fact, the document doesn’t even name Bloomberg or Hammond. It is explicit about the date, time and content of the stories in question, however, and Hammond is the only journalist to carry bylines in all of the stories.) The indictment claims that Peltz secured information about “forthcoming articles regarding certain companies.” The document goes on to detail how accounts used by Peltz made moves on securities in four companies — Medivation, INC Research Holdings, R.R. Donnelley and Community Health Systems — before the publication of news-breaking Bloomberg stories about them.

To repeat: Hammond isn’t under indictment and hasn’t been accused of misconduct. In a statement sent to the Erik Wemple Blog, a Bloomberg spokesperson noted, “Ed Hammond is a very accomplished reporter. We’re not aware of any facts to suggest any wrongdoing on his part.” Contacted by phone, Hammond referred this blog to Bloomberg’s PR department. He works in a newsroom with a history of “paying some of its reporters explicitly for publishing ‘market-moving’ stories.” Asked if that policy remains in place, Bloomberg News sent this reply: “We compensate journalists based on their performance, which includes multiple factors.”

Reporters are essentially insiders in whatever industry they cover. Whether their beat is politics, crime, media, entertainment, sports, business — you name it — they share their insights, gossip and punditry with sources all the time. They need to test hunches, tips and assumptions, and other insiders provide an ideal sounding board.

Journalists in Hammond’s hypercompetitive niche, however, traffic in information that can make people really rich, really fast. A former reporter on the mergers-and-acquisitions beat says, “You’d have to be very careful who you talked to,” noting that there were traders who were “not beyond calling reporters and trying to obtain information from them aside from what’s printed in the press, and you really can’t be naïve about who can potentially misuse information.”

AD

AD

John C. Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, summarizes the bind in which reporters like Hammond find themselves when they’re approached by a well-informed source: “He’s probably got a personal motive, but you want to get news to the public.”

Bloomberg is famous for the strictures it places on reporters and editors on sourcing and other ethically fraught areas. “The Bloomberg Way,” the publication’s “Guide for Reporters and Editors,” addresses reporter-source management this way: “Sometimes we may have to disclose nonpublic and potentially market-moving information to a person from whom we seek comments or verification. Be prudent in sharing, and avoid being specific on the timing of publication.”

There are good reasons for prudence: In 1985, R. Foster Winans, who wrote the Wall Street Journal’s “Heard on the Street” column, was found guilty of securities fraud for sharing details of upcoming columns with traders. He used the proceeds from the scam to supplement his meager $28,000 annual salary. The Peltz indictment, by contrast, carries no indication that Hammond derived such benefits from his interactions with Peltz. Of course, says Coffee, “the criminal indictment does mention the reporter in ways that could embarrass him.”",2021-04-01 00:00:00
"Your questions about coronavirus vaccines, answered","chevron-right Can I return to my old activities?

The CDC advises fully vaccinated people that they can gather indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or social distancing. The agency also says fully vaccinated people can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from a single household without wearing masks or social distancing — if the unvaccinated are healthy and at low risk of contracting severe covid-19 disease. That would free older people to see nearby children and grandchildren. Long-distance travel is also low-risk and fully vaccinated people do not need to quarantine or get tested, but government health officials have said it is still not recommended.

Visits to unvaccinated people at higher risk, such as older people or those with underlying health conditions, still should be conducted outdoors, or in a well-ventilated space, and with masks on, the CDC says.

The CDC considers fully vaccinated to mean two weeks after a final shot of vaccine.

Fully vaccinated people also do not need to quarantine or be tested if they are exposed to the virus as long as they do not develop symptoms. Fully vaccinated employees of high-density workplaces such as meatpacking plants without symptoms also do not need to quarantine after an exposure. But a test is recommended to be certain.

Public health experts say in the short term, life will look much the same after you get vaccinated, until a larger share of the population is vaccinated and the pandemic is curbed. For the most part, they recommend that people still wear masks and maintain their distance around most people.

One reason for caution is that the vaccines in use are robustly — but not completely — effective at preventing covid-19 from the original strain of the coronavirus they were tested against. They also may confer less protection against newer variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil that are now circulating in the United States. So there is a small possibility that people who are vaccinated could get sick, though it is very unlikely they would be hospitalized or die.

Scientists haven’t ruled out the possibility that people who have been inoculated can transmit the virus to the unvaccinated. They are hoping to have data on that issue in the next few months and, if it shows that vaccinated people cannot be carriers, that could lead to more relaxed interactions.",2020-11-17 00:00:00
What you need to know about the coronavirus variants,"What you need to know about the coronavirus variants

Viruses are always mutating and taking on new forms. The coronavirus has thousands of variants that have been identified. But several, including variants first found in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, are highly transmissible and have sparked concerns that vaccines may be less effective against them.

The same protective measures that have warded off the virus throughout the pandemic — maintaining social distance, wearing masks and washing our hands — are even more critical in the face of more transmissible variants.

The New York variant (B.1.526)

Where and when was it discovered?

This variant, which was found in samples obtained as early as November, probably emerged in the Washington Heights section of New York, Fauci told reporters in March. By the middle of that month, this variant made up nearly half of the city’s new infections.

Where is it now?

Officials have reported this variant in at least 14 other states, including Texas, Wyoming and Maryland, Bloomberg reported.

What makes it different?

Some scientists are concerned that this variant may be more transmissible than previous versions. Scott Gottlieb, former director of the Food and Drug Administration, expressed worry that a mutation on this variant could enable it to reinfect people who have already had the virus.

Will vaccines work?

This variant seems to have some resistance to existing vaccines, although not as much as the variant first detected in South Africa, Fauci said on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” Gottlieb said he was also concerned that this variant could partly elude the effects of vaccination.

The South Africa variant (B.1.351)

Where and when was it discovered?

This mutation, also referred to as 501Y.V2, was found in South Africa in early October and announced in December, when the country’s health minister said the strain seemed to affect young people more than previous strains. This variant may have contributed to a surge of infections and hospitalizations across South Africa.

Where is it?

This mutation has been identified in at least four dozen countries. On Jan. 28, South Carolina officials announced that this variant had affected two people there with no travel history — the first instances of this strain identified in the United States. It has since been found in more than two dozen other states.

What makes it different?

This mutation shares some similarities to the variant first identified in the U.K. and, like that strain, appears to be more transmissible. There is no evidence that it is more lethal. Gottlieb has suggested that this variant might be more resistant to antibody therapies.

There is some evidence that this variant could allow for reinfection: A man in France was in critical condition in mid-February after being infected with this strain four months after he was previously infected with the virus.

Will vaccines work?

The vaccines may have a diminished impact against this variant, but they probably will still be effective, top infectious-diseases expert Anthony S. Fauci said in January. Moderna has said its vaccine protects against the variant first identified in South Africa, with an important caveat: The vaccine-elicited antibodies were also less effective at neutralizing this mutation in a laboratory dish.

Pfizer and BioNTech released their own study, not yet peer-reviewed, that suggests their vaccine effectively neutralizes this variant, though was slightly less effective.

On Jan. 29, Johnson & Johnson said its single-shot vaccine was robustly effective in a massive global trial, but that its protection against sickness was weaker in South Africa. Biotechnology company Novavax has also indicated that its vaccine was significantly less effective during a trial in South Africa.

In South Africa, the distribution of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been halted. The vaccine did not provide sufficient protection against mild and moderate cases caused by a new variant, health officials said.

U.K. variant (B.1.1.7)

Where and when was it discovered?

This variant was first found in the United Kingdom, specifically in London and the nearby county of Kent, in September. It is sometimes referred to as the “Kent” variant. It has been spreading rapidly in Britain, Denmark and Ireland since December.

Where is it?

Dozens of countries, including the United States, have seen infections from this variant of the virus. It is by far the most prevalent variant of concern in the United States, with thousands of cases across the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a model forecast in early January that indicated the variant could become the dominant strain in the United States by some point in March. A recent study showed this variant was spreading rapidly in the United States by early February.

What makes it different?

The variant first identified in the U.K. appears more transmissible than the more common strain. Preliminary data also suggests that this strain may be 30 to 70 percent more lethal than previous mutations.

Will vaccines work?

The scientific consensus is that the vaccines will remain effective against this mutation because those inoculations provoke an array of neutralizing antibodies and other immune-system responses. Biotechnology companies Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have said their vaccines appear to work against this variant.

Ravindra Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, found in a study of older adults that the immune response triggered by the Pfizer vaccine was modestly less effective against the variant first identified in the U.K.

The ‘Eeek’ mutation (E484K)

Where and when was it discovered?

This might best be described as a mutation within a mutation. It’s called E484K — or “Eeek,” as epidemiologists refer to it — and it’s appearing on some of the variants we describe below. It’s not brand new; it has appeared many times since the start of the pandemic, but experts have been concerned about it. It gained mainstream attention when it started to coincide with other variants that are more contagious.

Where is it?

Eeek has been seen in the variants first discovered in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. It has also been detected in more than 200 samples of the virus sequenced in the United States since May.

What makes it different?

The Eeek mutation changes the virus’s spike protein, which is what vaccines target. By itself, this mutation does not change the virus significantly. The concern with this mutation is when it’s paired with the other variants, which could help the virus evade detection and make neutralization by the human immune system less efficient.

Will vaccines work?

Scientists are actively trying to answer this question. Clinical trial data have indicated that vaccines were less effective in preventing infections with variants in South Africa featuring the mutation. But the vaccines still dramatically lowered the chance of severe illness or death.

Semi-related to the vaccine question: One study found preliminary evidence that patients in South Africa who had survived an earlier bout with the more common coronavirus were becoming infected a second time — though not severely ill — after exposure to the variant with this mutation.

Brazil variant (P. 1)

Where and when was it discovered?

Sequencing studies found the variant in Brazil, mainly in Rio de Janeiro, as early as July. Researchers in Japan discovered it in travelers from Brazil in January.

Where is it now?

It has been confirmed in more than two dozen countries, including Japan, Spain and New Zealand. On Jan. 25, Minnesota health officials confirmed the first U.S. case of this variant in a resident with recent travel history to Brazil. It has since been found in at least 18 states.

What makes it different?

The variant has more than a dozen alterations, several of which are found on the virus’s spike protein, which binds the virus to a cell. Because of that, researchers think the strain is probably more transmissible. There is also some early evidence that antibodies might not recognize the P.1 variant, which could lead to reinfection.

Will vaccines work?

There’s no strong evidence right now suggesting that vaccines won’t work against the variant first identified in Brazil. However, scientists have raised the possibility that this variant can evade antibodies, which would impact the current vaccines’ effectiveness.

A study of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine published in March determined that it was highly effective at neutralizing the variant found in Brazil. Moderna has announced that it would develop a new vaccine tailored to a similar variant in case an updated shot becomes necessary.

The Denmark/California mutation (L452R)

Where and when was it discovered?

This mutation was detected in Denmark in March.

Where is it now?

A variant with this mutation was found in California this winter and became dominant there over five months, eventually making up more than half of infections in 44 of the state’s 58 counties. This mutation has also been confirmed in several other states.

What makes it different?

There is evidence that this mutation enhances the virus’s ability to bind to human receptor cells, making it more transmissible. Some scientists are urging public-health officials to declare the variant with this mutation circulating in California a “variant of concern,” which would make it the first homegrown variant with this label.

Will vaccines work?

Some scientists think this mutation might make the virus more resistant to vaccines because the mutation is in the spike protein, which enables the virus to attach to cells. But scientists also say that more study is needed before they can draw conclusions.

New research shows California coronavirus variant is more transmissible

Another coronavirus variant linked to growing share of cases, several large outbreaks, in California

The original variant (D614G)

Where and when was it discovered?

This mutation, known to scientists simply as “G,” was discovered in China in January 2020. It soon spread through New York City and Europe.

Where is it?

The “G” mutation has become ubiquitous. By July, about 70 percent of the 50,000 genomes of the coronavirus uploaded by researchers worldwide to a shared database carried the variant.

What makes it different?

Some scientists think this mutation is significantly more transmissible than the original strain of the virus. That’s because this variant has four to five times more spikes on its surface. Those spikes enable the virus to latch onto and infect cells. But other scientists still contest the greater transmissibility.

Will vaccines work?

The G variant was the dominant strain when 2020 vaccine trials took place. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed a 95 percent efficacy in trials.

This coronavirus mutation has taken over the world. Scientists are trying to understand why.

British officials identify coronavirus mutations, but significance remains unclear

How can we protect ourselves from the variants?

The same protective measures that have warded off the virus throughout the pandemic — maintaining social distance, wearing masks and washing our hands — are even more critical in the face of more transmissible variants. Those guidelines will simultaneously keep you from becoming ill from one of those variants, while making it harder for the virus to mutate in the first place.

“Viruses don’t mutate unless they replicate,” Fauci said in January.

But it’s also important for scientists to learn as much as they can about these variants, in case there are specific ways we can slow their spread. Until the research exists, we can’t make assumptions about what new variants will do.

What do the variants mean for vaccines?

“We need to get as many people vaccinated with the current vaccine that we have as we possibly can … and prepare for the potential eventuality that we might have to update this vaccine sometime in the future.” — Fauci in January

As more significant variants are reported, the obvious (and arguably most important) question is whether the vaccines will work on them. Some of the mutations have sparked particular concern because they affect the spikes on the virus, which is what the vaccines target.

In short, the pharmaceutical companies are testing new variants against their vaccines and spinning up new trials. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech can update their vaccines quickly because of their mRNA technology, which can be reprogrammed to target new variants.

Pfizer and Moderna have run tests on the variants and while the vaccines still triggered a response, they appeared to be less effective.

A growing number of scientists anticipate that we will eventually need something similar to the annual flu shot — companies will periodically update their vaccines to match the prevalent coronavirus variants, and we will need to get boosters to stay protected.

“With flu, we need to adapt the vaccines. We can see that already,” said Ravindra Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge. “The companies do realize there is a problem in the longer term, and they will deal with it just as we have done with flu every year.”

"What to know about the coronavirus vaccine rollout in D.C., Maryland and Virginia","How many doses have been given out so far?

Is there enough vaccine for everyone who is now eligible to get one?

No. Every state gets a new allotment of doses each week, and they have far fewer doses available than the number of people who qualify for them.

AD

AD

The health departments make more appointments available every week as they get more doses from the federal government.

Which medical conditions will qualify residents for early coronavirus vaccines?

In Virginia, people with medical conditions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say are proven to increase the severity of coronavirus infections, including cancer, chronic kidney disease and certain heart conditions, are currently eligible for vaccinations. The Virginia Department of Health says many of those individuals will be offered the vaccine through their health care providers.

In Maryland, hospital patients who are receiving cancer treatment or hemodialysis, who have undergone a solid organ transplant or who suffer from COPD or Type 1 or 2 diabetes are all currently eligible for a vaccine. Those with illnesses who are not current hospital patients will become eligible later.

AD

AD

The District also is offering vaccinations to people 16 or older with serious health problems. Residents who have conditions such as cancer, diabetes or kidney or liver disease, or who have a body mass index of 30 or higher can seek a vaccine through their doctor or the city’s public registration system.

Do I have to get vaccinated in my state, or can I go to another state?

Across the region, some essential workers like health-care workers and teachers can get vaccinated in the state in which they work.

Within states, residents have been confused about whether they can get vaccinated in a county where they don’t live. Prince George’s County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) announced Jan. 25 that her county’s health officials are canceling appointments scheduled by Marylanders who don’t live or work in the county, but mass vaccination sites including Six Flags in Prince George’s remain open to all Marylanders.

How can I make an appointment or register to get a vaccine?

D.C. residents who are eligible can sign up for a vaccination appointment here. In addition to the city’s registration system, which allows eligible residents and workers to sign up for shots at retail pharmacies and other locations, the website also offers information about the many D.C. hospital systems that have their own registration systems for vaccinations. Eligible patients might want to try multiple registration systems. Children’s National opened a waitlist for 16- and 17-year-olds with medical conditions who qualify for the vaccine. Only 200 spots will be available on the waitlist at a time; Diana Troese, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said new spots may open daily.

AD

AD

On Wednesday, March 10, the city’s revamped portal for vaccine appointments launched. It asks eligible residents to register once and then await an email with a link they can use to make an appointment. Once registrants are chosen to get a vaccine, they will be notified through a call, a text or an email and will need to book their appointment within 48 hours — or wait until they are selected again. Going forward, invitations will be sent out at 10 a.m. Thursdays and Sundays. Eligible individuals may also register over the phone. Forty percent of the initial portal appointments will be reserved for residents 65 and older, while another 40 percent will go to residents ages 18 to 64 with a qualifying medical condition. Twenty percent of appointments will go to essential workers. Half of all these appointments are reserved for people who live in priority Zip codes.

Maryland residents who are eligible to get vaccinated can find a vaccination clinic here. Maryland residents may also need to contact multiple clinics from this map to find an appointment. The state launched a centralized preregistration system for people to sign up for appointments at the state’s mass vaccination sites.

Virginia created a statewide registration system for residents to register for vaccine appointments. Residents can also call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA to register. However, since Fairfax County has opted out of the state system, residents of that county must continue to register for appointments here.

What about mass vaccination sites?

Maryland plans to open six, with four already launched and a fifth set to open March 25. All operate on an appointment-only basis for Maryland residents, but currently spots are extremely limited. The Six Flags site in Prince George’s County accepts appointments for anyone who is eligible under state rules, regardless of where they live. The Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital screens eligible residents and offers appointments based on age, illness and other factors. Appointments began at a third site — M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore — on Thursday, Feb. 25, and began at a fourth site — the Regency Furniture Stadium in Charles County — on March 4. Another site will be added in Hagerstown on March 25. More sites will be added in March if the state has received enough vaccine from the federal government.

I’m a senior citizen. How do I get a vaccine?

In the District, senior citizens can sign up for appointments at vaccinate.dc.gov or can call 855-363-0333 to register by phone.

AD

Some senior citizens in the District can also make a vaccine appointment through a hospital system or a health clinic, including Kaiser Permanente, Howard University, Sibley and George Washington University health systems and nonprofits including Mary’s Center, Community of Hope, Bread for the City and more. Some appointments are open only to existing patients of those clinics, and some hospital appointments are open to all. The District provides links to all of the health-care providers giving shots here.

In Maryland, residents over 65 can find a vaccination clinic here. Montgomery County, which had been holding off vaccinating people ages 65 to 74 at its county-run clinics, began sending out vaccine registration links to certain essential workers and people 65 and older on March 3. Prince George’s County said county-run vaccination clinics expanded eligibility as of March 15 to people ages 65-74 and some additional categories of essential workers.

In Virginia, residents can use the state’s registration system to register for vaccine appointments, or call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA. However, since Fairfax County has opted out of the system, residents of that county must continue to register for appointments here. And those seeking to get vaccinated through CVS must still register through that pharmacy’s website, which is not connected with the statewide system.

I’m a health-care worker or front-line essential worker. How do I get a vaccine?

You may be able to get vaccinated at your workplace. If not, follow the same steps described above for senior citizens if you work in the District or Virginia. If you work in Maryland, you should receive information about registering for a vaccine through your workplace.

I’m not eligible yet. How can I find out when it’s my turn to get a vaccine?

In Maryland, residents who are signed up for the state’s emergency text alerts will get a text message each time the state starts vaccinating a new group. To sign up, send a text message to 898211 with the phrase “MdReady.”

Virginia residents can check their health departments’ websites for more information on vaccine stages. (Click here for Virginia.)

D.C. plans to make the remaining essential workers eligible in stages. On March 29, journalists who must work in person currently and ride-share drivers become eligible. Construction workers, higher education workers who must work in person, and other remaining essential workers become eligible on April 12.

The District then plans to open vaccine eligibility to all residents age 16 and up on May 1, as President Biden has called for. This does not mean that there will be enough doses available to give every adult a shot that day, but any adult can seek a vaccine at that point.

Which groups will get vaccinated next?

The District and Virginia will next offer coronavirus vaccinations to additional groups of essential workers. Maryland will next offer doses to all residents aged 60 and older beginning Tuesday, March 23. After that, residents over 16 with certain health conditions will be eligible. More essential workers and residents over 50 will be eligible starting April 13, followed by all remaining residents over 16 by April 27.

Will I be notified when it’s my turn to get a vaccine?

Not automatically. Maryland residents can sign up for notifications by texting the phrase “MdReady” to the number 898211. Marylanders also can preregister for the state’s mass vaccination sites here.

District residents can preregister for a vaccine appointment here. It will ask eligible residents to register once and then await an email with a link they can use to make an appointment.

Virginia’s statewide registration system will send out weekly reminders to residents that they are still in the queue. Fairfax County, which is opting out of the state’s registration system, launched its own data dashboard, which allows people who signed up with that county to get more information about when they might get appointments.

Can I volunteer to help out at a vaccination site?

Right now, the D.C. Medical Reserve Corps is taking both medical and nonmedical volunteers aged 18 and older on an as-needed basis. In Maryland, volunteers can sign up for the Maryland Responds Medical Reserve Corps. And Virginia has the Virginia Medical Reserve Corps. More volunteer opportunities may become available later as vaccinations continue to ramp up.

Are pharmacies giving doses to anyone if they have extra doses left at the end of the day?

A few lucky people have happened onto a shot this way, like law student David MacMillan, who recorded his experience in a TikTok video that went viral. McMillan and a friend were shopping at a Giant grocery store in Northeast Washington when a pharmacist offered to vaccinate them because she had an open vial of the vaccine that would otherwise be discarded and the store was closing soon.

AD

AD

Could the same thing happen to you? It’s extremely unlikely.

The D.C. health department does urge pharmacists to use doses on any available person rather than let them expire. However, hospitals and health centers have an on-call list of their own staff who are not front-line workers but who could get vaccinated if an extra dose needs to be used. Hanging out at your nearest pharmacy, or calling grocery stores, is not at all likely to get you a vaccination — and spending extra time in public places is a very bad idea if you’re not vaccinated.

Basically, if you’re not an essential worker or in another prioritized group, the best thing to do is stay home and wait.

Are coronavirus vaccinations free?

"Your questions about coronavirus vaccines, answered","chevron-right Can I return to my old activities?

The CDC advises fully vaccinated people that they can gather indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or social distancing. The agency also says fully vaccinated people can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from a single household without wearing masks or social distancing — if the unvaccinated are healthy and at low risk of contracting severe covid-19 disease. That would free older people to see nearby children and grandchildren. Long-distance travel is also low-risk and fully vaccinated people do not need to quarantine or get tested, but government health officials have said it is still not recommended.

Visits to unvaccinated people at higher risk, such as older people or those with underlying health conditions, still should be conducted outdoors, or in a well-ventilated space, and with masks on, the CDC says.

The CDC considers fully vaccinated to mean two weeks after a final shot of vaccine.

Fully vaccinated people also do not need to quarantine or be tested if they are exposed to the virus as long as they do not develop symptoms. Fully vaccinated employees of high-density workplaces such as meatpacking plants without symptoms also do not need to quarantine after an exposure. But a test is recommended to be certain.

Public health experts say in the short term, life will look much the same after you get vaccinated, until a larger share of the population is vaccinated and the pandemic is curbed. For the most part, they recommend that people still wear masks and maintain their distance around most people.

One reason for caution is that the vaccines in use are robustly — but not completely — effective at preventing covid-19 from the original strain of the coronavirus they were tested against. They also may confer less protection against newer variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil that are now circulating in the United States. So there is a small possibility that people who are vaccinated could get sick, though it is very unlikely they would be hospitalized or die.

Scientists haven’t ruled out the possibility that people who have been inoculated can transmit the virus to the unvaccinated. They are hoping to have data on that issue in the next few months and, if it shows that vaccinated people cannot be carriers, that could lead to more relaxed interactions.",
The covid-19 symptoms to watch out for,"Although this list is not inclusive of every possible symptom, it includes what physicians and health experts have determined are the most common. Some of these symptoms will coincide with one another. Symptoms of a coronavirus infection can emerge anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus.

Fever, cough or shortness of breath

Fever, cough or shortness of breath are the highest-frequency symptoms of covid-19. According to a study of symptoms in about 11,000 adult covid-19 patients, at least one of these symptoms was reported in 93 percent of cases.

AD

AD

Fever or chills

A fever might be the first indication you have a covid-19 infection, according to a recent study that looked at the onset of symptoms.

The fever itself can range from low-grade — maybe only a degree or two higher than normal — to dangerously high. A fever higher than 103 degrees Fahrenheit is considered very high in adults and is a sign of a severe infection.

You can experience chills in which your body feels cold for no apparent reason. It might be a cozy temperature, but you’re still shivering. Chills are most common with a fever, or when a fever is coming on, but they don’t always coincide with fever.

Cough

The coronavirus is a respiratory illness, so cough is a common symptom, and it can also appear early in the infection. A dry, persistent cough can be a red flag that you have covid-19.

AD

AD

Shortness of breath

Along with the cough can come shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Covid-19 can sometimes cause pneumonia, according to Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Johns Hopkins.

Pneumonia occurs when “air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, limiting their ability to take in oxygen and causing shortness of breath, cough and other symptoms,” Galiatsatos writes.

Shortness of breath caused by covid-19 can be mild or severe enough to require treatment with supplemental oxygen or a ventilator.

Fatigue or muscle aches

Sometimes the only indication that you might have of a viral infection is a general sickly feeling, or what physicians call fatigue — a persistent exhaustion that isn’t solved by getting more sleep.

AD

In extreme cases, people who have suffered from covid-19 describe having barely enough energy to walk to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for a glass of water.

AD

Some people report muscle aches or general achiness for no other apparent reason.

Fatigue and aches have also been reported by so-called covid-19 “long-haulers,” who continue to experience symptoms of the illness for weeks or months after becoming infected.

Headache

Headache is the most common neurological symptom in covid-19.

Other less-common neurological symptoms could include muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures and stroke, according to Harvard Medical School.

Loss or distorted sense of smell or taste

The loss of smell or taste is typically linked to early symptoms of upper-respiratory infections — including previous coronavirus strains — because the virus damages olfactory bulbs that are involved in the sense of smell.

AD

It appears to be more common for people who have covid-19, and it’s possible to lose your sense of smell or taste while experiencing no other symptoms.

AD

Another possible symptom is a distorted sense of smell or taste.

Richard Doty, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Smell and Taste Center, told The Washington Post that certain distortions, including one that causes everything to have a fecal-like odor, can make common food and drinks revolting, because flavor is tied to sense of smell. “Even water can become unpleasant,” he said.

The distortions are most common in people who are recovering from covid-19 and starting to get their smell back, according to Justin Turner, medical director of Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Smell and Taste Center.

Sore throat, congestion or runny nose

A sore throat, congestion or runny nose are less frequently associated with covid-19, but they still occur in enough cases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added them to its list.

AD

AD

A runny nose was reported by about 7 percent of adult patients in the study of symptom frequency, while a sore throat was reported by 35 percent.

It can be difficult to determine whether these symptoms are a result of covid-19 or something more benign, such as allergies.

But allergies, which are an overreaction of the immune system to foreign particles, would not trigger things such as a fever, muscle aches or chills, according to Sally Joo Bailey, an allergist at Allergy Associates of Northern Virginia in Arlington. Those are the classic signs of a viral infection, such as covid-19.

Stomach issues

Studies have found that about half of coronavirus patients experience at least one gastrointestinal symptom, which can include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort.

AD

AD

In the study of symptom frequency, diarrhea was the most common gastrointestinal-related symptom in adults, and abdominal pain was the least common.

Difference between covid-19 and the flu

The potential winter surge of coronavirus infections could coincide with another major public health event: the seasonal flu. Here's what you need to know. (The Washington Post)

A key difference is the transmissivity: The coronavirus spreads more easily than the flu. Public health officials have encouraged everyone to get vaccinated against the flu this year to help ward off a bad flu season superimposed on a pandemic — and having had a flu shot could also help rule it out if you start to experience any of these symptoms.

Ultimately, infectious-disease doctors say most people won’t be able to tell which illness they have. Common warning signs for both include fever, cough, chills and shortness of breath.

AD

The one symptom that’s common with covid-19, but not with the flu, is loss of taste and smell. But not everyone with covid-19 experiences that symptom, and experts warned that someone with allergies or a cold might also struggle to smell because they have a stuffy nose.

Absent a loss of taste or smell, most patients will need a nasal swab to get a proper diagnosis.",2020-12-02 00:00:00

New confirmed cases of the coronavirus remain high and near their January peak, as the world struggles with unequal vaccine rollout and new threats posed by a variety of fast spreading virus variants.

After more than a year of the pandemic, over 2.8 million people have died of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, since it first emerged in Wuhan, China, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Even countries with successful vaccine distribution plans are facing new surges. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters in March that she had the “recurring feeling [...] of impending doom.”

[A detailed look at the virus’s spread through U.S. counties and states]

The United States continues to lead the world in number of vaccine doses given out, though some other nations, including some far smaller, have vaccinated far more of their population. The vaccines were developed and rolled out at record speed, and studies show most have impressive efficiency.

Hundreds of millions of doses have been given out around the world, more than triple the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 since the start of the pandemic — though a large number of cases were likely never recorded, experts caution.

But the vaccine rollout has been persistently unequal, with problems with global supply and pockets of opposition in many nations. Covax, a program to distribute vaccines fairly backed by the World Health Organization, only belatedly began distributing doses to low-income nations.

“I can’t say it’s surprising,” said Thomas J. Bollyky, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “In every previous pandemic where we have our global health crisis, where there has been limited supplies of medical intervention, wealthy nations have hoarded.”

Even in some high-income nations, vaccination programs have been beleaguered with problems. As new, more transmissible variants took hold in these countries, they have been forced to return to lockdowns and other restrictions to try and re-take control.

“We will lose control if we do not move now,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in March as he announced a new four-week lockdown.

The United States, which continues to have the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths globally, set a record with more than 300,000 confirmed new daily cases in January. Over 550,000 deaths from covid-19 have been recorded across the country.

Though cases dipped after January, a new wave began only a few months later, prompting President Biden to urge governors to reinstate mask mandates and other virus-related restrictions. “This is deadly serious,” Biden said in March.

Behind the United States, countries including Brazil, India, France and Russia have the largest number of cases.

In Brazil, the rampant spread of the virus has led to more than one variant spreading among the population. The most widespread, known as P.1, was first first identified in the Amazon rainforest but was later found in more than two dozen countries, including the United States.

Some experts have raised concerns that the unmitigated spread in Brazil could lead to the spread of variants against which current vaccines would be less effective. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a skeptic throughout the pandemic, is facing a political crisis at the same time.

“If Brazil is not serious, then it will continue to affect all of the neighborhood there — and beyond,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said in March. “This is not just about Brazil. It’s about the whole Latin America, and even beyond.”

Variants have also caused huge levels of concern in Europe, where the vaccine rollout has suffered numerous setbacks. More than fifty countries across the region have reported concerns about a variant first identified in Britain and known as B.1.1.7, which is more transmissible and can increase the risk of hospitalization, according to the WHO.

""Let me be clear: We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now,” said Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said in a statement in March.

Despite a dramatic decline in cases at the start of the year, India saw a fresh surge this spring that many attributed to the spread of new variants. Though tens of millions of doses have been administered in the country, the virus may be spreading faster than the vaccine in the huge nation.

“You can see that the tidal wave is coming,” Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan who models India’s outbreak, told The Post in March. “It would be foolish to be in denial.”

Some countries have seen success at controlling the virus. In New Zealand, which closed its borders and ordered people to stay home as a first wave hit in the spring, confirmed infections went down to zero for a time. Taiwan and Singapore have kept their outbreaks far smaller than those in other parts of the world, which some experts attribute to their early responses and sophisticated tracking and tracing.

China, the early epicenter of the crisis, has seen much of daily life return to normal. In the early months of the outbreak, it reported more cases than any other country. Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February of 2020 and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data.

Wuhan, the virus’s initial epicenter, ground to a standstill in January 2020 as the coronavirus spiraled out of control. But after months without a confirmed case of domestic transmission, about 1.4 million children in the city returned to classrooms at the start of September, and crowded events have resumed.

Countries that have successfully rolled out vaccines are also seeing important gains. Britain, one of the hardest-hit countries in terms of cases and deaths, has excelled in the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. It was the first country to rollout a fully tested vaccine to the general public in December, when it began distributing the vaccine developed by Pfizer and Moderna.

Data released by Public Health England in March suggested that that vaccinations had saved over 6,000 lives among people over 70, if not more.

Israel, which has seen several waves of the virus, had raced ahead of other nations and given the first doses of Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine to more than a third of its population by the end of January. Data from data Israel indicated that the Pfizer vaccine was around 94 percent effective at stopping asymptomatic infection.

Early signs from the country suggest that the large scale of vaccinations have had an impact on the spread of the virus.

“We say with caution, the magic has started,” Eran Segal, a data scientist with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, tweeted on Feb. 1. Segal pointed to declines in new cases, hospitalizations and the number of seriously ill.

But global health experts have cautioned that despite the success of vaccines, the virus remains a potent threat and returning to normal life too early could ultimately extend the length of the pandemic and lead to fresh new cases.

""There is a lot of frustration and fatigue out there wanting this pandemic to be over, but with transmission increasing, it’s going in the wrong direction,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s covid-19 technical lead, said at a media briefing on March 31. “This is far from over. We’re not talking about a handful of cases here and there. We are still in the acute phase of the pandemic.”",

FoodSafety.gov recommends using refrigerated eggs or yolks within 2 to 4 days.

Whites freeze well for up to 1 year. Collect in a zip-top bag or reusable container, marking how many are inside, as well as weight if you have a scale. You can collect as you go, until you reach the right amount for whatever you want to make. Yolks are trickier to put on ice, as they turn thicker and more syrupy. If you do still want to freeze the yolks, the USDA suggests mixing 4 yolks with a pinch of salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar or corn syrup.

And now to the recipes, which are an extensive, if not comprehensive, collection of ideas from our archives.

The Smithsonian and National Gallery of Art are still closed. Here’s what’s open.,"But after a rise in positive cases in November, the Smithsonian and National Gallery announced they would close again. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum followed. None has announced when visitors might return.

Now that spring is here, however, there are signs that museums are coming back to life. The International Spy Museum and the Museum of the Bible reopened in January. The National Gallery of Art’s Sculpture Garden reopened on Valentine’s Day. The first week of March brought the reopenings of the Phillips Collection, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Hillwood and the grounds of Glenstone. The National Building Museum, Glenstone’s indoor Gallery, Planet Word and Tudor Place all announced early April reopenings.

Whether visiting an indoor museum or an outdoor exhibition, social distancing and other precautions are of paramount importance. Remember to check websites and social media, as many attractions are operating with shortened hours, and not all exhibits may be open.

This list will be updated as more institutions announce their plans.

Fully reopened

American Visionary Art Museum: The eccentric Baltimore museum, which champions the art of everyday people with more passion than training, reopened Sept. 25 after more than six months of closure. Capacity is limited to twenty-five percent, and purchase of advance timed tickets is required. All galleries are open, including “The Science and Mystery of Sleep,” an exhibition featuring “fantastical, handmade bedrooms created by three visionary artists as personal refuge” according to the museum, which opened in October. Open Wednesday to Sunday. $9.95-$15.95.

Artechouse: Melding interactive art with cutting-edge technology, Artechouse is a much different experience than the museums a few blocks away on the Mall. New installation “Renewal 2121″ places visitors a century into the future, “in an industrial city where nature fights to survive amid an overdeveloped metropolis.” Capacity is limited, and timed-admission tickets are required. Open daily. $17-$24.

B&O Railroad Museum: A museum known for hands-on activities, including actual train rides on the historic One Mile Express, might not be the first place you think of going right now, but Baltimore’s B&O Railroad Museum is working hard to keep the facility safe. Masks and social distancing are required, including limiting seating and arranging spacing on the train. The children’s area is “cleaned throughout the day and is deep-cleaned each night,” while high-touch areas are cleaned multiple times a day. Open daily. $12-$20.

Hillwood Estate and Gardens: Marjorie Merriweather Post’s Northwest D.C. estate reopened to the public on March 2. Capacity is limited to help with social distancing, so visitors are required to make separate timed-entry reservations for the 25-acre gardens, the mansion and exhibitions. (There’s no additional fee for admission to the mansion, but anyone who doesn’t make an advanced mansion reservation will not be allowed to enter the building.) No in-person tours are offered at this time, so download the Hillwood app for guided tours of the mansion and gardens before a visit. Open Tuesday through Sunday. $5-$18. Ages 5 and younger free.

International Spy Museum: The museum, which moved to an expansive new building in L’Enfant Plaza in 2019, reopened Jan. 23 with a limited capacity and extra distancing. (The museum now recommends a minimum of two hours to explore.) Many of the interactive elements have been modified to reduce contact, but some elements are temporarily closed — including the sections in which visitors crawl through an air duct, and attempt to escape East Berlin by hiding in a Trabant. However, staff members have created alternatives in the space: The Trabant on display has a mannequin demonstrating the contortions needed to fit into a hidden space in the car. Open daily. $16.95-$24.95. Ages 6 and younger free.

The Kreeger Museum: The Kreeger is one of the most beautiful museums in Washington and contains a collection to match, including important Impressionists and members of the Washington Color School, and displays of African, Asian and pre-Columbian art. For its reopening on April 1, the Kreeger welcomes visitors to its galleries for four 50-minute timed-entry slots per day, beginning at 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., and limiting capacity to no more than 15 people per hour. When the 50 minutes are up, visitors are directed outside to the sculpture garden, which includes works of art along a wooded trail. Visitors who don’t wish to spend time indoors are allowed to proceed directly to the sculpture garden. Open Tuesday to Saturday. Suggested donation $10 adults, $8 students, military and seniors.

Museum of the Bible: The Museum of the Bible reopened on Jan. 29. Procedures to limit contact and encourage social distancing have been in effect since the museum initially reopened in June 2020: Most of the interactive exhibits have remained open, along with the Milk and Honey Cafe, while the Virtual Reality Tour of the Lands of the Bible and the hands-on children’s area are closed. Visitors receive styluses to use with touch screens, and are asked to download museum maps to their phones instead of picking up paper copies. Advance tickets are recommended. Open daily. $9.99-$19.99. Ages 6 and younger free.

National Aquarium: Sharks, puffins and golden lion tamarins continue to delight generations of visitors at the National Aquarium in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. The aquarium reopened July 1 with new social distancing policies: Capacity is limited to 25 percent of the building’s occupancy, admission is by timed-entry tickets, and some exhibits, such as the touch pools, are temporarily closed. Visitors must wear masks and have their temperatures checked. Open daily. $29.95-$39.95. Ages 2 and younger free.

National Building Museum: The National Building Museum closed “temporarily” in December 2019 for renovations to the iconic Great Hall. Then came the coronavirus, and finally, 16 months later, it will reopen to the public on April 9. In addition to the permanent exhibitions, there are three new exhibits, including the Gun Violence Memorial Project — four glass houses filled with objects remembering victims of gun violence. Open Friday through Sunday. $10 adults, $7 youth, students and seniors.

National Museum of Women in the Arts: The museum reopened March 3 for in-person visits and the debut of “Sonya Clark: Tatter, Bristle, and Mend,” a retrospective looking at the artist’s quarter-century of creating mixed-media works. However, it is keeping a mix of virtual and in-person programming for the time being. Open daily. $8-$10; Ages 18 and younger admitted free.

The Phillips Collection: America’s first modern art museum reopened March 6, along with “Seeing Differently,” a centennial exhibition drawing from the permanent collection. Timed tickets for the upcoming week will become available each Monday at 10 a.m. for members and at noon for the public. To keep visitors distanced, only six people can enter the museum every 15 minutes, and admission is capped at 150 people per day. Free admission is offered for a limited time as part of a “Special Reopening Promotion.” Open Thursday through Sunday. Free admission available; regular admission $10-$16.

Planet Word: Planet Word, an interactive museum dedicated to exploring and having fun with language, opened in the historic Franklin School building on Franklin Square in October. It closed the following month, and reopened its doors April 1. Admission is limited to 35 visitors per hour, with advance reservations required, and styluses are provided for use with the many touch screens throughout the building. Open Thursday through Saturday. Free.

Tudor Place: This grand house, on a five-acre Georgetown hilltop, was designed by William Thornton, the architect of the U.S. Capitol, for Martha Washington’s granddaughter, and completed in 1816. It has been a museum since the 1980s, but the gardens — a place of respite with circular boxwood hedges, a profusion of roses and old tulip poplar trees dotting a landscaped “natural” lawn — have become the real destination for those who live or work in the neighborhood. Tudor Place reopens its house and gardens to the public on April 10 with free, timed tickets for self-guided indoor and outdoor tours. Picnics are welcome. Open Saturday and Sunday. Free; donations accepted.

Partially reopened

Glenstone: The much-buzzed-about Potomac art museum reopens its Gallery on April 8 with a major exhibit on artist Faith Ringgold, and its indoor pavilions on May 6. The 300 acres of grounds, dotted with sculptures by Richard Serra, Michael Heizer and Jeff Koons, among other contemporary artists, reopened to visitors as “an outdoor experience” on March 4. Tickets for visits in April were made available Feb. 15, and are now full. Open Thursday through Sunday. Free, reservations required. Tickets can be reserved up to one month in advance, with a new batch of tickets released at 10 a.m. on the first of the month. (For example, tickets for the month of May were released on April 1.

Maryland Zoo: It’s hard to say who was more excited about the Maryland Zoo’s June 2020 reopening: the human visitors or the animals they’d come to see. “On the first day, the penguins were all lined up against the glass,” a Zoo spokesperson told the Baltimore Sun. “The chimps were lined up, too. I think visitors provide them a little entertainment.” Among the Zoo’s new precautions: Requiring timed-entry reservations to prevent overcrowding, a limit of 25 percent of capacity for indoor areas, such as the Giraffe House, and mandating a one-way flow through the grounds. Open daily. $18-$22.

AD

Mount Vernon: George Washington’s historic estate became one of the first major attractions to reopen in the Washington area in June 2020. Social-distancing rules mean visitors must reserve tickets for timed guided tours of the first floor of the mansion, and the upper floors remain closed. Still, the family-friendly museum is open, minus the theaters and hands-on history area, and all 160 acres of the grounds are accessible, including the gardens, slave cabins, farming demonstrations and the first president’s tomb. (The distillery is closed, and will open in spring.) Capacity is limited, so advance ticket purchase is recommended. Open daily. $10-$18. Ages 5 and younger free.

AD

Workhouse Arts Center: The sprawling campus, formerly the Lorton Correctional Complex, is home to artist studios and hosts special events, including drive-in movies and comedy. The Lucy Burns Museum, which opened in early 2020, tells the stories of the suffragists who were sent here after being arrested for picketing and protesting at the White House in 1917. The brutal treatment they suffered, including assaults by guards on what became known as “The Night of Terror,” shocked the public. Exhibitions also discuss the site’s later years as a prison. The museum is open Saturdays from noon to 5 p.m., while studios are open from noon to 5 p.m. Friday through Sunday. Free.

Outdoor areas only

Please note that access to facilities, such as restrooms and cafes, is limited. Check before going.

Anacostia Community Museum: With Smithsonian museums closed due to the coronavirus, the Anacostia Community Museum was forced to reimagine its planned “Men of Change” exhibition. Instead of an indoor gallery with original art depicting Romare Bearden, Muhammed Ali and other Black trailblazers, “Men of Change” has moved to the great outdoors, with large, thematic mounted displays on streets and walkways around the Deanwood Recreation Center and Ron Brown High School. With in-person tours off the table, the museum has planned a series of virtual programs, as well as a self-guided audio tour of the exhibit, which includes voices of Ron Brown students. Through May 31. Free.

Annmarie Sculpture Garden and Arts Center: It’s not often that a walk in the woods leads to a modern sculpture by Jules Olitski, Minoru Niizuma or Gerhard Marcks, but that’s what makes the Annmarie Sculpture Garden in Solomons, Md., one of the area’s most engaging art experiences. Visitors to the 30-acre sculpture garden follow trails winding past clearings and under the trees. Sometimes the art is next to the path, and sometimes it’s first seen from a distance. With areas for children, including a riverside playhouse; plant displays; and a separate “Women’s Walk” looking at bronze female forms, this is a garden that appeals to many different audiences. Family art classes have temporarily moved outside, while other art classes and events are now held virtually. Open daily. Suggested donation $5.

Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden: After five months of closure, the Hirshhorn’s sunken Sculpture Garden reopened on the Mall on Aug. 17. Two new works have joined more than 30 pieces already on display: “We Come in Peace,” a female figure with five faces that stands more than 12-feet-tall by Huma Bhabha — whose title references the 1951 sci-fi film “The Day the Earth Stood Still” — and Sterling Ruby’s “Double Candle,” a pair of monumental bronze candles. While other Smithsonian museums shuttered again, the Hirshhorn’s garden will be open daily, subject to capacity limits, and masks must be worn by all visitors aged 6 and older. The museum’s plaza and interior remain closed. Open daily. Free.

Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens: Known for the summer display of lotuses and waterlilies, this large collection of water gardens and marshland is one of Washington’s outdoor treasures throughout the year. As with many parks, portions of the Aquatic Gardens are closed to encourage social distancing, and the restrooms are unavailable. But the river walk and other trails are open, and photo opportunities abound. Open daily. Free.

National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden: The National Gallery’s beloved sculpture garden on the Mall reopened on Feb. 14, while the Gallery’s East and West buildings remain closed. There are shorter hours (11 a.m. to 4 p.m., daily), limited capacity (a maximum of 271 visitors) and a new traffic flow, but those are minor inconveniences when you just want to enjoy fresh air and art by Tony Smith, Barry Flanagan and Louise Bourgeois. The Pavilion Cafe serves snacks, coffee, beer and wine. Open daily. Free.

U.S. National Arboretum: After two reopening periods with limited hours, the Arboretum’s 446 acres of gardens, trees and trails are now open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Some attractions, such as the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum and the Visitors Center, remain closed. Open daily. Free.",2020-06-26 00:00:00
"Calculate how much you would get from the $1,400 (or more) coronavirus checks","Calculate how much you would get from the $1,400 (or more) coronavirus checks

A third round of stimulus checks, part of the Biden administration’s “American Rescue Plan,” has been signed into law.

Use the calculator below to see how large a check you’ll receive. If you’ve already filed your 2020 taxes, the check will most likely be based on that income. If you haven’t, it will be based on your 2019 taxes.

The $1.9 trillion bill looks a little different from the legislation originally approved by the House. Provisions for increasing the minimum wage to $15 were struck down by the Senate parliamentarian, and the income eligibility for stimulus payments was narrowed.

[What’s in the Senate’s $1.9 trillion covid bill: Checks, unemployment insurance and more]

Americans with income below a certain threshold — $75,000 for individuals, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for couples filing jointly — will each receive $1,400 per person as a direct deposit or mailed check. Households will receive an additional $1,400 for each dependent claimed on their most recent tax filings.

What’s different this time

At $1,400 per individual, this will be the largest stimulus check yet for most Americans. The first round paid $1,200, and the second paid $600. Before the Georgia Senate runoff, Biden pushed for a $2,000 stimulus payment. His administration now considers the latest bill and the December checks to be part of the same round of stimulus, for a total of $2,000.

[Calculate how much you would get from the expanded child tax credit]

As with the last two payments, some Americans will get a partial check if their income is above the threshold. However, these amounts will phase out much faster than in the past two coronavirus relief bills. That means that some Americans who received money in the first two rounds of checks won’t get anything this time.

Stimulus check phaseout for single tax filers

[Biden stimulus showers money on Americans, sharply cutting poverty in defining move of presidency]

The narrowed eligibility was a concession from Biden to moderate Democrats, whose votes were needed for passage of the bill in a closely divided Senate.

Dependents will get the same amount as adults. The first round gave just $500 per child dependent vs. $1,200 for adults, while the second round gave $600 checks to both. Dependents that are 17 or older are also included in this round of stimulus.

In addition to the stimulus checks, the massive economic package extends unemployment benefits into September, increases the child tax credit, and reserves billions for state and local aid, coronavirus testing and vaccinations, and other provisions such as rental aid and food assistance.

Men’s Final Four: Four stats that will decide the semifinals,"Will Gonzaga join them? Perhaps. In January we estimated the Bulldogs had an 11 percent chance to finish the regular season undefeated, the best chance of any team since 2014-15, and they have continued rolling in the NCAA tournament. Using the same method from a few months ago puts Gonzaga’s likelihood of a perfect season at 58 percent, no matter who wins the other Final Four semifinal between Baylor and Houston.

AD

AD

That’s not the only number worth focusing on for this year’s Final Four. Here are a few more that are sure to factor into the chase for the national championship.

No. 1 Gonzaga vs. No. 11 UCLA

64 percent: Gonzaga’s field goal rate on two-point attempts, the best all-time per Pomeroy’s calculations.

Joel Ayayi is scoring almost three-fourths of the time on drives to the basket. So is Anton Watson. Corey Kispert is successful on two-thirds of his put-backs off the offensive glass, averaging 1.4 points per possession. On plays around the basket, the Bulldogs average 1.4 points per possession, the best in men’s college hoops. They are close to that production, 1.3 points per possession, in the low post. And if that’s not enough, they hit 40 percent of their jump shots within 16 feet of the basket. The Bulldogs are lethal when they get the ball inside.

USC, the best defense against two-point shots in 2020-21 (42 percent field goal rate against), allowed Gonzaga to score on 26 of 45 (58 percent) two-point attempts. UCLA’s defense is coming into this game allowing a success rate of nearly 50 percent.

AD

AD

18.9 seconds: Average offensive possession length for UCLA.

The Bruins like to take their time on offense, allowing the shot clock to wind down almost 19 seconds per offensive possession. The benefit is an efficient offense, one that scores 116.2 points per 100 possessions after adjusting for opponent (13th best per Pomeroy). However, it leaves them vulnerable against Gonzaga and its fast-paced offense (14 seconds per average offensive possession). How much of an impact could tempo have on this game?

If the tempo is closer to how the Bulldogs like it, 70 possessions or more, the Bruins could be looking at a deficit of 16 points or more. If UCLA can keep the tempo closer to its preferred terms, less than 70 possessions, the Bruins project to be outscored by 12 points, making an upset slightly more likely (but still improbable). The slower the tempo, the better chance UCLA has to pull out a win.

No. 1 Baylor vs. No. 2 Houston

25 percent: Baylor’s turnover rate on defense

AD

AD

Baylor’s defense has been on full display all season. The Bears allow 92.2 points per 100 possessions after adjusting for strength of schedule (28th best in the nation per Pomeroy’s rankings), and when their shots weren’t falling against Villanova in the Sweet 16 they held an otherwise efficient Wildcats offense to a mere 51 points on 66 possessions.

The key to the victory was turnovers. Baylor forced Villanova to commit 16 (the Wildcats entered the game averaging 8.8 turnovers, the lowest mark in Division I men’s basketball) with five different Villanova players committing two or more. Baylor then forced 15 turnovers against Arkansas in the Elite Eight, six on senior Jalen Tate alone, helping secure the school’s first Final Four berth since 1950.

Houston’s offense has been forced to commit turnovers on 20 percent or more of its possessions 13 times this season, losing just one of those contests. However, the best of those teams, Memphis, was ranked no higher than 31st in the country per Pomeroy’s rankings, whereas Baylor ranks No. 2 heading into this matchup.

35 percent: Percentage of half-court possessions that produced points against Houston

The Cougars know how to limit an opponent’s offense. Coach Kelvin Sampson has his squad entering the Final Four with the sixth-best defense in the country, allowing just 88.4 points per 100 after adjusting for strength of schedule. They will need to be at the top of their game to contend with Baylor’s offense, the third-most efficient of 2020-21.

Houston’s biggest edge is in the half-court. The team doesn’t give quality shots to spot-up shooters (31 percent field goal rate against), nor does it allow the ballhandler on the pick-and-roll to get much space. Those two play types accounted for nearly 42 percent of Baylor’s possessions this year.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"While Gonzaga has crushed its foes, Indiana had close calls on its way to perfection in 1976","Well, the funny thing about those Hoosiers (32-0) who went wire-to-wire at No. 1 is their dissimilarity to Gonzaga, which has gone wire-to-almost-wire at No. 1 this season and aims to equal Indiana at this Final Four. The Bulldogs (30-0) famously have won by double digits every time but one, which might not be fun for their victims but at least spares them walking around life wincing every now and then about the what-ifs. Regarding Bob Knight’s most famous team, it can be striking to anyone who didn’t live in Indiana or follow the team game by game to go poring into the details of game accounts.

They had a rugged schedule and hairy occasions.

“They were prepared, and they were tough,” said Wayman Britt, 66, who captained the Michigan team that lost thrice to Indiana, including in the national championship game, and who will retire in July as the County Administrator of Kent County, Mich.

They weren’t escapists per se, but they faced and then solved problem after problem, which might seem more impressive than the routs.

“That was a great team, no question about it,” Britt said. “They were stout. They had a system. Rock-solid.” Also: “They could have been beaten.”

Their fans’ nerve endings took a serial fraying, and their opponents a serial replaying.

“Aw, man, I replay that stuff all the time,” Britt said.

He joins those players from that season who can relive the ITAL almosts END every time they hear a mention of Indiana 1975-76. Indiana’s 32 games included 11 decided by single digits, which included two decided by five points, one by four, two by three, one by two and two in overtime — against Kentucky in Louisville’s Freedom Hall on Dec. 15, and against Michigan in Indiana’s Assembly Hall on Feb. 7.

Those last two, wins Nos. 4 and 19, shared a strange and frenzied trait. Both saw Indiana down by two with regulation time about to croak. Both saw Indiana tie the game on freakish follows by 6-foot-10 center Kent Benson. Kentucky led 64-62 with nine seconds left until Benson’s tap-in for which he “stuck a hand barely more than waist-high,” as wrote the estimable Bob Hammel of the Bloomington Herald-Telephone. After Michigan led 39-29 at halftime and 55-47 with 9:35 left, it led 60-58 with the end straight ahead and the action frantic, when Quinn Buckner missed from up top and Jim Crews shrewdly redirected the ball from the left baseline across the basket to Benson on the right for a putback.

Should Benson’s tap have counted as a controlled shot, which mattered in the rules for buzzer-beaters? Did he go over Phil Hubbard’s back and warrant a whistle that never, ever, ever would have come with the crowd and Knight both against the idea?

People — get this — disagree.

Here’s Britt, who often stopped to laugh during these passages: “Benson over the top of Phil Hubbard. … We got letters from all over the country about that. … They should have waved that off. Tragic. Tragic. Yeah, we got robbed.” … “A tough pill to swallow because we knew we were that good. Knight knew it, too. Before the game he was telling us how great we were.” … “A hostile environment. Doing to them what they didn’t want to have done. Everybody’s against you. The refs. That fan base always was. Knight just had the environment controlled.”

And then this: “The tip-in. That’s the essence of the game right there, like, ‘What in the world?’ Benson comes over the top and tips that thing in, and they didn’t call it. Come on. If we could do it all over again, I’d bet you a hundred bucks we would beat them.” He paused. “Because I’d take more shots,” for one thing.

Indiana played that season as one of those occasional sports teams motivated by a horror that concluded a previous year — in this case, the 92-90 loss to Kentucky in the 1975 Mideast Region final in Dayton that left the Hoosiers 31-1 and made them wonder what might have been had the great Scott May not broken his arm in late February.

In its 1975-76 mission, it had other inconveniences:

It had to go to a stall — a stall! — to hold off a charging Notre Dame, 63-60, back when college basketball had no shot clock and people would sit around watching stalls. It trailed St. John’s 65-63 in Madison Square Garden before winning, 76-69. It never led Ohio State by more than six in Columbus, traded off a missed layup and won, 66-64. It won, 80-74, always close, at Michigan. It trailed Purdue 60-59 with 6:30 left at Bloomington and won, 71-67, and trailed Purdue 27-16 in West Lafayette, Ind., and won, 74-71.

In a Mideast Region semifinal in Baton Rouge, with a banner on the scorer’s table clunkily reading “GO TIGERS,” Coach C.M. Newton’s excellent SEC champions from Alabama led 69-68 before May hit a 17-footer with 2:02 left. Final score: 74-69.

In a case of the teams ranked Nos. 1 and 2 playing each other in a regional final because people had no idea what they were doing back then, Indiana led Marquette only 57-54 before seeing a good-looking Bo Ellis shot for Marquette roll off with 51 seconds left, then making free throws to win, 65-56, as play-by-play man Don Fischer acknowledged the moment the Hoosiers surpassed the stage of their 1975 nightmare. “I want to tell you, everybody right here at the table with us is just shaking,” he said in the broadcast. “A tremendous emotional win for Indiana.”

And then, win No. 32, in Philadelphia: At 17:17 of the first half, Indiana had a mainstay, the 6-foot-7 senior Bobby Wilkerson, take an inadvertent elbow and wind up motionless on the floor. He went off on a stretcher, got a diagnosis of a concussion and ended up at Temple University Hospital. Indiana had a 35-29 deficit at halftime, a 51-51 tie with 10 minutes left.

It won the rest by 35-17 to close at 86-68. As May told reporters that night: “We’ve been behind before. We’re used to it.” As Britt said: “I don’t know. There’s a number of things, man. You know, people get momentum. They start to click, if you will. They start to see things and make the adjustments, and that’s what happens.”

Unlike with this Gonzaga team thus far, the margins had been so small so often. To this day, 45 years on, it makes Britt pinpoint one factor: Indiana’s place back then at the vanguard of fitness training.

“We weren’t doing that,” Britt said. “We only had a leg weight machine. They were physically more styled. We were just quick. We didn’t do that [the level of training]. They had started that.” So: “I’d run a few more miles. I’d do a few more push-ups. I’d go to bed earlier than I did. That’s what I would do to make sure I was ready. We did not develop the science of basketball to the extent we could have, back in the day. … You look at that team and how strong they were: Benson, May, Buckner. These guys were hefty. Hefty. Very mature, strong people. They were men. We didn’t have that. We had some skinny guys — quick, talented” — and younger.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"When Houston and Baylor meet in the Final Four, it will be father vs. son on the sidelines","Brooks had no interest in following his dad into coaching. He didn’t want those tortuous nights. Brooks’s dad didn’t think his son would coach either. Brooks excelled academically, eventually earning a degree in finance, and he’s a “numbers guy,” his dad said.

“But you can't stop what you love,” the younger Brooks said.

So he started coaching at the junior college level, where he thrived, before moving up to Division I and then onto the staffs at major-conference programs. Brooks is in his fifth season as an assistant at Baylor, just a couple hundred miles from the Houston campus where he watched his dad lead a program. Houston fired the elder Brooks in 1998, and he bounced around as an assistant for various programs. But in 2010, he returned to Houston as an assistant coach and worked with his hometown team. Once Houston’s run in the tournament ends, he will become the head coach at his alma mater, Lamar University, the school announced Thursday.

AD

After decades-long Final Four droughts, both Houston and Baylor have been on the rise. The father and son promised one another they would be there to watch if the other reached that hallowed final weekend of the NCAA tournament. They both will be at Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday for the national semifinals, but neither will watch from the stands. No. 1 seed Baylor and No. 2 Houston both advanced, sending the two Brooks assistants to the Final Four, where their teams will compete for a spot in the national title game.

“To get to the Final Four in the same year and then you guys are going to play each other in the very first semifinal game, just unbelievable,” the elder Brooks said. “It’s amazing. … Whoever imagined that we would both be there and we’re going to be at the other end of each other’s bench?”

The father and son talk daily — during the season and in the offseason — about basketball and their teams. With the semifinal matchup approaching, they kept conversations a bit more limited. They have been flooded with messages from relatives asking for tickets. One family member made T-shirts with the colors of both teams. The elder Brooks said his wife, Richelle, is handling it well, but “because Al’s the beloved son, he always gets preferential treatment.” The younger Brooks still thinks his mom will wear red to represent the Cougars.

After college, Alvin Brooks III worked in finance. “I was chasing money, to be honest with you,” he said. “I thought I was going to manage athletes’ money and be a millionaire.” Brooks is close friends with former NBA player Rashard Lewis, and they were both in Seattle at the time. Brooks said he was miserable in his job. He would go watch SuperSonics practices and games. He paid attention to the coaches and thought to himself: “Man, I could do this. That’s not a job.” Brooks told his dad he wanted to pursue coaching.

“Call me back in two weeks,” his dad said.

During that time, Brooks attended nearly every Sonics practice and was convinced. His dad knew he loved basketball but wasn’t sure that would extend to coaching, which involves far more than the game. The elder Brooks didn’t tell his son he had a Division I coaching opportunity through a friend of his, because he wanted him to climb up the ranks. “No, he can’t accept that. He ain’t ready,” Brooks told his friend. “He needs to go figure out what to do.”

Brooks took a job as an assistant at Arkansas Fort Smith, a small program that forced him to wear many hats. He unlocked the recreation center at 4 a.m. every day and walked players to class. His dad called after a few weeks, asking how he liked it, assuming his son would have realized he didn’t want to coach. Instead, he said he loved it.

AD

“Oh, my gosh,” his dad said, “this dude’s going to be in it.”

In Brooks’s second season at Arkansas Fort Smith, the team won the 2006 junior college national title. Brooks then moved to Midland College, another junior college, and that team won the title the next year. Now with Baylor under Coach Scott Drew, the Bears have reached the Final Four for the first time since 1950. They probably would have been a No. 1 seed in last year’s tournament, too, if it hadn’t been canceled. NCAA rules limit recruiting visits more so now than in the past, so Brooks is home with his kids more than his dad was, but sometimes after losses, Brooks finds himself staying late at the team facility.

Brooks is 0-2 against his dad; when he was at Sam Houston State from 2010 to 2012, his team lost to the Cougars twice. (Houston and Baylor held a preseason scrimmage to raise money for hurricane relief in 2017, and the younger Brooks’s Bears lost that game, too.) But this season, they both have been part of impressive rebuilding success stories. Until this season, Houston hadn’t reached the Elite Eight since the 1984 Phi Slama Jama team.

Once the NCAA tournament field was announced this month, the elder Brooks realized the father-son Final Four matchup was possible if both teams won their region. As much as coaches preach the one-game-at-a-time mentality, he briefly let himself look ahead. The final step to reaching that moment came Monday in the Elite Eight, with the two teams playing back-to-back games and the Cougars defeating Oregon State first. As Brooks celebrated with his Houston players on the court, the arena video boards showed the Baylor game happening on the other side of a curtain at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Bears had a comfortable lead over Arkansas, and the Houston team headed back to the hotel.

AD

Once Brooks returned to a television, Baylor’s cushion had been cut to four points. Brooks needed to walk away. He felt far more stress watching his son’s team than when coaching a comparable game himself. But the Bears survived and celebrated. The father and son FaceTimed from the court.

“Guys coach their whole career and never get here,” the elder Brooks said. “So now to finally get here and then have this special moment to actually have your son share it and then he’s with his team? Could not imagine it.”",2021-04-01 00:00:00
"The transfer portal has taken Houston, Baylor, Gonzaga and UCLA to the Final Four","A former Kansas Jayhawk (Quentin Grimes) scored more points than any other Houston player in its four wins on the path to the national semifinals. In Sampson’s system, which values rebounding as much as scoring, a former Towson Tiger (Justin Gorham) has grabbed the most boards during his team’s extended Indianapolis stay. And the leading assist man? That’s DeJon Jarreau, formerly a Massachusetts Minuteman, who also happens to be the team’s best defender.

The second-seeded Cougars, with four transfers in their starting lineup and two more on the roster, are an extreme example of a program that leans on players from elsewhere. But they’re also a reflection of their peers, both in the men’s Final Four and across the college basketball landscape, as players take advantage of more freedom to transfer and programs embrace how those athletes can be valuable additions.

AD

AD

“Thirty years ago, people that didn’t know what they didn’t know turned their nose up at transfers,” Sampson said. “They thought something was wrong with them. It shows you how little they knew, though. Now, if you’re not taking transfers, you’re behind.”

After Sampson led his group to Houston’s first Final Four since 1984, another Elite Eight matchup began at Lucas Oil Stadium on the other side of a curtain. In that game, another team from Texas with a handful of transfers — top-seeded Baylor — moved on, too. MaCio Teague, formerly of UNC Asheville, hit a pair of pivotal three-pointers late in the second half. Davion Mitchell, who used to play for Auburn, has been the Bears’ defensive stopper all season. They led Baylor to its first Final Four since 1950, and they did so by beating an Arkansas team that Sampson had referred to as “Transfer U” earlier in the tournament. These players — Teague and Mitchell; Grimes, Gorham and Jarreau — are no longer outliers.

In Saturday’s Final Four matchups, eight of the 20 projected starters from Gonzaga, Baylor, Houston and UCLA will be transfers. With more than 1,000 players reportedly already in the transfer portal this year, these Final Four squads are perhaps a glimpse of what future college rosters will look like.

AD

AD

From 2011 to 2015, the Final Four never featured more than one transfer starter. That total gradually grew in recent seasons, with five in 2018. That season, each national semifinalist had at least one transfer who started, and Loyola Chicago, the Cinderella team of the tournament, had two. Now, with transferring becoming more common and all players granted immediately eligibility this season because of the pandemic, that number has surged. The NCAA is soon expected to approve a rule change that allows all players to transfer once without sitting out for a year, as they were previously required to, meaning the effects of the transfer boom won’t be fully apparent until future seasons.

“It’s been a long time since anybody’s gone on the road recruiting,” Sampson said. “Transfer portal is like a menu. You’ve got appetizers and desserts. You’ve got your entrees. You kind of just say, ‘What do you need?’ It’s like one-stop shopping looking at that transfer portal.”

Even for UCLA and Gonzaga, which have only one transfer starter apiece, the new additions elevated their programs. Sophomore guard Johnny Juzang (a former Kentucky Wildcat) has powered the Bruins through the tournament, averaging 21.6 points since his 11th-seeded team began in the First Four round.

AD

AD

During the tournament runs of these Final Four participants, transfers have scored nearly 40 percent of their teams’ points and have accounted for a similar proportion of minutes. Those contributions peaked in the Elite Eight, when transfers scored 64 percent of Baylor’s points, 58 percent of Houston’s points and 55 percent of UCLA’s points. The production during the tournament is comparable to season-long data, too.

Gonzaga, the overall No. 1 seed, has a star freshman point guard in Jalen Suggs and a senior all-American forward in Corey Kispert. Other key players have developed in the program for a few years, but Andrew Nembhard recently joined the team from the University of Florida. When Coach Mark Few was still hoping that Nembhard would receive a waiver to play this season, he met with some of his standout players. Few said he asked Suggs how he felt about adding another guard to the fold.

“He just got the biggest grin on his face,” Few said. “I’ll remember it the rest of my life. He was like: ‘Coach, are you kidding me? That would be awesome.’ I’ve found over the years the real players, they don’t fear anybody. They welcome all great players around them.”

AD

AD

Few told his staff he believed the addition of Nembhard took the Bulldogs from being a top-20 team into the top five, where they could compete for a national title. Nembhard only averages 9.1 points in a high-pace Gonzaga offense that includes four players with better scoring outputs. Nembhard didn’t settle into a starting role until late this season, but he was the team’s second-leading scorer (17 points) in its Sweet 16 win over No. 5 seed Creighton.

“I don’t think he gets talked about enough,” Suggs said. “Man, he’s good.”

There’s no precise formula to build a program. “There’s only your way,” Sampson said. “Whatever way you believe in and it works, then that’s a good way.” For some of these teams, especially Houston and Baylor, transfers have been the answer.

AD

Teague and Mitchell talked before they arrived on Baylor’s campus, and Mitchell says he’s the reason Teague chose the Bears. Teague remembers his soon-to-be teammate saying, if he came to Baylor, together they could reach the Final Four.

"Arizona stuns Connecticut, advances to first national championship game","McDonald finished with 26 points on 7-for-17 shooting and added six rebounds. Arizona limited the Huskies (28-2) to 36 percent shooting. Connecticut came in leading the country in field goal shooting (52 percent) and was ranked fourth in scoring offense, averaging 82.7 points.

“I didn’t do anything different. I just kept playing my game, taking what the defense is giving me,” McDonald said. “I wanted to see how they played me. It’s not checkers. This is chess, so I’m always the next step ahead of my opponent. Nothing different, I’m just going to keep playing my game.”

Arizona, which led for all but 41 seconds, made 8 of 10 free throws down the stretch to seal the victory for a team that, before this season, had never advanced beyond the round of 16 in the NCAA tournament.

Connecticut never got closer than five points in the closing stages in losing for the fourth straight time in the national semifinals.

“I don’t take for granted how hard it is to get here. It’s very hard,” said Arizona Coach Adia Barnes. “All the chips have to fall, all the stars have to be aligned. All those things have to happen, and I’m just glad it happened to us. I’m glad that we got momentum when we needed it, and we’re playing some good basketball. I think we’re very lucky and fortunate to be here.""

Christyn Williams led the Huskies with 20 points before fouling out in the fourth quarter. Paige Bueckers added 18 points, but the first freshman to be selected national player of the year struggled throughout the game to get clean looks against Arizona’s pressure.

The Wildcats opened up a 41-29 lead via a 7-0 run in the third quarter after Connecticut had drawn within five points. Bendu Yeaney had two baskets for Arizona during the burst, and Trinity Baptiste made a three-pointer from the top of the arc to keep the Huskies on their heels.

The lead swelled to 48-34 with 1:37 left in the third quarter on Helena Pueyo’s jumper before Connecticut got back within single digits courtesy of Williams’s three-pointer and two free throws from Bueckers.

Connecticut’s path to its 13th consecutive Final Four and 21st overall came with some controversy after it escaped No. 2 seed Baylor, 69-67, in the River Walk Region finals Monday night.

With 18 seconds left in the fourth quarter and the Huskies ahead, 68-67, Williams missed two foul shots, and the Lady Bears’ NaLyssa Smith secured the rebound, leading to an immediate timeout from Baylor Coach Kim Mulkey.

The Lady Bears ran down the clock, and Dijonai Carrington attempted a jumper to tie. Connecticut’s Aaliyah Edwards blocked the shot while appearing to make contact with Carrington, but no foul was called. Williams grabbed the loose ball and was fouled, making the second of two free throws.

Social media buzzed with criticism, including a tweet from LeBron James, for the no-call on Carrington, and Mulkey voiced her displeasure during her postgame remarks

Arizona, meanwhile, earned its spot with a win over No. 4 seed Indiana, 66-53, in the regional finals on the way to its first Final Four in the fifth season under Barnes, a former Wildcats player.

Barnes also was making history on her own, joining South Carolina’s Dawn Staley to mark the first time two Black coaches had reached the Final Four in the same NCAA tournament.

The Wildcats opened the game as if they had been on the sport’s biggest stage before, getting 15 first-half points from McDonald and giving Connecticut fits defensively. The Huskies shot just 32 percent in the first half.

“We did not have any pressure,” said Barnes. “It’s a much easier situation to be us than it is U-Conn because the program is so good you’re expected to win, and that’s hard, We had a little bit of experience with that this year being a top 10 team or a top 12 team. It’s a little bit harder than being an unranked team chasing wins. For U-Conn there was more pressure. For us it’s a lot easier to play loose when there isn’t pressure.”

Connecticut trailed by as many as 12, 32-20, with 2:52 left in the first half when McDonald, playing with two personal fouls, connected on her fourth three-pointer.

Link copied link How they got here: Connecticut NCAA tournament results: High Point, 102-59; Syracuse, 83-47; Iowa, 92-72; Baylor, 69-67 Elite Eight: Connecticut’s win caused an avalanche of criticism after an apparent foul of Baylor’s DiJonai Carrington on a last-second shot went uncalled. How Connecticut can advance Post up Aari McDonald whenever possible: Arizona will need a herculean effort from star guard Aari McDonald to prevent the Huskies from advancing. Because the Huskies don’t have a player that matches up well with McDonald’s speed, creativity and ability to score from anywhere, Connecticut has to make her work when on defense. While the 5-foot 6-senior has proved to be a capable defender on the perimeter she’s had a difficult time defending post-ups. With Connecticut’s three main guards being listed at 5 foot 11 or taller, it makes sense to take McDonald down low and force her to exert extra energy. Continue to block out the noise: All tournament long, it’s always been something. First there were questions about Connecticut’s lack of experience, then people wondered if Connecticut had enough talent around AP player of the year Paige Bueckers to survive an off night and now the Huskies are the bad guys for reaping the benefits of a missed call. If Connecticut is to win its 12th national championship it will have to continue to block out that noise, because on paper the only thing in its way is itself. Quotable: “I don’t think LeBron has ever won a game on a bad call by the official, you think?

How Arizona can advance Can’t just be happy to be here: When the Wildcats take the court it’ll be a lot of firsts for the program, but they won’t have the luxury of drinking that in versus a Connecticut team with so much tradition. As it has done for much of the tournament, Arizona must embrace the underdog mind-set instead of taking it as a slight. Not being included in the NCAA’s promotional video for the Final Four should help from a motivational point of view. McDonald must dominate the matchup with Paige Bueckers: Because Arizona primarily plays its games on the Pac-12 Network — which is not easily accessible for much of the country — most people don’t realize just how good McDonald truly is. In the tournament, she’s averaging 25.3 points, 6.8 rebounds and 3 assists. McDonald’s supporting cast is limited offensively, so they’ll need every bit of what she can provide. With McDonald expected to guard Bueckers for much of the game, it’s vital that she not only outscores the AP player of the year but also locks her up on defense. If Bueckers prevails, it’s hard to imagine a scenario where Arizona wins. Quotable: “I re-watched it [the NCAA Final Four promotional video] a couple of times. It was frustrating. I definitely took it as a sign of disrespect.” — McDonald after the Wildcats were omitted from the NCAA’s Women’s Final Four hype video AD AD

Fighting through tears, Elizabeth Toledo, Adam’s mother, said Friday, “I just want to know what really happened to my baby.”

Adam is believed to be the youngest person fatally shot by Chicago police since at least 2015, according to The Washington Post’s database of police shootings.

Chicago police spokesman Michael Carroll told The Post the department could not comment beyond its news release and directed questions to COPA. The accountability office did not immediately return a request for comment Saturday.

Police responded to reports of gunfire in the Little Village neighborhood shortly after 2:30 a.m. Monday. When officers arrived at the 2300 block of South Sawyer Avenue, police said, they “observed two males in a nearby alley.” Chicago police said the two people, including one who was allegedly armed, then fled the scene, resulting in a foot pursuit by officers. During the “armed confrontation” in an alley, police said, an officer shot a person in the chest.

AD

Police did not identify the 13-year-old in their news release but said the person was pronounced dead at the scene. Tom Ahern, a Chicago police spokesman, shared a photo of a gun allegedly recovered by authorities. It remains unclear whether the gun was fired before the boy was shot, police told the Associated Press.

The other person who reportedly ran from the officers has been identified as 21-year-old Ruben Roman Jr., who was arrested and charged with resisting arrest, police said. Roman previously pleaded guilty to illegal gun possession and was sentenced to probation in 2019, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

When police knocked on the door of Toledo’s West Side home around 1 p.m. Wednesday, the 44-year-old homemaker believed they were responding to the missing report she filed on Adam. The mother of five told the Sun-Times that she had not seen her 13-year-old son since they attended a relative’s memorial service on Sunday.

AD

Instead, Toledo was informed her son might have been shot and asked by police to identify whether Adam’s body was at the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Nearly 60 hours after the early-morning encounter with police, the mother confirmed to the coroner that her son was dead.

Police spokesman Don Terry explained to the Chicago Tribune that law enforcement had no way of immediately identifying the boy because he was not carrying ID or a cellphone, and they were able to match his description with his missing persons report.

AD

Almost immediately, activists and critics called on the city to release the body-cam video of the police encounter that left a seventh-grader dead. But COPA initially said Thursday that the video would not be released, citing the Juvenile Court Act — an Illinois law that attorneys say has been rejected as an argument to withhold footage of minors in police shootings.

AD

The pressure heightened after COPA’s stance Thursday, when Chicago Police Superintendent David O. Brown urged the agency to release “any and all video, including body-worn camera footage, of the incident.” That was followed by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) tweeting that it was “critically important” for the police accountability office to release the video involving Adam “as quickly as possible.”

“Because his family and the public will undoubtedly have many questions, we must release any relevant videos as soon as possible,” Lightfoot said. “Recognizing that these are the most complex cases that COPA investigates, transparency and speed are crucial.”

AD

Although COPA reversed course on its plans to release the video, some in the community remain skeptical of the police’s account that Adam was armed. At the news conference Friday, Weiss Ortiz, the Toledo family’s attorney, acknowledged that the allegation was surprising to the family, but she said they hoped the body-cam video can help shed light on the early-morning shooting.

AD

Toledo remembered Adam as a happy boy who loved animals and his siblings. In a GoFundMe page that she started to help cover her son’s funeral expenses, Toledo noted how much he enjoyed playing with his Legos and making other people laugh, saying he “brightened up the room when he would walk in.”

The mother also spoke of the dreams Adam had in life — including one she admits is painful in the days since his death.

“He wanted to be a cop when he grew up,” Adam’s mother told the Sun-Times. “And next thing you know, a cop took his life.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Ex-officer texted ‘We stormed the Capitol’ during Jan. 6 riot, feds say, and tipsters turned him in","Hardin, who served on the police force for nearly two decades before retiring in 2017, is charged with knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building, disorderly conduct, and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building.

In a hearing Friday via Zoom, a judge ordered Hardin to self-surrender in the District of Columbia by April 8. Prosecutors didn’t seek to have him detained while his case proceeds, but local media reported that he was ordered to give up his passport and firearms.

AD

AD

A federal public defender representing Hardin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.

More than a dozen current and former law enforcement officers have been arrested and charged in connection with the insurrection at the Capitol, where supporters of former president Donald Trump violently tried to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory in the November election. Five people died as a result of the riot, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, and many more were wounded.

The arrests have raised alarms about the presence of right-wing extremists among the rank-and-file of police departments around the country. Police leaders, long reluctant to scrutinize their own officers’ extremist ties, are now facing intense pressure to root out staff with links to white supremacist and armed far-right groups.

AD

AD

The FBI zeroed in on Hardin by following leads provided by two tipsters, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court.

The first came in the day after the riot on the bureau’s threat hotline. A person reporting to be a friend who used to work with Hardin’s wife told investigators that Hardin had called earlier that week to say he was headed to Washington to “fight for the United States,” according to the complaint. As the mob swarmed the Capitol the afternoon of Jan. 6, Hardin texted the tipster that they were inside, investigators said.

“We stormed the Capitol, I am in here now!” he wrote, according to court records. “I know you don’t like Trump, but He is the rightful President!”

AD

“We will return until we win!” he allegedly wrote in another message.

A few days later, the FBI said, investigators received another tip from someone saying they’d known Hardin for more than 20 years.

AD

The person turned over a picture of Hardin standing beside a bust of Abraham Lincoln in what appeared to be the Capitol Crypt and said Hardin had texted it to a relative, according to the complaint. In the image, a man identified by authorities as Hardin can be seen wearing a dark jacket and blue “TRUMP” beanie and posing next to the marble sculpture.

Location data from Google obtained through a search warrant also showed that a mobile device linked to Hardin was in the Capitol the afternoon of the riot, the complaint says.

AD

Additionally, investigators also said they identified Hardin in other photos and videos taken inside the building, including a clip that allegedly showed him walking through the Capitol Crypt with a cellphone in his hand.

When the FBI ran Hardin’s name through law enforcement databases, investigators said, he showed up as a former Salt Lake City police officer who lived in Kaysville, Utah. The phone number associated with the Google account tracked by investigators matched a number for Hardin in those databases, according to the complaint.

AD

A Salt Lake City police spokesperson confirmed Hardin had retired from the department as an officer in December 2017. Records show he was on the force for nearly 20 years and had served as a detective for part of that time.

AD

Hardin won an “officer of the year” award from the department in 2012 for solving a 25-year-old murder case, and received an accolade in 2014 while working on the property crimes team, according to police records.

But he faced disciplinary action and had a falling out with some of his colleagues in his final years on the force, news archives show.

In 2015, Hardin was placed on administrative leave and had his vehicle, badges and guns confiscated following a tense encounter with a female detective who was leasing a home from him in Kaysville, Utah, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The detective said Hardin had driven to the property that summer after being warned by a superior to stay away and nudged her with his car as she stood in the driveway, according to the Tribune.

Hardin denied that he had hit the detective and filed a lawsuit seeking $300,000 in damages from her and department leaders on allegations of defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and other claims, local media reported. The case was dismissed in 2017, around the same time Hardin retired.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Diane Rehm tackles ‘death with dignity’ again, this time in a new documentary","Diane, the celebrated NPR talk show host and John’s wife of 54 years, kept vigil for the next 10 days. Just after 2 a.m. on June 23, 2014 — a few hours before John died — she took out her iPad and typed the first sentences of a passionate argument for medical aid in dying.

“In most of America, lawmakers and the church are deciding this issue for other people,” she says. “People they’ve never met. People whose suffering they have no way of understanding.”

AD

In 2016, Diane retired from NPR station WAMU after working there for more than 30 years. Since then, she has championed what she and other advocates call “death with dignity.” On Wednesday, PBS will broadcast her new documentary, “When My Time Comes.”

AD

The one-hour program and a similarly titled book published last year describe the death of her husband, a former lawyer for the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and the perspectives of politicians, doctors and patients about the movement that has led to new laws in nine states and the District.

Diane remarried in 2017, at age 81, to retired Lutheran minister and therapist John Hagedorn. Since leaving WAMU, she has been producing a twice-weekly podcast and a monthly book club. She spoke to The Washington Post in an hour-long telephone conversation that has been edited for length and clarity.

AD

Q: Why did your husband want to die?

A: It wasn’t so much that he was in pain. He said he had lost his sense of dignity. He was a very proud man, and he felt that if he continued to live he was going to lose even more dignity. He still had his sharp mind, and he knew exactly what he was doing and saying. Our daughter said, “Dad, we can keep you comfortable,” and he said, “Dammit, I don’t want comfort.”

AD

I’ve since learned that pain is number 6 on the list of reasons why people want medical aid in dying. The loss of joy in life is number one. The morning after John had that conversation with his doctor, I remember walking in to see him and saying: “Sweetheart, you look wonderful! Your face is rosy and your eyes are sparkling!” He said: “I have begun the journey.”

AD

Q: Do you worry that these laws allowing doctors to prescribe medications for the terminally ill so they can die peacefully could be a slippery slope toward making suicide more acceptable?

A: There’s a huge difference between medical aid in dying and assisted suicide. People who commit suicide want to die. In the film, I speak with a 37-year-old mother of two with breast cancer that had spread throughout her body. She said “If I had my druthers, I’d live until I’m 90. But I know I can’t, and I don’t want my 13-year-old son to see me suffer.” That’s the difference between medical aid in dying and suicide. One is a choice. The other is there is no choice; she knows she’s going to die and she wants to die peacefully and in a way that doesn’t leave her children with memories of her in agony.

AD

Q: What limits, if any, protect people who might be pressured to end their lives early?

AD

A: These laws are very specific, modeled on the first one, passed in Oregon in 1997. You must be within six months of death. You must be able to self-administer medication. You therefore cannot wait until your swallowing mechanism no longer operates and you also cannot wait until you can no longer say that you’re ready. In some states, you must be interviewed by a psychiatrist, alone, so that it’s clear that no one else is making this decision.

Q: What surprised you the most as you did your research?

A: What really shocks me is the fact that the Roman Catholic Church has been the most well-funded and outspoken opponent of medical aid in dying. A referendum in Massachusetts found some 70 percent of those polled said they were in favor. But then the church put $5 million into defeating that proposal.

AD

AD

Now, if your faith says to you, “I want God to decide when my life is going to end,” I’m in support of that. I’m an active Episcopalian myself.

If that’s what you want for yourself, I’m happy to support you along the way, and if you want everything medical aid can offer, then of course that’s what you should have. But I also believe that for people who’ve reached the end of a long, hard illness and are in their final six months before death, well, they should have a choice.

Q: What else do you think is preventing these laws from passing in more states?

A: Denial is a big problem. Talking about death is so taboo. You see me in the film standing in the church, asking how many people in the congregation plan not to die? Everybody is uncomfortable with the idea of death, so they don’t want to talk about it. But then what happens when your mother or father is dying and you haven’t spoken to them in advance? How are you to know what they want? Do they want to be hooked up to every possible machine at the end?

AD

AD

People also don’t know how and where the laws are changing. We now have medical aid in dying in Washington, D.C., but so many people do not know it. And 10 states are currently debating it, including New York and Connecticut. I am very hopeful this film will get more people talking about it. I also think covid has gotten people thinking more about how close death is for all of us.

As soon as the virus hit, I called my own physician and said I do not wish to go to a hospital if I come down with covid. I will not be put on a ventilator. She said “If that is your wish, I will make a note of it.” I switched doctors once we began making this film and I realized how few doctors are willing to help people who are ready to make up their minds.

Q: How did your bosses at NPR react to your outspokenness on such a controversial issue?

AD

AD

A: In 2016, there was a story about my advocacy in The Washington Post. I was planning then to do several dinners for Compassion & Choices, [ a U.S. nonprofit group working to improve patients’ rights]. NPR called and took me to task. Then 10 of the top executives at NPR came to WAMU and we sat in the conference room with my manager, and he was so worried I was going to stand up and say I quit if they told me I couldn’t do those dinners. I told them I was sorry but I wasn’t backing down. I wasn’t being paid to speak, but it was very important to me. Eventually they compromised and said do the three dinners you committed to do but if you speak out on this again on the air you will have to say you’re an advocate for medical aid in dying.

Q: Was this tension a factor in your decision to retire?

A: Absolutely not. Not at all. I was going to be 80 and I honestly feel that when those of us who’ve had such long and wonderful careers reach a certain point it’s no longer fair to just keep going because we have a big audience and people want us to keep going. There are young, talented people who ought to have a right to move into those chairs.

AD

AD

Q: Your documentary shows you with a young man videotaping you expressing your wishes for how you want to die. What are you telling him?

A: That’s my grandson Benjamin. He was 19 at the time. I’m telling him that should I somehow become an individual who experiences Alzheimer’s, I need you to tell me early on that you are seeing this. If that does happen, I will begin making my plans to end my life before I am no longer able to do so. Obviously, this is not allowed under any current Medical Aid in Dying laws around the country, so I will have to plan to take matters into my own hands.",2021-04-01 00:00:00

"Debate over racism, building names intensifies at University of Richmond as top trustee comes under scrutiny","Queally, as rector of the 3,900-student university, leads the board of trustees and has emerged as a staunch defender of leaving the surnames of the Rev. Robert Ryland and Douglas Southall Freeman on prominent campus buildings. Ryland, the school’s founding president in the mid-19th century, was an enslaver, and Freeman, a trustee and rector in the early 20th century, supported racial segregation and eugenics.

On March 26, Queally came to campus to meet with faculty, staff and student representatives who want to remove the names. Many in the campus community have said it is wrong to honor figures from the school’s past strongly associated with white supremacy.

AD

AD

Afterward, seven faculty leaders who were there wrote an account of the meeting that sharply criticized Queally. They wrote that the rector said he considered the issue of building names a “closed matter” but that he wanted “to help Black, Brown and ‘regular students.’ ”

They also wrote that Queally characterized the effort to change the names as “cancel culture” and that he believed the university would be failing in its duty to prepare students for the “real world” if it did remove the names.

At another point, they wrote, Queally “interrupted a Black woman staff member in the middle of her initial comments and noted that she sounded angry. He then proceeded to direct a series of comments and questions at this staff member over much of the remaining hour in a largely adversarial manner.”

AD

The faculty leaders who wrote the account were Karen Kochel, Stephen Long, Cassandra Marshall, Noah Sachs, Andrew Schoeneman, Peter Smallwood and Thad Williamson. They are all professors on the faculty senate.

AD

Asked about the faculty account, Queally sent a one-paragraph written statement through a university spokeswoman. He did not dispute specific quotes the faculty attributed to him.

“Our conversation with a small number of faculty and staff leaders on Friday was intended to be candid, personal, and open,” Queally said in the statement. “Those present spoke with honesty, passion, and conviction. The evidence of our commitment to equity and inclusion on our campus is abundant, and our support for all students is unwavering.”

AD

Queally, through the spokeswoman, declined an interview request.

Queally, according to a university website, is from Palm Beach, Fla., and earned a bachelor’s degree from Richmond in 1986. He is also the father of three Richmond graduates. He is a significant donor to the university, and his name appears on three campus structures: the Queally Center for Admission and Career Services, Queally Hall and Queally Athletics Center.

AD

Jessica Washington, who is assistant director of student engagement and the Bonner Scholars Program for the university, stepped forward Friday to identify herself as the Black staff member whom Queally had addressed in the meeting. She corroborated the faculty account, in a telephone interview with The Washington Post. “I felt attacked, I felt bullied, I felt dehumanized,” she said of her exchange with Queally.

AD

Kayla Corbin, 21, a senior from Queens, N.Y., belongs to a group called the Black Student Coalition that has sought removal of the Ryland and Freeman names. She and others from the coalition met with Queally after the rector met with faculty and staff. That meeting also was contentious, according to Corbin.

Corbin said she was troubled by Queally’s demeanor as he addressed the students. “He kept being very dismissive,” she said. “Not at all what someone would expect from a rector.” She said that when she read the faculty account of Queally’s reference to Black, Brown and “regular students,” it struck a chord with her. “Exactly how he acted in our meeting,” Corbin said. “As if we were not ‘regular students.’ As if we were asking too much.”

AD

Ronald A. Crutcher, the university president, issued a statement to the campus community Friday afternoon. Crutcher, who is retiring in the summer, is the university’s first African American president. He has voiced support for the trustees’ decision to keep the Ryland name on an academic building and the Freeman name on a dormitory. But he expressed regret over what happened at the March 26 meetings.

AD

“We understand the hurt, dismay, and anger, and we are resolved to forging a path forward that demonstrates our collective commitment to UR’s shared values of equity, inclusivity, diversity, and ethical engagement,” Crutcher wrote.

“Those values have not been on display recently, including during the meetings held last week with faculty, staff, and students. The experience of those in attendance, especially one of our staff colleagues,” he continued, “was inconsistent with our stated values and expectations for our community. For that, I am truly sorry.”

AD

Also on Friday, professors said, the faculty senate approved a motion to censure Queally for “his decisions regarding the renaming of Ryland and Freeman Halls, his disrespectful treatment of university employees, and his reference to White students as ‘regular students.’ ”

AD

Queally had no immediate reply Friday evening to an email seeking comment on the censure motion and Crutcher’s statement.

In recent years, responding to mass movements for racial justice, colleges and universities around the country have been reckoning with their past and unearthing painful new information. Johns Hopkins University, for example, disclosed this year that its namesake benefactor had been an enslaver. Hopkins leaders do not support renaming the university.

But elsewhere, many schools have renamed buildings and removed plaques and memorials seen as honoring figures who promoted white supremacy. Richmond’s approach is different. Its leaders have sought to keep the Ryland and Freeman names but add context to them, saying that is the best way to tell the full and often painful history of the university.

AD

But many faculty and students are adamantly opposed to that approach and are protesting in various ways, severing extracurricular connections to university activities through a step they call “disaffiliation.”",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Derek Chauvin trial: Whose fear matters?,"McMillian did what he could but he couldn’t do enough, he explained. It was a terrifying situation. And that’s what the first week of the Chauvin trial came down to, again and again: who gets to be scared in America.

Others standing with McMillian on Chicago Avenue that evening were also scared, they said in their eyewitness recollections. They begged Chauvin to stop crushing Floyd, pointing out that Floyd was no longer moving. They did this all from the sidewalk where they had been instructed to remain: Mostly Black or Brown Americans, they were terrified of disobeying police orders even as they watched a man’s life be extinguished under a policeman’s knee.

The witnesses, who were not shown on video because they were minors at the time of George Floyd's death, described the scene they witnessed. (The Washington Post)

A 17-year-old high school student testified that she was scared. A 33-year-old private security officer testified that he was scared. Darnella Frazier, noting that Chauvin’s defense attorney had portrayed the neighborhood as high in crime, testified that she’d felt safe while walking to the store; she’d only felt scared when law enforcement arrived. Two officers put their hands on their Mace canisters, she said, and she thought they might spray her.

AD

AD

Christopher Martin, the teenage Cup Foods cashier, testified that he’d originally recorded Floyd’s death but deleted the video; he was scared what could happen to him if he was questioned or got more involved. He’d already feared for his mother’s safety; that’s why he’d phoned their nearby apartment to tell her not to come downstairs. He’d already feared for his livelihood; that’s why he’d questioned what to do about the alleged counterfeit $20 bill Floyd had used to purchase cigarettes. He knew that if he accepted it, the money would come out of his own meager wages.

His fear was immediate and it was long-ranging; it was specific and it was existential. In the course of his young life, the concept of being scared was already fully earned.

Chauvin’s defense team began revealing its strategy: to present Chauvin as the one who had the right to be scared. The former officer’s lawyer attempted to paint the witnesses as an unruly mob whose heckling had unnerved and distracted Chauvin to the point that he was unable to do his job.

AD

AD

“It’s fair to say you grew angrier and angrier?” defense lawyer Eric Nelson asked witness Donald Williams. (“I grew professional and professional,” Williams said).

“But as time went on and more people showed up, voices became louder,” Nelson said to Frazier. (“As we understood more what was happening,” she replied).

“Would you describe other people’s demeanors as upset or angry?” Nelson asked firefighter Genevieve Hansen, who was in the crowd.

“I don’t know if you’ve seen anybody be killed,” Hansen shot back, “But it’s upsetting.”

She later said that even after Floyd’s body was removed, she was afraid to leave: “I was still worried about the witnesses on scene,” she said. “Particularly because they were people of color, Black men, and I was worried about their safety, and there were officers still on scene.”

Judge Peter Cahill reprimanded Genevieve Hansen, a witness, when her exchanges with Derek Chauvin’s lawyer grew tense at the end of an emotional day. (The Washington Post)

The crowd was yelling at Chauvin, yes, but they were yelling about something specific and alarming: the knee. Chauvin was in the unique position to stop the yelling any time he wanted by moving his knee from Floyd’s neck.

AD

AD

And yet the defense’s narrative relied on the concept that the police officer was the scared one — and rightly so. That’s why his knee remained on Floyd’s neck, Chauvin’s lawyers would have us believe, even after Floyd was subdued and handcuffed. Even after his fellow officer told Chauvin, “I think he’s passing out.” Even after a third officer checked for a pulse and said, “I can’t find one.”

He had three colleagues, all of whom also had guns, and yet he was still scared. He had a badge, the authority of the law, the ability to radio for backup, and a vehicle exempt from speed limits, and he was still scared. He had George Floyd already subdued and handcuffed. If Derek Chauvin was scared, then, my God, what would have made him feel safe?

The trial of Derek Chauvin is shaping up to be about the power dynamics that have haunted America for 400 years — the dynamics of race, gender and class.

AD

AD

The general contours of the defense’s early explanations for Chauvin’s actions — that the armed officer of the state was, in fact, the vulnerable one — reminded me of scenarios we’ve seen play out repeatedly in the past several years: the men claiming that #MeToo (or “cancel culture”) had gone too far — that men were now a persecuted class. In fact, in the majority of cases, women were announcing that they were tired of being afraid, that they would no longer stand for the status quo.

Or the strains of Christianity claiming that their way of life is under attack — that it has become dangerous to be Christian in America (and will remain so unless we pass a federal abortion ban and deny transgender people medical care, and even then . . . ).

Or the mostly White men who were so certain that their candidate was being screwed over that they invaded the U.S. Capitol, and brandished weapons, and a policeman died. (And that, by the way, was the kind of angry crowd that should rightly scare law enforcement.)

AD

AD

The right to be scared has historically been reserved for the privileged. As the saying goes: When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.

When you’re accustomed to power, then you might believe that being yelled at by a rightfully upset crowd is the same thing as being targeted by an angry mob.

But, in the first week of the trial, witness after witness explained why their fear that day was justified, correct and appropriate. And that it paled in comparison to the fear of George Floyd.

The man was lying in the street, his face mashed into the pavement. He was calling out for his own life. He was screaming for his mother.

Did that scare Derek Chauvin? Somebody should ask.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"He said he spent $15,000 on a Disney World trip. He refused a temperature check and got arrested.","Kelly Sills paid a small fortune for an enchanting trip to “the most magical place on Earth.”

Instead, the Baton Rouge resident — like several other Disney World guests who have defied coronavirus restrictions — visited the Orange County jail.

Amid heightened precautions for the virus at the major Florida tourist attraction, Sills, 47, skipped the temperature screening required of guests, authorities said. He was confronted by security about it at a Disney Springs restaurant, the Boathouse, when he yelled and refused to leave, according to an Orange County Sheriff’s Office arrest report from Feb. 13. When deputies insisted he would be charged with trespassing, he pointed to how much he spent on his vacation, according to body-camera footage released this week.

“I paid $15,000,” said Sills, handcuffed. “You can’t trespass me if I paid $15,000.”

He pleaded not guilty to a trespassing charge, according to Orange County court records.

In an interview Saturday with The Washington Post, Sills said he would have “happily” consented to a temperature screening but he had inadvertently walked in through an exit and not realized his error. He partly blamed the security manager for escalating the conflict — and compared Disney security to Nazis and the mafia — but also admitted he was in “a bit of a mood” after a day of travel.

He was arrested on the first night of what was a five-day trip with his family, a rare reprieve for which he had paid thousands, he said. Two hotel rooms, air travel and admission to Disney and Universal for seven to eight people set him back, he said.

“Covid is a very serious thing, but so is my vacation with my family,” he said.

Sills’s arrest, first reported by the Orlando Sentinel, is not the first instance guests have been reprimanded over defying coronavirus restrictions at a Disney park. The newspaper reported several skirmishes have stemmed from angry refusals to follow the theme park’s rules, including guests spitting on, yelling at and pushing employees tasked with reminding visitors to follow restrictions instated to curb the spread of the deadly virus.

[Unmasked spring breakers are descending on Florida. Officials are begging them to behave.]

The confrontations at Disney World come as other parts of Florida have had to ramp up enforcement when rowdy tourists flocked to the state that Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has promoted as less restrictive. While spring break revelers descended on South Florida, DeSantis praised how busy the area was compared with cities in other states with stricter coronavirus guidelines, such as New York City. He has touted the state’s distribution of vaccine doses and argued it is safe to visit.

“It’s booming here because you can live like a human being,” he said at a February press event. “People take precautions, which is great, but you’re not locked down. People aren’t miserable.”

But some local leaders said the “open for business” message that endorses fewer rules could lead to “chaos.”

Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger said conflicts over coronavirus rules are uncommon, with most guests following the requirements shared with them before they travel. Disney requires guests to stay home if they have symptoms, wear masks for if they are ages 2 and up, and undergo temperature checks at some entries.

“Guests have been overwhelmingly supportive of our protocols,” she wrote in a statement. “Millions of Guests visit our theme parks each year and in rare instances when things of this nature occur, we hold them accountable.”

In the body-camera footage, Sills expressed disbelief that Disney was requiring a temperature check as deputies walked him to a patrol car.

“I’m so ready to be done with this covid,” he told deputies at another point.

As deputies escorted Sills past families and others strolling through the park, he had a change of heart, wanting to undergo a temperature screening.

“They’ll do that at the jail,” a deputy responded.

“Well, that’s good,” Sills said.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Get ready for travel prices to surge, experts say","Long-grounded travelers are revving their engines.

With Friday’s guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that fully vaccinated people can travel again at low risk to themselves, millions of Americans got the green light to start planning their next trips.

And while CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a news briefing Friday that the agency is still not recommending travel due to the rising number of coronavirus cases, travel numbers are already up steeply in recent weeks — an upward trend expected to accelerate before the announcement even came.

The Transportation Security Administration has screened more than 1 million passengers every day for the past few weeks and is hiring thousands of new agents to get ready for the impending boom. Travel booking app Hopper has seen a 58 percent increase in searches for domestic summer travel. Airlines are adding scores of new routes to leisure destinations to meet shifting travel demand.

So what impact will the CDC’s updated guidance have on the industry? According to travel experts, we’re likely to see a bump in prices as customers start booking trips again.

As demand spikes, supply will struggle to keep up, causing travel to become more expensive. Many hotels, bars, tours and attractions are still operating at reduced capacity; rental car agencies downsized their fleet to cut costs; and more people are clamoring for all of the above.

We spoke to six travel insiders on what happens next and why.

‘I think there’s going to be a short-term bump in airfare for the summer’

Scott Keyes, founder of Scott’s Cheap Flights, says the pent-up demand for travel is unlike anything the industry has ever seen. The news from the CDC could impact flight prices as more people start pursuing travel plans.

“I think there’s going to be a short-term bump in airfare for the summer,” Keyes says. “Everybody is looking to travel, looking to make up for lost time, and especially looking to do so this summer while the weather’s nice and going finally safe and [everyone’s] comfortable to do so.”

Keyes doesn’t expect the bump in fare price to last more than the summer.

“There’s a lot of reasons why I think airfare’s going to continue to stay very, very affordable,” he says. “The golden age of cheap travel, like that we’ve been living in since 2015, is going to continue coming out of the pandemic.”

‘People shouldn’t let down all of their guard’

Lin Chen, director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, said enough is unknown about the coronavirus — especially as new variants emerge — that travelers still need to be cautious.

“I think people shouldn’t let down all of their guard,” she said.

She added: “I think for the general public, even if they’re fully vaccinated and traveling, they should continue to take all the other precautions like wearing masks and avoiding crowds and washing hands well and physical distancing from unknown people.”

Chen, who is president of the International Society of Travel Medicine, said vaccinated travelers should still look for destinations that have good health-care structures in place and are vaccinating their own populations at a steady pace.

The CDC said that fully vaccinated people don’t need a coronavirus test before or after traveling domestically and don’t need to self-quarantine after trips within the United States. Before international travel, the agency said, tests are only needed if a destination requires them. However, even fully vaccinated people must test negative no more than three days before coming back to the United States and should get tested within three to five days after arriving home.

“I think domestic travel is probably the safest still, or the easiest and least cumbersome,” Chen said.

‘Hotels are operating — in some areas — on reduced capacity. So they’re going to fill up that much faster.’

Misty Belles, managing director for global public relations for travel agency Virtuoso, says travel demand has been rising exponentially since Americans were promised they’d be getting vaccinations soon. The CDC announcement has added fuel to that fire and will give people confidence to book travel. She predicts prices will change according to the new demand.

“You still have some limited availability issues because hotels are operating — in some areas — on reduced capacity. So they’re going to fill up that much faster,” she says.

In places where she’s seen an uptick in travel already, such as Florida, Belles says rates are already higher than they would normally be.

“That’s going to continue to climb,” she says. “And it’s going to be the same for airfares as well.”

The new guidelines lead to new effort

Mark Crossey, a U.S. travel expert at booking site Skyscanner, says many vacationers have been waiting for this announcement to finally book a meaningful trip, although doing so will come with some extra effort.

“The potential easing of restrictions by the summer and a successful start to the vaccine rollout, combined with this new announcement has boosted positivity,” Crossey said in an email. “But these are just some pieces of the puzzle with clear guidance relating to travel restrictions, quarantine measures, digital health passes and testing needed to enable travelers to know what is safe to book and within the guidelines.”

Crossey says travel for Americans in 2020 was dominated by mostly domestic trips, plus visits to Mexico and the Caribbean. Now that the vaccine progress could help open borders, he expects there to be a higher percentage of international trips.

‘Make sure that you can do the things you want’

While more people will be traveling — and paying high prices for hotels, airfare and rental cars — the summer travel season still won’t be normal, said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group.

There may be available flights and hotel rooms, and vaccinated people might have reassurance that they’re safe, but some rules such as capacity limits at theme parks, sporting events, museums or other attractions are likely to stay in place.

“Before you book your flights and hotels, make sure that you can do the things you want — and if it includes going to a baseball game or theme park, do your research first about availability and ticket prices and everything else before you start purchasing,” he said. “You don’t want to be stuck spending a lot of money only to find that something isn’t available or is going to be far more expensive than you thought.”

He said that because some popular travel options such as cruises and visiting Europe are still restricted, more travelers are likely to flood the places that are open to Americans — which means people could find themselves among crowds once again.

A new comfort level for old travel habits

Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy at the U.S. Travel Association, said travel sentiment still suggests people want to spend time outdoors at beaches, national parks and mountain sites. But with the new guidance from the CDC, she said she expects other types of destinations to gain popularity.

“I think those that have been more cautious about traveling by plane or staying in a hotel or going to a city will start to feel more comfortable once they’ve been vaccinated,” she said.

She said some big questions still remain for the CDC to tackle, including reopening international travel and allowing larger gatherings so business meetings and events can resume.

“From an industry perspective, those are two very important segments of our business,” she said.

"With new immigration role, Harris gets a politically perilous assignment","For Harris, the past three months have been a series of firsts: The first woman to become vice president is also the first Indian American and first Black person to hold that title. Now, she is tackling her first big challenge, taking on a complex problem that has vexed Republican and Democratic administrations for decades.

AD

At the same time, White House officials have struggled to define Harris’s directive. They have recently emphasized that her focus is on the Northern Triangle countries of Central America and the underlying causes of migration, not the more politically sensitive question of what to do with people once they arrive.

Many Democrats say this is a perilous mission for Harris, who is widely seen as a potential successor to Biden and the de facto leader of the party’s next generation. They worry it will collide with her long-term ambitions and say that, for better or for worse, she could own much of what happens on the border in coming months.

“There’s no question this one is high-risk, high-reward,” said former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro. “I’m betting she’s more than able to get the job done.”

Harris is already dealing with competing demands. Liberal leaders and immigration activists are warning against embracing policies that are too harsh, while Republican critics are ramping up efforts to portray her and other Democrats as soft and incompetent on the border.

More than 171,000 migrants were taken into custody along the southern border in March, the highest monthly total since 2006, according to preliminary data reviewed by The Washington Post.

The new assignment for Harris — a daughter of immigrants — has been the subject of private fascination by her allies, who have traded sometimes pessimistic texts with one another about where it will lead and what it will mean for her political future, according to people with knowledge of the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the exchanges.

But Harris’s friends say that she is looking for opportunities to show presidential leadership and strong support for Biden as she eyes her own future — and that her new portfolio allows her to do both. “The important thing to Kamala Harris right now is her relationship with the president of the United States. She will tell you that,” said Democratic strategist Bakari Sellers, a close Harris associate.

She has openly promoted her new role this week. On Monday, she posted a photo on Instagram of a meeting she held with administration officials who had traveled to the region. Two days later, at a roundtable discussion about coronavirus vaccines with religious leaders, Harris excused her tardiness, explaining that she had just come from a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Harris said her chief aim is to figure out why people are fleeing their countries for the United States.

“We all know most people like being at home. They like being where they grew up,” Harris said. “. . . So we have to ask, ‘Why do people leave that?’ And usually they leave because there is a lack of opportunity or it is just not safe. And so my area of focus on the Northern Triangle is to deal with some of those issues.”

AD

AD

However, it is not clear the public will take such a nuanced view of her directive, Democrats say. White House officials this week have tried to stress that Harris will not be working on strategies for processing the thousands of unaccompanied children at the border.

“The vice president’s role is really focused on the Northern Triangle,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday, referring to the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

The sharp increase in the numbers of migrants trekking to the border can be explained by a variety of factors, according to interviews with migrants, lawmakers on the border and experts. These include dire economic conditions in Latin America, violence and oppression, natural disasters and the pandemic, as well as Biden’s welcoming rhetoric.

AD

The administration has recently adopted a sterner tone, warning would-be migrants not to come as officials struggle to keep up with the growing numbers of people showing up. When Biden announced Harris’s assignment on March 24, he said she would “lead our efforts” with countries that “are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.”

Harris spoke with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei this week, and she is expected to have more conversations with leaders in the region. Officials said she will travel to the region, though they have not yet announced a date or location for her first trip.

AD

Biden called her the “most qualified” person for the job and cited her experience as California’s attorney general and her résumé fighting organized crime. Although Harris has experience on border issues dating to her time as attorney general, she is not seen by colleagues as an expert on Latin American geopolitics.

AD

“The specific area is new to her,” said Ricardo Zúñiga, the State Department’s special envoy for the Northern Triangle, adding that there are a lot of nuances to the issue. “She’s very conscious of that.”

Harris’s new assignment has come with a steep learning curve. Officials at the National Security Council and the State Department said they have been briefing her in the Situation Room on Mexico and regional issues. They have presented daily memos to her and held lengthy meetings, including one session last week that went 90 minutes, according to Juan Gonzalez, the NSC’s senior director for the Western Hemisphere.

Gonzalez said Harris has responded with questions, recommendations and requests for materials to read on weekends and has been soliciting advice from members of Congress. She has spoken frequently about the need to involve the private sector in efforts to improve living conditions in the region, he said, and has taken a prosecutorial approach in pressing advisers on their plans.

AD

AD

“She challenged us. She asked us: ‘How do you define corruption?’ ” he recalled of a recent conversation. “ ‘Are you talking about government corruption? Are you talking about private-sector corruption? Are you talking about institutions?’ ”

Some outside allies warn that seeking to correct deeply rooted problems that have spurred people to take risky trips to the United States is not likely to lead to results in the near future.

“I think their goal is trying to foster changes and improvements in those countries. The difficulty with that goal is Rome wasn’t built in a day and you have a border crisis right now,” said Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney who was a Justice Department official in the Obama administration. “By the time you would succeed in any of those things, it would not be in any time frame to deal with what we are seeing right now.”

AD

AD

Biden also tasked Harris with spurring Latin American countries to tighten migration enforcement at their borders. “She’s asked a lot of questions about the migration-management component of this,” Zúñiga said.

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.), who has been critical of the Biden administration’s response to the border surge, said that he was excited to see Harris in the new role and that it reminded him of a similar assignment President Barack Obama gave to Biden when he was vice president.

“Bottom line: We can play defense on the 1-yard line, called the U.S.-Mexico border, or we can play defense on the 20-yard line,” Cuellar said.

Like many Democrats, Cuellar said Harris — who also has been tasked with helping to sell Biden’s coronavirus relief plan and working to overcome vaccine hesitancy — is putting her political future on the line in assuming such a weighty job.

AD

AD

“Is there a political risk? Absolutely,” Cuellar said. “She’s got to deal with the people on the progressive [side]. She’s got to deal with people on the right.”

Recent history shows the difficulty of navigating these pressures. Many immigration activists still refer to Obama as the “deporter in chief” because of his aggressive deportation policies. The anger was still fresh in the 2020 campaign, prompting Biden to make a rare break from Obama, saying his policies were a mistake.

Republicans have been quick to pounce on Biden’s announcement of Harris’s assignment, pointing to liberal positions she has taken on immigration in the past and seeking to use the decision to attack Democratic candidates ahead of the midterm elections.

“Now that President Biden has named you Border Czar in charge of the administration's response, I want to express to you the threats and challenges caused by this administration’s open border policies,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) wrote in a letter to Harris this week.

Sellers said that Harris allies who worry about the political fallout are underestimating her abilities. But the magnitude of the challenge she faces will be unlike anything she has tackled before, he added.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"Democrats would struggle to pass votings rights, immigration overhaul even without filibuster","That’s because, if the anti-filibuster advocates succeed abolishing that procedural hurdle, they would need all 50 members of Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer’s caucus to support legislation and then have Vice President Harris break the tie in their favor.

AD

And Manchin, along with quite a few other Democrats, has deep reservations about the most ambitious pieces of that agenda.

AD

He has already declared he is not going to support a voting rights bill that House and Senate Democrats have otherwise declared their highest priority, and he has expressed opposition to the House-passed legislation to increase background checks on gun purchases.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, recently declared that President Biden’s comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws lacked sufficient Democratic support to pass the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) can afford just three defections from her ranks to pass an all-Democratic bill.

AD

The effort to create a $15 minimum wage fell on its face when just 42 Senate Democrats voted for the proposal during an amendment vote last month.

That’s the same number of co-sponsors Democrats have for legislation that would grant statehood to the District of Columbia, a move that would very likely lead to two Democrats getting elected to the Senate. Support for expanding the Supreme Court, a liberal dream following President Donald Trump’s success in confirming three justices to secure a conservative majority, lags far behind D.C. statehood’s level of support.

AD

And Medicare-for-all, the single-payer health insurance proposal, had just 15 co-sponsors in the Senate last year.

AD

Simply put, in the words of some advisers to Senate Democrats, counting to 50 is hard. And even if they do move to a simple majority, Democrats might end up advancing important-but-incremental proposals that are not the grand ideas that dominated the presidential primary debates last year.

This reality has created a split screen for the Democrats, where inside the Capitol there is lingering doubt about ending the filibuster because no one is certain what will actually pass if a simple majority rules the day.

Yet beyond Capitol Hill, the vast array of party apparatus is moving forward with the expectation that Schumer (D-N.Y.) will be able to round up 50 votes to blow up the filibuster on a party-line vote, with Harris breaking the tie. People from large donors to former president Barack Obama, along with powerful unions and civil rights leaders, support the move.

AD

AD

Even Biden, a 36-year veteran of the Senate, has opened the door to some changes in filibuster rules.

“It is every element of the Democratic coalition,” said Adam Jentleson, former deputy chief of staff to former Senate Democratic leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.).

Jentleson, who wrote “Kill Switch,” a book about the filibuster as a “crippling” force, described Democratic senators as a “lagging indicator” of where the party is heading and predicted that eventually they will fold amid intense pressure from their own supporters.

“All the incentives are pulling in the same direction,” he said.

This creates a few strategic questions that are percolating through the minds of top Democratic aides and some senators: What legislation will actually become law if they blow up this Senate tradition? What proposal is worth the move? And will Democrats further disappoint their own supporters if they still can’t approve their most muscular liberal agenda on a simple majority?

AD

AD

The two most likely bills to get approved in a simple-majority Senate are the Dream Act, which would grant permanent status to millions of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is named after the late Georgia congressman and would update the landmark 1965 civil rights law.

Every member of Schumer’s caucus co-sponsored the voting act last year, including Manchin, so it would almost certainly have enough support to pass on a simple majority. And Durbin has already said that he has every Democrat supporting the Dream Act and is close to securing 10 GOP votes needed to clear a filibuster under current rules.

“I’ve been stopped by the filibuster five times from passing it. I had a majority; I didn’t have 60 votes. Do I have 60 now? I think I’m close,” Durbin, who is the majority whip, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” last month.

AD

AD

Liberals believe they would probably have a united Democratic front to add judgeships to the lower federal courts around the nation, if they just need 50 votes from Schumer’s caucus. Even Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has supported this in the past.

But these narrower proposals do not animate the left.

Most immigration advocates want a comprehensive bill that will deal with all undocumented immigrants, not just those brought here as children, and Democrats have rallied behind the For the People Act, with its expansive proposals mandating early voting and mail-in ballots along with creating nonpartisan commissions to draw congressional district lines.

AD

And they want to expand the Supreme Court, not lower courts.

How would Biden’s supporters react if Democrats took the bold action of eliminating the “Jim Crow relic,” as Obama labeled the filibuster, and still only passed compromise measures within their own ranks?

AD

When Manchin suggested removing some portions of the For the People Act, activists lashed out. “There is absolutely no reason for supporters of S. 1 to negotiate with ourselves and dramatically narrow the reforms in the bill,” wrote Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21.

Even with the filibuster still alive, Democrats have moved quickly to advance a sweeping portion of Biden’s agenda. First was a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill, and next up is a jobs package that could total $4 trillion in the fall.

AD

The first bill used budget procedure rules that allowed a simple majority to push it through the Senate, something Democrats are almost certain to try again for the second package.

Jentleson sees these budgetary bills as the gateway drugs to procuring the final votes of support to end the legislative filibuster, from Manchin and roughly 10 others who have expressed hesitation.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Biden administration political appointees: Who is filling key roles,"About this story

The tracker is maintained by The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan good-governance organization. Researchers at the Partnership for Public Service follow presidential and congressional actions on approximately 800 top executive branch positions, a portion of the roughly 1,200 positions that require Senate confirmation.

What positions are included and not included?

The tracker includes all full-time, civilian positions in the executive branch that require Senate confirmation except for judges, marshals and U.S. attorneys. Military appointments and part-time positions requiring Senate confirmation are not included.

Biden may opt to keep some officials appointed by previous administrations in place. Researchers are working to determine which officials, if any, will be held over.

The tracker does not show officials serving in an acting capacity, so positions unfilled by Biden are not necessarily vacant. All presidents appoint some temporary officials to Senate-confirmed positions to preserve continuity during transitions between one confirmed official and another. While acting officials for high-profile positions are often widely reported, temporary officials for lesser known positions are often not reported publicly — or are done so inconsistently.

For now, the tracker includes official announcements by the Biden transition team and any picks reported by The Washington Post.

How often is the tracker updated?

Before Biden’s inauguration, the page will update roughly once a day in the morning with the latest announcements from Biden’s transition team. During the first few months of the Biden administration, the tracker will be updated at least twice a day as more positions are considered and filled.

How does the nomination process work?

Presidents formally nominate individuals to the Senate to fill each position, a responsibility established in the Constitution. The Senate refers most nominations to a specific committee with jurisdiction over the position. Committees scrutinize the nominees and hold hearings to discuss their views, qualifications and histories. After the hearing, committees usually take a vote on whether to report out the nomination favorably, unfavorably or without recommendation. Or they can vote to take no action on the nomination.

A nomination generally goes to the full Senate for a final vote if a majority of the committee votes favorably, but this isn’t required to get a final vote. Many nominations are approved through a unanimous consent agreement that limits debate and speeds up the process. For nominees subject to a vote, a simple majority is necessary to win confirmation. The Senate has rules that allow for individual senators to voice concerns about the nomination process.

Most nominations that go to the Senate are ultimately successful. However, some do not receive a Senate vote, either because their nominations are withdrawn by the president, or because the Senate calendar year ends before a vote takes place. By law, nominations not confirmed by the end of the year are automatically withdrawn, and the president must resubmit them to be considered again the following congressional session.

Where does the information recorded in the appointee tracker come from?

Most of the information regarding nominations and the Senate’s process comes from Congress.gov, the official website for U.S. federal legislative information. Information about Senate-confirmed positions generally comes from the “United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions,” known as the Plum Book, published by Congress every four years. However, each administration may add new positions and organizations, or change position titles. The tracker reflects those changes when they are made public.

Information on resignations and informal appointee announcements comes from publicly available sources such as news stories and government websites. The government does not publish any single, up-to-date source of information on the status of these positions. In some cases, public information on the status of certain officials or positions is inconsistent or nonexistent. The information provided in this tracker is based on the best publicly available details.

Is it possible that the tracker is missing a nominee or update?

There’s a slight chance. The Partnership for Public Service and The Post have staff members and processes devoted to following nomination and confirmation developments. However, the federal government does not have a uniform method of reporting appointee employment statuses, and occasionally, a change will occur with little or no media coverage. It is possible changes will occur that are not yet identified in the tracker, especially for lower-profile positions. If you think something is missing that should be included, please contact tracker@ourpublicservice.org.

"Fearful of political criticism, China won’t show the Oscars live","The Beijing-backed Hong Kong broadcaster TVB said this week it will not air the April 25 Academy Awards telecast in the city, marking the first time in more than 50 years it will fail to do so. It follows Chinese media regulators’ decision earlier in March not to air the Oscars live on its streaming platforms. A censored version is likely to air later.

AD

AD

The reason appears to be “Do Not Split,” a 35-minute film made at the front lines of the 2019 Hong Kong democracy protests that has been nominated in the documentary short category. Directed by Norwegian filmmaker Anders Hammer and focusing on such protesters as Joey Siu, a North Carolina-born and Hong Kong-raised activist, the film covers the siege of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and other key moments during the protests, providing an immediacy-filled look at the crackdown.

The movie appears to have Chinese regulators worried about new attention on the protests, which led to sweeping arrests and resulted in the passing of an infamous “national security law” restricting free speech in the city. The Communist Party is highly sensitive to discussion of its handling of the protests and fearful of provoking any future ones.

Additionally, the government may be concerned about a platform for filmmaker Chloe Zhao, whose “Nomadland” is a front-runner for best picture and director. While the Frances McDormand-starring movie focuses on itinerant workers in the modern American West, it comes from a Chinese-born director who once made comments critical of China.

Hollywood decidedly needs China, which is a huge moviegoing market. In 2019, the last covid-free movie year, its $9.2 billion in box office was second only to the U.S., which rang up $11.4 billion in ticket sales.

Yet Chinese citizens’ interest in Hollywood product has been sinking as local-language product has risen. In 2019 only seven of the top 20 box-office movies in China came from Hollywood studios, down from 12 just two years earlier. Attempts to specifically appeal to the market with “Mulan” failed.

In a joint Zoom interview with Siu on Friday, Hammer said that he was perplexed but not entirely saddened by Beijing’s Oscar move.

“We think this brings more attention to the documentary,” he said. “I find it hard to explain their logic. Because it definitely helps us.”

AD

Hammer noted the irony: A cri de coeur for free speech was now the reason a global telecast would be censored. “It’s just a continuation of what we see in our movie.”

AD

Siu said Beijing’s action “doesn’t seem very shocking or surprising” but she was disheartened by what it meant for artists at the Oscars. “It’s a very sad situation. All these talented directors who are outside China may not be seen,” she said.

A spokesman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which oversees the Oscars, did not reply to a request for comment.

In the past, the Oscars have been aired live in the morning in Beijing on M1905, a state-run video site. It is not clear how and in what form it will be shown now. It remains unlikely the ceremony will be shown in Hong Kong at all.

AD

Reports from Bloomberg News and Radio Free Asia said that the Communist Party had told all media outlets to play down the Oscars generally and the Zhao and “Do Not Split” awards in particular.

The moves come even as Derek Tsang’s Mandarin-language “Better Days,” an apolitical teen romance that was a huge hit on the mainland, has been nominated for best international feature as the official Hong Kong submission. Such an event would normally be a reason for China to celebrate: No film submitted by either Hong Kong or the mainland has won the foreign prize in its 65-year history.

AD

Hammer said he is not likely to be able to travel from Europe due to pandemic-related restrictions and hopes to connect remotely. Siu, who fled Hong Kong six months ago fearing for her safety, currently lives in D.C., where she says she faces online harassment from pro-Party users of social media. She still has hopes of traveling to Los Angeles for the ceremony. Hammer said if the film wins he planned on making Chinese-government crackdowns the focus of his speech.

AD

So far, the academy has not made requests from or put any pressure on the pair, Hammer and Siu said.

For the academy, this was supposed to be a time to celebrate a newfound globalism. Half of the group’s 819 new members this year hail from countries outside the United States. And it’s coming off a year in which “Parasite,” a Korean-language movie, became the first non-English language film to win the Oscar for best picture.

Yet the China news provides an example of how tricky such harmony can be in a world where political activism among filmmakers is both common and easily disseminated. It also shows the conflict in which China can find itself, culturally seeking Hollywood’s approval but politically worried about its criticisms.

Zhao could be another source of those broadsides. The director, 39, was born in China, but spent much of her teenage years in the United Kingdom and her adulthood in the United States. Her film, a front-runner for the best picture prize since it won top honors at the Venice and the Toronto Film Festivals in September, was first celebrated in China, with media awash in news of its April release.

AD

Zhao’s stepmother is a popular actress, Song Dandan, and her father a successful businessman. When she won the Golden Globe for directing and her film won best motion picture-drama in February, people in China poured on to social-media sites to express their pride, and official media outlets congratulated Zhao Ting, as she is known there.

But shortly after, comments surfaced from a 2013 Filmmaker Magazine interview in which Zhao said the country was “a place where there are lies everywhere.” Many of China’s so-called netizens quickly disavowed her, and soon promotional materials for “Nomadland” disappeared online. The film is now unlikely to be released in China. And the decision to tape-delay the Oscars is seen as a way to ensure any political comments she makes can be scrubbed out.

There is even a possibility “Better Days” is perceived as problematic by Chinese regulators. The movie drew 11 nominations at the government-sanctioned Golden Rooster awards in November. But Tsang has since been cut out of a role on a popular reality show, possibly because netizens discovered an alleged picture of him at the Umbrella Revolution, a set of Hong Kong protests in 2014, and his standing in the country is unclear.

AD

Experts on China-Hollywood relations say they see important consequences in the Oscars dynamic — particularly since Zhao directed upcoming Marvel movie “Eternals.” The November film would seem to be a slam dunk to nab a coveted distribution slot in China; Disney has a strong relationship with the Chinese government and Marvel films tend to perform extremely well there. But Zhao’s comments at or around the Oscars could change that.

“I think if she says something about China it will be interesting, and if she doesn’t that will be interesting for an entirely different reason,” said Aynne Kokas, a University of Virginia professor and author of “Hollywood Made In China,” about their relationship. “There’s a financial imperative for her not to tick off the Chinese government. But maybe she sees a moral imperative to stand her ground.”

A spokeswoman for Searchlight Pictures, the Disney-owned unit that has released and is campaigning “Nomadland,” declined to comment. She referred Zhao requests to her publicist, who was not immediately available for comment.

The Oscars controversy suggests the friction that can happen between two forms of current Hollywood: the activist one intent on speaking out about human rights and the corporate one interesting in packaging global product for a wide audience.

Even as the biggest studios such as Disney, Paramount and Universal go out of their way to make apolitical movies that will pass muster with regulators, they can still get caught up in controversy. Disney owns Searchlight, which makes more independent-minded movies, and hired Zhao for “Eternals” in a bid to bring new perspectives to its storytelling.

The world’s second Easter under pandemic brings more restrictions and a few bright spots,"Little is different as many Christians celebrate Easter this Sunday, but there are some bright spots as vaccination levels rise and some restrictions ease.

In Canada, where several provinces imposed new rules this week to temper a variant-fueled resurgence of coronavirus cases, officials from all levels of government and political stripes urged against in-person Easter gatherings with those outside one’s household, particularly those held indoors.

“I know I’ve said the same thing before every major holiday over the past year,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa. “But this time, what’s different is that even if the end of the pandemic is in sight, the variants mean the situation is even more serious.”

Pope Francis, for the second year, will deliver his annual Easter message to a St. Peter’s Square empty of worshipers. In South Africa, where some restrictions have been eased, indoor religious gatherings were restricted to 250 people, and outdoor ones to 500 people, ahead of the holiday.

At an Easter vigil service on Saturday, the pontiff looked forward to the end of the pandemic so people could rediscover “the grace of everyday life.” The service began two hours earlier than usual under Rome’s 10 p.m. curfew.

Much of Europe, beset by variants, is also back under lockdowns, though less stringent ones than during the first round of global shutdowns in March and April of last year.

AD

France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Italy, among others, have all issued increased restrictions on movement and meetings with Easter events in mind. (Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter on May 2.)

In France, people cannot travel more than six miles from their home except in certain exempted cases under rules that took effect Saturday. Yet President Emmanuel Macron said the restrictions would be less strictly enforced over the Easter weekend.

Belgium has barred nonessential travel from outside the country, though it has allowed movement to continue within. Spain, in contrast, has permitted European travelers with negative coronavirus tests to enter, even though movement between regions is restricted, the Guardian reported.

AD

In Italy, the country has been classed as a high-risk “red zone,” which means people are banned from traveling beyond their home regions for Easter celebrations. The government, however, has permitted Italians to still travel abroad and imposed testing and quarantine rules for anyone entering the country.

Authorities in Britain just eased restrictions after a three-month-long lockdown. There are fears that large Easter gatherings will be difficult to prevent.

In Jerusalem, religious sites that were shut down this time last year are open to a limited number of worshipers as communal life in vaccine-saturated Israel returns. Still, there will be none of the usual influx of pilgrims, as travel into the country remains restricted. The Czech Republic has eased its nightly curfew to allow for Easter religious events.

In Australia, some 60,000 people a day can attend the Royal Easter Show at Sydney’s Olympic Park for the annual showcase of Australian traditions. Authorities, however, remain mindful of the pandemic: A contact-tracing system is ready in case any coronavirus cases are detected.

"Bull masks and Boneteros: Carnival is canceled in Mexico, but lavish costumes live on","While Carnival season may be better known in places such as Rio de Janeiro and New Orleans, Mexico has celebrations of its own.

In the state of Veracruz, some communities celebrate Carnival from February to May, during the end of the sugar-cane-cutting season. But this year, because of the pandemic, celebrations have been canceled to avoid the spread of the coronavirus. Still, people have found a way to celebrate at home.

The town of Tuzamapan, located in the center of Veracruz, and Almolonga, an Afro-Mexican community, have celebrated Carnival for more than 100 years.

The main character of the Tuzamapan Carnival is the “Bonetero,” named after a large hat made of paper and wood. Men wear the hat with a wooden mask that covers their identity and carry a large, wooden machete as part of their costume.



The tradition of the bonetero holder has been lost with the passage of time since the costume is very expensive. The older residents fear that because of the pandemic and the uncertainty of the next Carnival, the bonetero could be lost. (Hector Adolfo Quintanar Pérez)

In Almolonga, people dress in colorful bull masks, which are a sign of masculinity and also sin, and they dance and celebrate in the streets.

In the community of Alto Tío Diego in Veracruz, Carnival is celebrated before the beginning of Lent and traditionally includes large parades.

The inhabitants are mostly coffee and sugar cane farmers, with some ranchers. Their ancestors were descendants of European immigrants who settled in the region in the 19th century. They adopted the Carnival tradition and costumes of the surrounding Afro-descendant towns. Popular mask shapes include donkeys, bulls and goats, and they are often hand-carved and passed down for generations.

‘They have another door’: Kenya’s vaccine rollout exposes rich-poor divide,"Amid the ensuing shouts from the crowd were denunciations of a more insidious plague here in Kenya: public services that work for those with connections and money and relegate everyone else to the back of the line.

AD

“They have another door for their friends,” said Mary Njoroge, 58, one of the teachers. “Without a godfather to help you through this process, what are you supposed to do?”

AD

Kenya procured around 1 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses through Covax, a World Health Organization-backed global vaccine distribution effort, and began administering them free of charge last month. The scene at Ngong Sub-County Hospital was a microcosm of how some people here have experienced the rollout: slowly and confusingly if you are poor, quickly and simply if you’re not.

Margaret Kamau, the head of the vaccination unit at Ngong Sub-County Hospital, denied allegations that nurses allowed people to jump the line.

AD

Juliana Nderitu, the other teacher, said she had tried booking appointments online at private hospitals, but websites were glitchy. Tuesday was the pair’s second day of waiting since dawn, putting their trust in what was meant to be a first-come-first-serve system for eligible recipients, a group that now includes various essential workers and all adults over the age of 58.

AD

“There was no proper planning when it came to this rollout, and that’s why you are seeing this type of confusion,” said Chibanzi Mwachonda, acting secretary general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union.

In a news conference Thursday, Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe appealed for patience.

AD

“We are happy that there is great demand for the vaccine from Kenyans,” Kagwe said. “Let us not panic or become anxious. The government will provide vaccines for all adults in Kenya in a phased approach.”

As of Thursday, Kenya has administered first doses to just over 160,000 of its 54 million people, a relatively slow rate compared to other countries. Second-dose appointments are being given for May and June.

The country’s health ministry says it aims to fully vaccinate half of the population by June 2022, relying primarily on Covax, although donations from wealthier countries are expected to pick up once their own vaccination campaigns slow down.

Late last month, amid a surge in case numbers and dwindling hospital space that centered on Nairobi, the capital, the government reimposed domestic movement restrictions and expanded the hours of a curfew that has been in place for more than a year. For five months last year Kenya closed its borders, but for now international travelers can still come and go.

Like in last year’s lockdown, however, the government has offered little support to the vast majority of Kenyans who work in the informal sector and whose ability to work is severely curtailed by the restrictions, hardening a belief among many that the government’s precautionary measures are mainly meant to protect the wealthy while leaving the poor even more vulnerable.

An opaque rollout of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine on the private market in March, as well as news reports that Nairobi’s large United Nations staff contingent and diplomatic corps are being offered Covax vaccines by the government, have raised questions about the government’s priorities involving whom to vaccinate first. (On Friday, Kagwe announced that Kenya would no longer allow companies to import, distribute or administer vaccine doses.)

AD

Earlier this week in an apparent promotion, two of Kenya’s most well-known and media-savvy lawyers, each with around a million followers on Twitter, claimed to be the first and second people in the country to get the Russian vaccine, which was being sold for around $100 for both doses.

The vaccine, which is not approved by the WHO, was granted emergency-use authorization in Kenya, but health officials scrambled in recent days to explain how private medical care providers administering doses to prominent personalities fell under emergency provisions.

Those seeking free vaccines in wealthier parts of Nairobi have also simply found it easier to stroll into a hospital and find vaccines without waiting in line.

AD

Joseph Mutisya, a physiotherapist, said he breezed through the process at Nairobi Hospital, the country’s largest private health facility. He made an appointment through the hospital’s website, and being familiar with computers was less deterred by the glitches it had.

AD

“I came in with my booking message, I showed my doctor’s practice license to qualify, they gave me a number to wait, they called it, I registered my details and I got the vaccine,” he said. “The whole process did not take more than 45 minutes.”

Less than half a mile away, at Mbagathi Hospital, a public institution that largely serves the sprawling slum of Kibera, hundreds of people clamored outside the gate, where confusion reigned.

A security guard at the hospital, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorized to speak to the media, said crowds gather each day by the time she reports for work before 6 a.m.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Russia’s ‘foreign agent’ law now threatens rights group that survived even Soviet pressures,"The foreign agent law has proved to be a highly effective tool by authorities to harass and fragment Russia’s pro-democracy activists and others — just one part of a sweeping crackdown on Kremlin critics under Russian President Vladimir Putin.

AD

The penalties, which took effect in March, can bring up to five years of jail for those who do not obey a government order to register as foreign agents, or fail to submit regular detailed reports of all plans, activities and finances.

AD

The first five individuals named as foreign agents include a feminist performance artist who teaches Russian to migrants, a 79-year-old veteran human rights activist named Lev Ponomaryov and three independent journalists who contribute to U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL).

The changes also claimed one of the giants of Russia’s human rights world, Ponomaryov’s For Human Rights NGO, with more than 1,000 activists across Russia.

“It’s a kind of cold civil war,” said Ponomaryov, who dissolved For Human Rights on March 2.

Now, several organizations are under intense state pressure.

AD

They include some smaller groups such as an independent doctors union and an organization supporting victims of domestic violence.

The list also includes some venerable names: the Russia operations of RFE/RL, and Memorial, the NGO founded by Sakharov, Ponomaryov and others that began work exposing Soviet political executions and the gulag, the vast network of Soviet prison camps where thousands of political prisoners served sentences of hard labor, many of whom perished.

AD

“In Soviet times, especially in the era of Great Terror, we had ‘spies’ everywhere. And the term ‘foreign agent’ in Russian is perceived to mean a spy. The government is trying to put the label ‘spy’ on people who are criticizing the government and disagreeing with its policy and politics,” said Marina Agaltsova, senior lawyer at Memorial.

An initial 2012 law targeted registered NGOs that receive foreign funds, but it has steadily been broadened. In 2017, Russia named RFE/RL a foreign agent in retaliation for American demands that Kremlin-funded Russian media in the United States register as foreign agents.

AD

Russia’s Justice Ministry has mounted 260 cases against RFE/RL for failing to mark its reports with a “foreign agent” label, with fines of $980,000 in 142 of those cases since Jan. 14.

In September, agents of Russia’s Anti-Extremist Center, posing as book lovers, raided Moscow’s international book fair and pounced on Memorial’s stand. They seized nine books and catalogues and laid charges that the materials had no label that Memorial was a “foreign agent.”

Then in December, police raided Memorial’s office, demanding thousands of documents going back three years.

It has so far been fined a total of 6.1 million rubles, nearly $85,000. “An incredible amount for an NGO,” said Agaltsova.

Memorial grew out of the Perestroika Club in Moscow in 1987 when several hundred activists met regularly in a hall to discuss the history of Soviet terrorism, environmental problems and the preservation of historical buildings.

AD

AD

Such meetings would be difficult under Putin today. Around 200 municipal deputies and activists met in a Moscow hotel on March 13, and all were arrested.

Memorial’s struggle for official recognition took years, although activists recall the euphoria and hope of the time. It was “a feeling that suddenly a window had opened and fresh air had blown in,” said one founder, Irina Vysochina.

Sakharov addressed its founding conference in 1989. On Oct. 30 that year, Memorial formed a human chain with candles around the KGB building — another event that could not happen in Putin’s Russia. (The whole of central Moscow was blocked off by riot police in January this year to bar a planned protest at the building.)

AD

Sakharov died in December 1989. At his funeral, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told Sakharov’s widow, Yelena Bonner, that he would give thought to perpetuating her husband’s memory. She answered that registering Memorial was the best way to do so. A month later, Memorial’s Moscow branch was registered.

AD

With parliamentary elections due in September, the Kremlin is cracking down hard on independent journalists, activists and critics.

Media outlets critical of the Kremlin have been declared extremist and forced to close. Journalists and elderly scientists have been charged with treason or justifying terrorism. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, poisoned with a Soviet-era chemical nerve agent last August, was jailed on his return to Russia in January, and many members of his team were arrested and put under house arrest or forced to flee the country.

Darya Apakhonchich, a feminist performance artist who teaches Russian to migrants in her spare time, was shocked to be one of the first five individuals named as “foreign agents.” She knew she would never again get a teaching job in a state or private school.

AD

AD

“I thought it was so crazy, so absurd. I lost my normal life. It took me a few weeks to realize this is not a dream, it’s not a nightmare. This is your new life. I understood that it’s not possible to be an activist and to live a normal life.”

Apakhonchich, evicted by her landlord after being named a foreign agent, sees the law as a form of state violence.

“Unfortunately, we have abusers in our country, and they are very strong.”

Also evicted from their premises after being named foreign agents was No to Violence, an NGO that supports domestic violence survivors.

In February, the landlord appeared at the door with a posse of “brats in leather jackets” when workers were counseling women clients, according to director Anna Rivina. He told her the NGO was “unpleasant” and gave it a month to vacate.

AD

AD

Whenever Rivina, Apakhonchich or other “foreign agents” write posts on social media or make public speeches, they must begin by stating that they “perform the functions of a foreign agent.” So must all employees or members of “foreign agent” NGOs, according to Agaltsova, Memorial’s lawyer.

RFE/RL is obliged to mark all reports under its title.

Agaltsova believes Memorial is targeted for exposing Soviet abuses uncomfortable for Russian security agencies. She has fought many court battles to access Soviet archives, against increasing resistance from authorities, meaning the names of many of those responsible for Soviet-era repressions remain a state secret.

AD

“The repressions of the past are painful because they inevitably touch on the repressions of the present,” she said.

But activists insist they will fight on. Ponomaryov had to close his beloved rights organization, but he is not done yet.

"More scrutiny expected for Marine Corps after fatal, ‘preventable’ disaster at sea","Marine Corps officials and staff members in the House discussed the matter this week, said Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee’s subcommittee on readiness. What they shared, coupled with the details in the investigation, made clear to him that the service has a “systemic, cultural safety problem” that also includes fatal vehicle rollovers and aircraft collisions in training over the last few years, he said.

AD

AD

“It cuts across the entire Corps, it is outrageous, it is deadly, and it has to change,” Garamendi said in an interview.

The congressman said that committee members will be briefed by Marine Corps officials about safety issues next week, and that he will seek participation from Gen. David H. Berger, the service’s commandant, at an open hearing in May.

“I will invite the commandant to testify about the culture of safety — or, rather, the lack of a safety culture in the Marine Corps, and demand answers to how the Marine Corps plans to deal with this,” Garamendi said.

The recent disasters include a 2018 collision between an F/A-18 jet and a KC-130 plane off the coast of Japan that killed six Marines and a 2016 accident in which two CH-53E helicopters crashed into each other off the coast of Hawaii, killing 12.

AD

AD

In both cases, training problems were exposed. In the Japan case, an initial service investigation blamed the fighter jet pilot for being unqualified, but a second investigation overturned the results and said there were systemic problems in his squadron that senior Marine officers had overlooked.

Senior service officials have acknowledged mistakes in the disaster and taken steps to discipline several officers. Among them is Col. Christopher Bronzi, who was removed last week as commander of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit after deploying with the unit last fall despite the mishap.

Before the deployment, the Marine Corps removed Lt. Col. Michael Regner, the commander of 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, an infantry unit that oversaw the service members who were killed, and a more junior company commander who reported to Regner and Bronzi.

But there has been less transparency about other Marines involved.

AD

AD

Lt. Gen. Karsten Heckl, the commanding general of I Marine Expeditionary Force, of San Diego, has “taken appropriate administrative disciplinary action against seven other personnel whose failures contributed to the mishap,” said Capt. Andrew Wood, a Marine Corps spokesman. The former commander of 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, which supplied several decrepit amphibious assault vehicles (AAVs) involved in the disaster, also could face discipline, Wood said.

The Marine Corps has not detailed what those other punishments included, or if anyone will be court-martialed. In the investigation report, Lt. Gen. Steven Rudder, the commanding general of Marine Corps Forces Pacific, recommended that several Marines receive “administrative or disciplinary action"" for dereliction in the performance of duties, including the former commander of 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, the company commander removed from his job last fall, and the platoon commander of the AAVs involved.

A senior officer involved in the case, Maj. Gen. Robert Castellvi, also “bears some responsibility” in the disaster for not ensuring that the Marines received all necessary training, Rudder found. The AAV platoon had not received required screening known as a Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation.

AD

AD

But Castellvi was not disciplined because the Marines involved had been transferred to serve under Bronzi, and Bronzi was the senior Marine officer on hand. Castellvi has since become the Marine Corps inspector general. Wood said that he was chosen because he was the best qualified officer for the job.

The investigation also raised the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic complicated completing all required training. But officers overseeing the unit were still expected to do so.

The dead included Pfc. Bryan J. Baltierra, 18, of Corona, Calif.; Lance Cpl. Marco A. Barranco, 21, of Montebello, Calif.; Pfc. Evan A. Bath, 19, of Oak Creek, Wis.; Navy Hospitalman Christopher Gnem, 22, of Stockton, Calif.; Pfc. Jack Ryan Ostrovsky, 21, of Bend, Ore.; Lance Cpl. Guillermo S. Perez, 20, of New Braunfels, Tex; Cpl. Wesley A. Rodd, 23, of Harris, Tex.; Lance Cpl. Chase D. Sweetwood, 18, of Portland, Ore.; Cpl. Cesar A. Villanueva, 21, of Riverside, Calif.

AD

AD

Seven Marines in the vehicle, including the vehicle commander, survived.

Christiana Sweetwood, of Danville, Va., whose son was just short of turning 19 when he died, said in an interview that she is concerned that some of the lower-ranking Marines who have been disciplined may have been “thrown under the bus,” while more senior officers who gave them direction have avoided accountability.

“Why are these men allowed to be in control of people’s lives period anymore? No more. That’s the angry part of me speaking,” she said. ""Are these generals getting off and these lower-level guys taking the blame?”

Sweetwood said several of the families involved have begun talking to the families of Marines killed in other training accidents about the Feres Doctrine, which bars the military from being sued in cases of documented negligence.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"For 100 days, religious scholars sent Trump letters about scripture and modern life. Now they’re writing to Biden.","Byron’s letter was part of a 2017 project that had 100 American religion scholars each write one letter to the president, vice president and members of Congress for the administration’s first 100 days. The goal was to bring a vast range of scriptural wisdom and expertise to the issues of a bitter, difficult time — and to implore the country’s highest political leaders to pay attention.

AD

AD

The project came to be known as “American Values, Religious Voices,"" and now includes a 2,000-subscriber daily newsletter, a book, a website with letter-writers reading their missives on video and a performance in February that featured actors and musicians who brought the letters to life.

A new round of 350-word missives is now underway with the Biden administration: One letter every day for 100 days from religious experts including those in Hindu studies, biblical preaching, Christian ethics, Orthodox culture, Asian philosophy and Old Testament literature. They are being delivered to the inboxes of chiefs of staff and legislative directors across the country. (Each day, one is put in snail mail, too, for good measure.)

In 2017, they received just one reply from a staffer with then-Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.) This year, so far the only interaction has been with U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), who participated in the Feb. 15 Presidents’ Day live performance animating the letters. The desire for a bigger response is part of the reason the project is back up and running again for the Biden Administration, along with occasional e-mails with the subject line: “Are you reading our letters?”

Last time, said campaign coordinator Rabbi Andrea Weiss, many religious leaders were alarmed by a president they saw as deeply in conflict with scriptural values. This time, with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and deep division over the 2020 election, Weiss said, “I was like, ‘We need the letters again.’”

AD

AD

Writing to societal leaders in particular, Byron said, is essential because scripture is about accountability. It’s also about calls for repentance. “That’s why this is such an important project to me. It’s not just that Jesus [on Easter] rose from the dead. He got up so we, too, can live resurrected lives. We have a responsibility as people of faith. Not just for Christians or for believers, it’s for any human being, any citizen of this country has a responsibility to hold our leaders accountable,” she said.

Letter 73, dated April 2, is by Love Sechrest, a New Testament professor at Columbia Theological Seminary. Calling leaders to sign voting rights legislation, even if it means overturning the filibuster, she cited the book of Ephesians as telling leaders to deal with societal division by both unifying and truth-telling.

“This means telling the truth that our multiracial democracy is a recent, beautiful, and fragile thing, held together by organizers from Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and White communities,” she wrote to Biden, Vice President Harris and others. “Today, if we are to make our way back from hate crimes, an insurrection, and the politics of grievance, then reconciliation must go hand in hand with truth telling and unity-preserving structures. ... Proclaiming that strangers and aliens are welcome in the household of God, Ephesians insists that leaders must speak the truth in love because we are in the same boat together.""

Weiss, who is provost and a professor at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and lives in Philadelphia, said the idea for the letter campaign came the day after the 2016 election. In her classes she had been scheduled to teach the Exodus lesson an eye for an eye.

AD

AD

“I thought, ‘I can’t do that.’ I wanted to share the biblical texts, psalms and other things I was turning to for comfort, perspective, insight,” she said.

The campaign seems to have taken off for a few reasons. One is that many of the letter-writers were Trump critics, in part because of what they saw as his crass and phony use of religion. They loved that the effort celebrated — all in letters directed to the power elite — the call in all faith traditions to policies around welcoming the stranger, caring for the outcasts and the needy.

Rabbi Daniel Zemel of Temple Micah in Northwest Washington said the letters, which he gets through a subscription, are a “daily touchstone about what my week can be.” In 2017, when he felt he was “in the wilderness, in a country I no longer recognized” as a religious progressive, he was soothed by religiously and ethnically disparate voices articulating similar ideas of American values. In 2021, he says, the project of building a multi-faith conversation continues.

AD

AD

“In the petty day-to-day, I believe in keeping a picture of a bigger vision of the country. [The Religious Voices project] does this. I think we need these kinds of things to regain our common Americanism.”

Homayra Ziad, director of the Islamic Studies program at Johns Hopkins University, one of the returning letter-drafters, is thinking about what she wants to write for her 2021 missive. Her 2017 letter was one of the most popular, according to Weiss, though Ziad now looks on it with mixed feelings. Her Letter 92, dated April 21 of that year, focused on the prophet Muhammad’s sense of humor, which she says is often played down in historic writings about him, and how Islam is saying that society needs leaders who show empathy, humanity, mercy and humor.

While she believes humor is a sacred value, Ziad sees in her letter the fear many Muslim Americans really felt with Trump’s election in 2016. “I chose to remain more light than normal because we were deathly scared.”

AD

AD

As a progressive, Ziad has a different posture towards the new administration and Congress as she considers what to write this time. But her thinking is no less urgent. She wants religious progressives to be seen and acknowledged more by leaders, to “express values that stand for liberation.” She wants academics to take religious values “out of the ivory tower” and apply them more to the communities where they live.

“We want to translate religious values in a way that anyone can understand,” she said.

Byron says she sees the letters more as a holy exercise, like Paul’s epistle in the Bible; they are meant for her audience or whomever reads them.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"Shaped by Black Lives Matter, Gen Z watches Chauvin trial with cynicism and urgency: ‘What’s next?’","Wright’s family listened that summer as prosecutors denounced a vigilante who chased after a Skittles-toting 17-year-old in a hoodie. They listened as the other side argued self-defense, and they heard when the case that launched the Black Lives Matter movement ended in acquittal.

“Can he go to trial for something else?” Wright remembers asking.

AD

AD

For Wright and many high school and college-age members of Gen Z, their formative years brought gut punch after gut punch to their faith in the American criminal justice system. Other widely protested deaths of Black Americans followed Martin’s, spawning hashtags and headlines but either no charges or no convictions: Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. Freddie Gray. Breonna Taylor.

Now, the generation that grew up with Black Lives Matter — increasingly activist, attuned to inequity, more likely than their elders to see far-reaching problems behind George Floyd’s killing last May — is watching another case in which they have been anguished bystanders but also key witnesses and drivers of change. A White ex-police officer is in the hands of a court system that near-majorities of young adults have long viewed as unlikely to deliver justice free from racial bias.

For Gen Z, Floyd’s case is “an orienting point for all their political values coming to life,” said John Della Volpe, who directs polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and is writing a book on the “Zoomer” generation, often defined as those born from 1997 to 2012. “It’s like Floyd being suffocated is almost a metaphor for millions of other vulnerable people not having the opportunity that White people have had in this country.”

Like many of her peers, Wright says her outrage does not start with Floyd’s death and will not end with Chauvin’s trial. She spent the summer after high school making TikToks about Breonna Taylor. Attending college from home in West Point, Ga., she tuned in this fall to a bond hearing in the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery — a still-pending case that went without arrests for months in a town several hours southeast.

AD

AD

“The problems in our justice system are way too big to be reassured by one case,” Wright said. She hoped the nation would “do the right thing.” But all she could do was watch.

Homework in hand, she listened this week as two young women, also 18, recounted to the court how Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck until he went quiet and limp. The teens testified off-camera because, as the judge put it, “these are children who did not choose to be a part of this case.”

“It was difficult because I felt like there really wasn’t anything I could do,” said Alyssa Funari, who drove to Cup Foods with a friend.

“It’s been nights I stayed up apologizing and apologized to George Floyd for not doing more,” said Darnella Frazier, whose cellphone video would change the course of history.

AD

Wright, too, had felt a horrible helplessness.

“Even though I wasn’t there, I watched the video as if I was there,” Wright said. “As if I was standing exactly where she was.”

Jolt to a generation

More racially and ethnically diverse than any generation that came before it, Gen Z is no monolith, with differences of opinion along the usual lines of skin color, class and political party. Compared with people of color, White Americans were less supportive of last summer’s protests and less critical of police, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll.

AD

But the jolt of Floyd’s killing would in some ways cross demographic gulfs, experts say.

Last fall’s Harvard Youth Poll found what it called “overwhelming support” across races for more government action to confront systemic racism. Pew Research said in the fall that more than half of White Republican adults under 30 years old reported taking steps to educate themselves on racial inequality in the past few months, notably higher than White Republicans overall.

“So younger Whites were more aligned with other younger people, and not necessarily their parents and their grandparents,” said Della Volpe, a longtime leader in surveys of U.S. youths.

Floyd’s killing was another call to action for a generation that already mobilized on mass shootings and climate change — a group that shares many values with the millennials before them but stands out for their sense of “urgency,” as Della Volpe puts it.

He said Floyd’s death and the racial reckoning that followed is “certainly one of a top five, if not the most significant event in the political development, the political maturation of Generation Z.” Young adults lagged behind their elders in tracking news about the coronavirus pandemic and the election, but that gap disappeared when it came to last year’s Floyd protests, according to Pew.

The O.J. Simpson murder trial in the 1990s was also seemingly inseparable from big questions about race and justice in the United States. Black and White Americans were sharply divided at the time on Simpson’s guilt but united in the belief that the trial hurt race relations and undermined faith in police and courts.

“All of America stopped and watched almost every moment of that trial,” Della Volpe said.

Chauvin’s case feels different to him. He pointed to the other national stories competing for attention in a tumultuous year — a pandemic, a new president.

But young people said that even if they do not regularly tune in to the trial, they will be reading the news, absorbing the reactions on social media and tensing for a verdict.

AD

A not-guilty finding would electrify a new wave of activists, predicted Armonee Jackson, a 23-year-old from Phoenix who leads the youth and college division of the NAACP in Arizona. She sees Floyd’s killing as an especially weighty turning point for the younger members of Gen Z: “This was their Trayvon Martin,” she said, recounting the hoodie she wore to eighth grade in protest of Martin’s death.

AD

“This is going to be a make-or-break,” Jackson said, adding, “It’s either going to push them harder or not, depending on the outcome of the case.”

As lawyers gave their opening statements at the Hennepin County Government Center, a small group of youth-driven, women-led protesters briefly blocked the road outside, carrying a mock white coffin.

AD

A guilty verdict for Chauvin, meanwhile, would feel like the bare minimum to Foyin Dosunmu, 17, who organized a protest last June with two other teenagers, hoping to light more of an activist fire in their suburban Houston hometown.

“It’s something that’s supposed to happen,” Dosunmu said. She said she expects to be out protesting this summer regardless of whether Chauvin is found guilty.

She compared a conviction to Joe Biden and Kamala D. Harris winning the election in November.

“I’d be like, okay, good. What’s next?”

Pushing for more

Young people following Chauvin’s trial see far more work ahead. There are other causes to fight for, whole “carceral systems” to abolish, elders to persuade who may agree on what to do with Chauvin but not what to do with the Minneapolis Police Department.

“Our generation is more radical,” said Jackson, describing a justice system so harmful to people of color that reform is not enough.

“Their mind is on equity. Their mind is on justice,” said Alisha Smith Jean-Denis, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst whose research focuses on students. “They’re calling these things out definitely more. There’s a boldness.”

Smith Jean-Denis said she was struck last week when her 14-year-old daughter asked her on the drive to school, “Ma, did you know that a six-year-old boy was arrested for picking a flower?”

“She’s getting this from social media. … I wasn’t thinking about that at 14,” Smith Jean-Denis said. “ I knew things were happening, but I was not as aware. ”

Adults under 35 — a mix of Gen Zers and millennials — were the most likely to favor overhauls of policing, according to a Gallup poll from last summer. More than 80 percent said “major changes” were needed, compared with 61 percent of the 35-to-49 cohort and less than half of older groups.

AD

For some young people, the generational divides in their circles extend to Chauvin, too, as his trial reopens fault lines with older, more conservative loved ones that emerged last summer.

Eighteen-year-old Jeffrey Jin, who also led racial justice demonstrations near Houston, has seen lots of people on Twitter talking about how “it’s the Derek Chauvin trial and not the George Floyd trial,” as Chauvin’s defense makes the drugs found in Floyd’s system key to their case. He agrees — and said he hopes to talk with an older family member who months ago dismissed Floyd as a “thug” on narcotics.

“It’s a conversation I want to have with her,” Jin said. “If she doesn’t bring it up, I probably will.”

‘Why is history repeating itself?’

Wright first saw Floyd’s name while browsing Facebook last May, a few days after high school graduation. She scrolled on.

AD

“I’m kind of desensitized to seeing Black men killed in the media and nothing be done about it,” she said. “I didn’t want to overwhelm myself with something that I didn’t really think was going to change.”

Then, on Instagram, she saw the video of Chauvin, who is White, kneeling on Floyd’s neck while the Black man said he could not breathe. She started crying when Floyd called for his mom. She remembered, vividly, the video of another Black man who died after police pinned him to the ground.

With Floyd, the alleged offense that initiated the encounter with police was passing a counterfeit $20 bill; with Eric Garner in 2014, it was selling unauthorized cigarettes.

“I can’t breathe!” Garner had also cried out before losing consciousness as New York police put him in a chokehold.

“I was like, why is history repeating itself?” Wright said.

“The Trayvon Martin case cracked the foundation,” she said. “And then … George Floyd, I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back.”

She decided she wanted to become a lawyer, filing a form to switch her major. She went on TikTok, sick of her conservative county, hoping to reach more young people who saw Floyd’s killing as a symptom of pervasive racism.

“Put a finger down if you live in the South and you’ve been blocked by nine White people on Snapchat in the past week because now you’re an uncontrollable Black girl …” she began, talking rapid-fire, in her first TikTok video. It went up May 30, five days after Floyd’s death.

With Chauvin swiftly arrested and then charged with murder, Wright turned to Breonna Taylor, the young Black woman fatally shot by police in Louisville.

“We do not need to take our foot off the gas pedal because we have reached justice for George Floyd,” Wright said in a video.

On Tuesday, Wright said, her family yelled at the TV — “He’s trying to discredit her!” — as Chauvin’s defense attorney questioned a distraught firefighter. On Wednesday, Wright found herself crying along with a 61-year-old witness after Floyd called out on video for his dead mother. It was just like the first time she watched.

She said she feels a duty to keep tuning in, as an aspiring lawyer and as a citizen, “as bad as it gets.”

“Our criminal justice system is on trial right now,” she said. “And I fully intend on watching every moment of it.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Defense-tech company Anduril buys Area-I, a manufacturer of tube-launched drones","Anduril was founded by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey and staffed with former employees and executives of the big data surveillance company Palantir. Over the past several years, Anduril built a steady business providing border surveillance towers for the Department of Homeland Security. But the company is eying a much larger market for military hardware, where a handful of aerospace companies have long been dominant. It has invested in a D.C.-based engineering workforce meant to expand its military sales.

AD

AD

Chief executive Brian Schimpf, a former Palantir engineering director, said he views Area-I’s drone technology as a way to extend the reach of manned military vehicles including ships, planes and helicopters to “push out sensing and awareness out beyond where it’s probably safe for humans.”

The company’s drones are in use by the Army, Air Force, Navy, NASA and U.S. Special Operations Command. In an interview last week, Area-I founder and chief executive Nick Alley declined to discuss how the company’s government customers tend to use the drones. But the company website suggests a range of possible uses, including surveillance and carrying an unspecified payload. They are designed to fly and carry out their missions autonomously.

Area-I was founded by a group of aerospace researchers out of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Alley taught a course in small aircraft design and started his own company with a team of researchers.

AD

AD

One of the company’s first government contracts was to design a system that could allow a C-130 gunship, widely used as a transport aircraft in dangerous battlefield conditions, to effectively see through clouds. That opportunity led the company to develop a series of tube-launched drones it calls ALTIUS.

Area-I has funded its operations primarily through government contracts and technology development programs meant for small businesses. But the merger with Anduril should give it access to substantial investment capital that will allow it to scale up more quickly.

Under the terms of the deal, Area-I is to operate as an independent subsidiary of Anduril. Alley said this arrangement would allow his company to continue to operate like a tech start-up as opposed to the research unit of a larger company.

“I was very reticent to follow the paths [of] most of my predecessors, which was selling to a large aerospace prime … you can imagine how that would ruin our culture, ruin who we are,” he said. “All of those options were available … but we didn’t pursue them because of what it would do to us as a company.”

Project based learning is better now,"Project-based learning, at least in some schools, is much better now. The best lessons have students work on projects that are tied to a real-world scenario and also teach core academic content. Astonishingly, some teachers are letting students learn from frustration and failure, something that probably would have helped me at that age.

Michelle Fitts, a teacher at East Bay Innovation Academy in Oakland, Calif., told her sixth-grade students to construct a solar cooker using the Learning Through Performance curriculum developed at Stanford University. She gave them no instructions.

AD

One team thought “they could attach the wires from a solar panel to a wire rack inside a cardboard box,” Fitts said. The students assumed the shining of the sun on the panel would transfer heat to the metal rack. She did not correct them.

Through trial and error, they eventually realized the solar panel didn’t work that way. They learned about thermal dynamics in class. With more testing, they discovered that reducing the size of the box, lining it with aluminum foil, putting a pane of glass on top and covering the outside with bubble wrap all increased the heat inside.

In rural Kent City, Mich., Billie Freeland watched her fourth-graders try to produce energy by building a water wheel out of an orange juice carton, a dowel, a Styrofoam ball and plastic spoons. This was part of the Multiple Literacies in Project-Based Learning curriculum developed at Michigan State University. The students used the device to lift washers. “You have students with not just one pitcher of water but two pitchers of water splashing all over,” Freeland said.

In an Advanced Placement U.S. Government and Politics class in Des Moines, high school students were asked to create political action plans on opposing sides for hot issues such as immigration or gun policy. They then met with community leaders, who gave them feedback on their proposals. Others did moot court arguments with actual judges brought in to respond. AP Environmental Science classes had students calculating the ecological footprints of themselves and their families and acting as delegates to a mock international climate accord convention.

Five school districts with large numbers of low-income and minority students used the AP projects designed by the Knowledge In Action program at the University of Washington College of Education.

The Learning Through Performance, Multiple Literacies in Project-Based Learning and Knowledge in Action classrooms showed significant increases in student test scores. But it is difficult to measure the effects of such complex changes in teaching methods, and to find programs that take big enough leaps from Popsicle stick cabins and dioramas.

AD

AD

Until they discovered the Multiple Literacies program, Freeland said, her district’s science committee spent five years searching for a suitable project-based curriculum for elementary school students based on the Next Generation Science Standards, developed by a consortium of 26 states. “Nothing fit the bill,” she said.

For now, teachers’ experiences are the strongest evidence we have that project-based learning is worth the time. Kristin DeVivo, executive director of the nonprofit Lucas Education Research, which helped fund all three curriculums, said “the student project is not the shiny red caboose at the end of the freight train. It is the engine driving student learning.”

Erin Fisher, an AP U.S. Government teacher in Virginia, said that before she adopted the Knowledge in Action curriculum, her classes “were all lecture-based, all me, and it was often boring for my students.” After the introduction of projects, “students were asking more questions, taking control of their learning and doing more research,” she said.

Freeland in Kent City took her third-graders to a local park to study squirrel behavior with binoculars. They collected data on squirrel jumps, comparing that to how far they could jump. They studied squirrel skeletons and dinosaur fossils. That led to them attempting explanations for why dinosaurs disappeared but small mammals survived in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.

Amber Graeber found her AP students in Des Moines struggling with their projects. “They were used to being passive reciters of knowledge,” she said. She kept pushing.

Why does it feel like the D.C. region is behind on vaccinations?,"The District plans to open vaccine appointments to healthy adults on May 1, the latest date that President Biden set as a target for all states. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said his state’s date of April 27 for widespread eligibility will be accelerated in the coming days, while Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced Thursday that everyone age 16 and older who lives or works in the state will become eligible for shots by April 18, almost two weeks ahead of Biden’s deadline. But at the moment, Virginia’s populous D.C. suburbs lag behind much of the state, with essential workers who would be eligible if they lived in more rural areas still unable to get shots in Northern Virginia.

AD

AD

“In order to succeed and be able to meet the governor’s goal, we’re going to need dramatically more doses coming to Northern Virginia,” said Jeff C. McKay (D-At Large), chairman of the county board in Fairfax County, the state’s most populous jurisdiction.

This past week, Fairfax received about 18,000 fewer doses than the previous week, totaling about 46,000, McKay said. “So, we’re moving in the wrong direction.”

The region’s apparent slowness has complex causes, including the federal government’s decision to allocate hundreds of thousands of extra doses to large states but exclude the District and the local emphasis on reserving some doses for hard-to-reach and vulnerable patients rather than funneling all shots as fast as possible to the first people willing to take them.

AD

Then there’s the fact that the Washington area simply has more people who are willing — indeed, eager — to get vaccinated.

AD

With residents constantly clamoring for easier access to vaccines, D.C. Council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large) snapped at the city’s emergency management director at a meeting Wednesday.

“I’m telling you, you’re working, but it ain’t working. It’s as simple as that. It is the most frustrating system that we’ve had to live with,” Bonds said.

From the beginning of the vaccine rollout late last year, D.C. started with fewer doses per person in its patient pool than states, and it has fallen further as the rollout progressed. To start, when the federal government allocated doses to states on a per capita basis, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) asked for extra because of the large number of health-care workers and law enforcement officers who live in the suburbs and aren’t counted in D.C.’s population but were D.C.’s responsibility to vaccinate.

The federal government has repeatedly said no. A large portion of D.C.’s initial shots went to nonresidents, and although that portion has fallen, the city to date has used nearly 30 percent of its shots on nonresidents, making it proportionately harder for D.C. residents to find an appointment than their counterparts in other states.

AD

AD

Then, as the Biden administration secured more doses and promised that the supply to states would sharply increase in spring, D.C. lost out again. The city’s weekly allocation went up, in step with the states. But a large chunk of those new doses went to a Federal Emergency Management Agency program that provides 3,000 to 6,000 extra doses per day to special clinics across the country.

FEMA said it would look for sites for those clinics by starting with the most populous states and working down the list — meaning the District, which the head of FEMA acknowledged has high need for such a clinic, would never qualify because its population is lower than that of almost all states.

Maryland and Virginia have recently been granted these FEMA clinics, in Greenbelt and Norfolk.

Finally, D.C. made choices about how to use the shots it did receive, which resulted in lower immediate usage of the doses.

As residents of Whiter, wealthier neighborhoods have greatly outpaced poorer, majority-Black neighborhoods in vaccination rates, the city chose to allocate less than half of its doses to its citywide registration portal — where most available appointments are snapped up instantly by people savvy enough to navigate the system and eager to get vaccinated — and send the rest to hospitals, nonprofit health clinics and special programs such as clinics at churches and public housing buildings designed to reach poorer residents.

Tamara Smith, who represents the nonprofit health clinics as president of the D.C. Primary Care Association, said clinics have not shared the experience of some corners of the region, where people are keen to get vaccinated. Their clientele, who are mostly low-income people of color, are often ill-informed about the shots and are unaware that they qualify.

AD

AD

Of the nearly 39,000 doses that the clinics have received from the city and 5,600 from the federal government, they’ve used just over half so far, Smith said. The rest won’t go to waste — most clinics have not wasted a single shot — but they might sit on shelves for longer before the clinics can put them to use.

“The reason these federal government doses are coming to the health centers is so we can reach individuals that are disproportionately underrepresented. Yes, you could get it out to all the 25-year-olds that are White from affluent communities. They’d line up and get it. That’s not helping,” Smith said. “We really want to reserve the doses that the health centers are getting for people of color, immigrants, low-income folks. That’s the strategy.”

Smith said some clinics have also struggled to find extra nurses available for hire or to fit patients in their small spaces while observing social distancing. Months into the vaccine rollout, some clinics are still trying to find bigger venues that they can use and to recruit volunteers to help vaccinate. “They all got significant funding. Now it’s about logistics and space and staffing,” Smith said. “They are all planning significant ramp-up strategies.”

AD

AD

Officials from D.C.’s health department and mayor’s office did not answer numerous questions from The Washington Post for this story, including about vaccine usage.

The city claims it has used more than 85 percent of its own 328,990 doses, including those sent to health clinics and those distributed through the portal. But D.C. Health says an additional lot of more than 55,000 doses has been allocated through federal programs — including the 5,600 sent to the clinics — and just 21 percent of those doses have been used.

Giant pharmacies are responsible for some of those unused doses. The longest-running federal relationship in the city is with Giant; CVS locations in the District also joined the federal program recently.

AD

Giant stores have had trouble using their full allotment of doses, to the point that they recently donated 1,000 doses to Johns Hopkins and batches to other hospitals and nonprofits to make sure all their doses would be used, said Giant spokesman Daniel Wolk. In recent weeks, Giant stopped requesting doses from the federal government so it wouldn’t acquire extras.

Meanwhile, in Virginia, a tier of essential workers labeled 1c — including hair stylists, restaurant workers and waste haulers — are eligible in less densely populated areas of the state, but not yet in Northern Virginia.

AD

The patchwork of eligibility has prompted many frustrated residents to go vaccine hunting, driving to Winchester or Danville to get their shots, while those who have played by the rules of their local health districts have quietly seethed.

AD

In Maryland, residents of some suburban areas have also fumed as their jurisdictions moved to open eligibility more slowly than the less dense counties farther from Washington.

Last month, Virginia health officials said they would reallocate doses to Northern Virginia to help the region get to those essential workers faster.

Since March 14, the region’s weekly allocation has increased by 42 percent, to 145,380 by the middle of this past week — a jump that includes more doses distributed by the state to local hospitals and pharmacies.

Local health officials say the extra supplies have helped. But whether they’ll get enough to meet the governor’s deadline is still unknown.

AD

AD

“Provided that necessary supply is received on schedule, we will hopefully be able to reach Phase 2 by the week of April 18,” a spokeswoman for Arlington County’s health department said.

Officials in Alexandria said the current vaccine allocation puts them about two weeks from reaching the final tier of essential workers. Officials in Prince William County, which saw its doses double to 41,720 this past week, declined to offer a timetable. David Goodfriend, the health department director in Loudoun County, said he expects to start allowing doses to go to anyone older than 16 by the middle of the month, in line with Northam’s timetable.

Loudoun gets about 20,000 doses every Monday, then another batch later in the week after state health officials redirect doses from smaller jurisdictions that don’t have enough essential workers seeking them. This past week, the total was 40,000 doses.

AD

Goodfriend said Northern Virginia’s slower pace of vaccinations is largely due to the fact that there are more elderly residents, first responders, health-care workers and people with underlying medical conditions who are eligible and willing to be vaccinated.

A state health department decision in January to change its allocation system to one based on a jurisdiction’s population size instead of how many doses it reported needing also led to far fewer doses coming into Northern Virginia, officials said.

“We just want as many people as possible to get the vaccine,” Goodfriend said. “We know people are still dying from covid.”

Residents who have been biding their time have grown more frustrated.

Bill Merkel, 56, said he has watched in astonishment how some of his younger colleagues at the Public Broadcasting Service station in Arlington have found ways to get vaccinated. Merkel, a director of business intelligence at PBS, would qualify as a working journalist under the state’s final tier for essential workers, which Arlington’s health department says will take another two weeks to reach at the current rate of doses it receives from the state.

Merkel, a widower with two sons, worries that his luck is running out, as more transmissible coronavirus variants again drive up infections. “I can’t get sick,” he said, explaining that there is nobody else to care for his sons. “I have no backstop.”

In the city of Fairfax, Ahmet Sim said he and the 12 employees at his hair salon and spa are also anxiously waiting to learn when they will become eligible.

Sim, 37, said customers calling in recent weeks frequently have the same question before deciding whether to schedule a hair appointment: “Have you all been vaccinated?”

“It’s a big pressure on us,” he said. “They’re saying that if we’re not vaccinated, they’re not going to come to our salon yet.”

Sim said he has been struggling to keep his business afloat during the pandemic. With social distancing, he can host only about half as many clients as before, and he spent $4,000 to upgrade his HVAC system and $3,500 on secondary air filtration. He spends $800 every week to have the salon sanitized.

“Knock on wood, none of us have gotten covid,” said Sim, who in early March preregistered for an appointment under the state health department’s 1c category. “We’re all anxiously waiting.”",2021-04-03 00:00:00
‘One and done’ vaccine clinics serve D.C. homeless,"The men, who have been riding out the coronavirus pandemic at a homeless shelter on New York Avenue, joked that Edward wanted to know the vaccine didn’t hurt Anthony before he got it himself. (They spoke on the condition that their last names not be used as to not jeopardize future employment.)

Just like in the general population, vaccine hesitancy is one of the challenges the District’s outreach workers and homeless advocates have encountered since February when they started vaccinating people who live in shelters, in transitional housing and on the streets.

AD

AD

This week, Unity Health Care, in partnership with a network of organizations that serve the homeless, began offering the vaccine to unsheltered people, who they say are among the hardest to reach for medical care and services.

According to a point-in-time count last spring, there are at least 653 unsheltered people in the District — a subset of homeless who do not stay in shelters — and by Friday about 30 percent of them were vaccinated, said Laura Green Zeilinger, director of the city’s Department of Human Services.

Nurses administered the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which she said was key to protecting a vulnerable population that disproportionately suffers from underlying medical conditions that can make covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, more severe and deadly.

AD

“The ability to have that one and done [shot] . . . so they are protected is absolutely much more efficient and effective because people are transient,” Green Zeilinger said.

AD

Overall, 1,382 homeless individuals in shelters and 740 staff members have gotten at least the first in the two-shot Moderna regimen, and a total of more than 3,300 doses have been administered, she said.

Green Zeilinger spoke in front of a Unity Health mobile clinic parked outside So Others Might Eat, where people lined up in the cold Friday morning awaiting the vaccine. Miriam’s Kitchen and the Downtown Day Services Center hosted similar events Wednesday and Thursday.

Inside, nurses wearing gowns, masks and face shields jabbed needles in upper arms, while people sat quietly for observation for 15 to 30 minutes.

AD

Glenda Robinson, 38, said she procrastinated at first because she was worried about having an allergic reaction, but an outreach worker convinced her to get the vaccine.

“It didn’t hurt because I ain’t scared of needles, so it didn’t bother me. I didn’t look at it when they give it to me,” she said.

AD

Robinson said she has taken substance abuse and parenting classes in hopes of having her children live with her in an apartment. In the meantime, she panhandles.

“They look at me like I’m crazy or stupid,” she said. “I sleep in the woods in a tent and I be cold. Last night I was cold. My stomach was touching my back, I didn’t have nothing to eat. I mean, it’s hard out here.”

AD

The vaccination clinic is part of a response by the city’s Department of Human Services that started a little over a year ago after day centers, libraries and McDonalds locations stopped allowing people to linger. Officials extended shelter hours from overnight to around-the-clock, but that created a set of problems as well.

“When the covid pandemic struck, we in the homeless medical community were really worried about folks living in these large congregant settings,” Catherine Crosland, medical director for homeless outreach services at Unity Heath Care, said in a phone interview Thursday.

AD

The city contracted with hotels to create isolation and quarantine sites for anyone with covid-19 symptoms, known to have covid-19 or close contact with someone with covid-19. Officials recruited hotels to protect individuals for whom the disease could have dire consequences, through the District’s Pandemic Emergency Program for Medically Vulnerable Individuals or PEP-V.

AD

Yolonda Taylor, 48, a nurse practitioner with Unity Health who administered vaccinations Friday, said the PEP-V program in particular has helped her clients tremendously, reinforcing advocates’ “housing is health care” mantra. She was also pleased to see no one change their mind Friday about getting the lifesaving shot.

“It means the difference between life and death,” she said.

In shelters, advocates have relied on what they call “peer to peer outreach,” to encourage vaccine participation.

Outside So Others Might Eat, Anthony and Edward hatched a more informal plan to help a third friend, Joe, get the vaccine now that they are protected.

"In a bid to bring grocers to food deserts, Prince George’s turns to alcohol sales","But there was intense disagreement this year on the solution proposed by officials from Prince George’s, who wanted to reward grocery stores that locate in food deserts by allowing them to sell beer and wine.

That effort, strongly backed by County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D), would have made Prince George’s an outlier in a state that since 1978 has barred grocery stores from selling alcohol.

The bill failed, as did another bill that would have allowed beer and wine to be sold in some grocery stores throughout the state, following intense opposition from the liquor lobby and lawmakers outside Prince George’s. But the county bill, which its supporters want to reintroduce next year, nonetheless spurred a statewide discussion about Maryland’s unusual liquor laws, equity in terms of food access, and why some neighborhoods are saturated with liquor stores.

“There is a social justice case for grocers to locate in these underserved areas, but businesses do not respond to that,” Alsobrooks said in an interview. “Residents ask me all the time, ‘Why can’t we have these stores?’ . . . This would have been another tool in our toolbox to get them here.”

AD

AD

Lawmakers in years past have introduced statewide bills to allow beer and wine to be sold in grocery stores, but gained little traction. Maryland, which has a historically strong liquor lobby, is one of 10 states that does not allow grocery stores to sell alcohol (the few stores that do sell beer and wine have been grandfathered in).

In D.C., which allows beer and wine to be sold in grocery stores, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) this year tried to attract grocers to that city’s food deserts by supporting the introduction of a bill that would have allow grocery stores in Wards 7 and 8 — the city’s poorest wards, which border Prince George’s — to have a permit that is allows 25 percent of their sales to be alcohol, rather than the typical 15 percent. That legislation is awaiting a hearing.

Opponents of the Prince George’s and statewide bills argued the move would put liquor stores out of business, or that it would lead to even more alcohol in communities that already have an abundance of liquor stores.

AD

AD

“You have some areas that are very poor, that don’t have supermarkets, then you want beer and wine to go in there? I don’t know how that mixes,” said Del. Talmadge Branch (D-Baltimore City), a member of the economic matter committee who opposed both bills.

Alsobrooks and the Prince George’s state delegation, which backed the local bill, argued the county is the right place to chart a new course, partly because despite some success, many years of efforts to attract grocery stores — including tax incentives and subsidies — have fallen short.

“If we’re being honest, we have thrown almost everything else at this challenge,” Del. Jazz M. Lewis (D-Prince George’s) said of food deserts. “The industry is telling us they need revenue.”

AD

Lewis, who grew up in Prince George’s, said he was often frustrated to see how many liquor stores there were in communities inside the Beltway — and that was among the chief concerns he heard from residents when he was on the campaign trail in 2018.

AD

Officials say Prince George’s has two liquor stores per square mile in many of its poorest neighborhoods inside the Capital Beltway. Meanwhile, in wealthier, less dense neighborhoods outside the Beltway, there are an average of 0.1 liquor stores per square mile. Access to grocery stores is flipped, with dramatically less access to healthy options inside the Beltway, according to a map created by county officials.

The bill Lewis sponsored has been stripped of the measure that would have allowed beer and wine to be sold in grocery stores. But it is moving forward with a provision that would define an “alcohol density zone” as a census tract with an average of three or more licensed liquor stores per square mile, and allow liquor stores in those areas to apply to relocate to areas with fewer such stores.

AD

Lewis said his hope is that the bill passes and liquor stores, which are currently locked into their locations based on their licenses, begin to move elsewhere on their own.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that low-income neighborhoods are more likely than wealthier ones to have access to liquor stores. And those stores, the 2018 study based in Baltimore City found, are associated with increase in violent crime.

Anne Palmer, who studies food equity at Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future, said what is clear is that residents would generally rather not have too many in their neighborhoods — which raises a question about whether hoping liquor stores move outside the Beltway is a viable solution.

AD

AD

“You may just be relocating the problem,” she said.

Even some supporters of the bill said allowing beer and wine sales in grocery stores spoke to a grim reality that such a measure was necessary. Del. Dereck E. Davis (D-Prince George’s), who chairs the economic matters committee, pointed out that Maryland’s liquor laws have not prevented the most sought-after chains from locating elsewhere in the state, citing the Trader Joe’s in Annapolis.

“If they are right, if that is what it takes to get grocery stores, that says a lot about what those corporations think of certain communities,” Davis said. “It’s a sad commentary on those corporations.”

Cailey Locklair, president of the Maryland Retailers Association, which represents the majority of the state’s grocery stores, said allowing beer and wine to be sold in grocery stores would be “a game-changer” for the industry. She said alcohol sales would be an important revenue stream in an industry in which profits are often no more than 1 to 3 percent — and it would be more practical than local governments doling out grants or subsidies to bring new grocers.

“This allows a store the ability to survive in an area that might not have the demographics or population to support it,” she said.

For Mario Minor, who grew up in Seat Pleasant, opening a grocery store a few miles away in Hampton Park is part of a mission. Minor, a cancer survivor who has had two heart attacks he attributes partly to poor nutrition growing up, said his passion is getting healthy foods into communities like the food desert in which he was raised.

The failure of the bill has not stopped his plans to open a community grocery store, Market Fresh Gourmet, later this year. But he said selling beer and wine along with fruits and vegetables would have provided him an important revenue cushion. And Minor said it is important not just to convince grocers to come to underserved parts of the county, but to ensure that they remain viable once they do.",2021-04-02 00:00:00

In 1899 an Egyptian temple rose in Washington,"That was the name of Smith’s self-funded museum, which opened in 1899 at 1312-1318 New York Ave. NW, where the Inter-American Development Bank stands today.

True to its name, the Halls of the Ancients was chock full of old stuff — or stuff that looked old, anyway. It was a celebration of ancient cultures: Assyrian, Egyptian, Roman and Saracen. It was most notable for its entryway: A re-creation of the Hypostyle Hall of Karnak in Luxor, Egypt. The brightly painted three-story facade was encrusted with ankhs, ibis and those uniquely postured pyramid builders who walked like Egyptians because that’s who they were.

AD

AD

Though the most recent occupant of that corner had been a Lansburgh department store — destroyed by fire in 1896 — many Washingtonians called that spot “the rink.” For years, a roller skating rink had operated there.

By the time Smith built the Halls of the Ancients, he was gray-haired and luxuriantly mutton-chopped. Born in 1826, he made his fortune as a Boston hardware merchant. Smith supplied the U.S. military during the Civil War and was briefly jailed for contracting improprieties. He claimed this was in retaliation for blowing the whistle on corrupt Navy officials and was later pardoned by Abraham Lincoln.

Before and after the war, Smith traveled the globe. In 1851, he visited the Great Exhibition in London’s Crystal Palace.

AD

“I’m guessing he went as a businessperson and came away amazed by the world,” said Jeremy Graboyes, a District lawyer and amateur historian. Graboyes became fascinated by Smith after finding mentions of the Halls of the Ancients in old District guidebooks. He recounted Smith’s story on his blog, DuckPie.com.

AD

Before creating the attraction in Washington, Smith constructed several other history-themed buildings. In Saratoga Springs, N.Y., he built the House of Pansa, a full-scale reconstruction of a Roman villa as described in Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s “The Last Days of Pompeii.” In St. Augustine, Fla., he built a house, the Villa Zorayda, and a hotel, the Casa Monica, inspired by Moorish architecture.

These were fine as far as they went, but Smith harbored a grander scheme: A massive collection of buildings in Washington collectively known as the National Galleries of History and Art.

AD

In an essay promoting his idea, Smith quoted a British critic who damned America as “the apotheosis of Philistinism; where the people are drunk with materialism, and wealth is a curse instead of a blessing.”

Harsh, but Smith thought there was some truth to it. The United States was among the wealthiest nations in the world but only financially, he maintained. It was time to put as much energy into “mental and moral elevation.”

AD

Smith was of the belief that strolling among accurate facsimiles of ancient cultures could infuse Americans with the qualities that had made those cultures successful. He proposed a complex of buildings stretching west from 17th and B streets NW (today’s Constitution Avenue) all the way to the Potomac. Crowning it all — on the bluff where the Naval Observatory stands — would be a temple honoring U.S. presidents: an American Parthenon.

AD

Smith proposed that everything be built of concrete, which he valued for its low cost and malleability.

As Smith lobbied Congress to embrace his plan, he built the Halls of the Ancients. Said Graboyes: “He wanted to redo this whole city, and this was his sales office, basically.”

The attraction was a proof-of-concept undertaking, admission 50 cents. Visitors passed through an Egyptian Hall of the Kings and then into a reproduction 15,000-square-foot Roman house, complete with sunken atrium and a triclinium — dining room — with the sort of couches Romans reclined on while eating.

AD

On the second floor was an Assyrian throne room, a Saracenic Hall and an auditorium for lectures. The third floor featured a model of Smith’s National Galleries.

AD

Graboyes thinks Smith had soured on industrialization and wanted to show Americans a simpler, nobler time. “That’s the sense I get reading his stuff: ‘I want to go back to the ancient world,’ ” he said.

Well, a certain segment of it. There wasn’t room in Smith’s vision for sub-Saharan Africa, Asia or South America.

Said Graboyes: “It’s an old White guy view of the ancient world.”

Though Smith worked tirelessly on his project — welcoming students, church groups and civic organizations to the Halls of the Ancients — Congress never adopted his dream. Washington did get a Classical makeover — the McMillan Plan — but it was simpler, its buildings made of gleaming white stone, not concrete.

AD

AD

That’s probably a good thing.

“We’ve all seen how concrete ages over time,” Graboyes said. “It would have been a mess.”

Smith didn’t own the land on which the Halls of the Ancients stood. It closed in 1905. Smith died in 1911. For a while, a mechanic used the space. Eventually the building was torn down, and in its place rose a temple to a different god: the city’s first multilevel parking garage.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"After fears of cuts and layoffs last year, Maryland passes record $52 billion budget flush with cash","The new spending plan, nearly 12 percent larger than last year’s, builds parks and playgrounds in every county, outfits schools with new ventilation systems, sends cash payments to the poor, gives tax breaks to small businesses and unemployment recipients, and attempts to give broadband access to a half-million residents without it.

“In your wildest dreams, you wouldn’t have expected this a year ago,” Senate Budget and Taxation Chairman Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said.

AD

AD

As Maryland’s financial fortunes changed, Guzzone said his sleepless nights transitioned from fretting about cuts to figuring out how not to squander unexpected tax revenue, a better-than-expected economy and multiple waves of federal stimulus aid.

“It’s been a weight on those of us who think about this every day, because we want to get it right,” Guzzone said.

House Appropriations Chairwoman Maggie McIntosh (D-Baltimore City), a 29-year veteran of the legislature, reminded her colleagues Friday that the nearly $3 billion in federal aid incorporated into the spending plan this week was the latest in good financial news for the state.

“When you have that kind of money, there’s a tendency to want to spend it all,” she said, pointing out that Maryland instead paid back accounts used for pandemic-related expenses and set aside billions in the state’s rainy day fund. “I can easily say it’s one of the most conservative budgets that I’ve been a part of it.”



Del. Wendell R. Beitzel (Garrett), a Western Maryland Republican who said he never has stood up to praise a budget during his 14-year tenure in the legislature’s minority, urged Republicans to join him in voting for it.

AD

AD

“We were looking at some dire circumstances and things have really turned around,” he said.

The spending plan, which takes effect in July, passed the Senate unanimously and cleared the House of Delegates with bipartisan support. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who pitched many of the proposals in the budget, praised the state’s financial plan as evidence that people from different parties can work together.

The budget includes tax revenue from new taxes enacted this year, including a tax on digital streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu.

Last May, after the pandemic shut down entire sectors of the economy and unprecedented unemployment claims overwhelmed Maryland’s system, the state’s forecasters predicted “staggering” losses. The rosiest scenario, issued after the first round of stimulus funding, estimated tax revenue would nose dive by more than 10 percent and create a $2 billion crater on the state’s balance sheets. The doomsday version predicted a $7.7 billion shortfall by the end of 2022.

AD

AD

State officials froze jobs and spending. They cut more than $413 million in state spending in July, stripping money from higher education and selling off state aircraft in what was one of the largest single-day budget cuts in state history.

Then it turned out that state revenue forecasters — like those across the country — were wrong.

“I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on that,” said Andrew M. Schaufele, director of the Bureau of Revenue Estimates.

“That initial estimate in May was kind of a call to arms, and if I knew what I know now, I would have done it differently,” he said. “Honestly, we were victims of short-termism at that point, and I don’t think we had tremendous confidence in the federal government to pull this off. But damn, they did.”

AD

Schaufele said Maryland businesses pivoted to stay open and the state’s consumers kept spending more money than expected. People paid more in taxes than the state guessed, and the economic recovery that followed the spring shutdown accelerated far faster than any typical recession that economists like Schaufele had seen before, he said.

“That injection of the Cares Act stopped what we call contagion, so the impact of the recession did not spread outside of the industries it directly affected,” Schaufele said. “I’ve never seen that in my lifetime. The recessions I’ve seen have always leaked out into the broader economy.”

AD

In addition to the direct federal aid sent to Maryland, Schaufele estimated the cumulative value of expanded unemployment payments, stimulus checks and other federal spending tied to rescue efforts amounts to $50 billion pumped into the state’s economy.

AD

State officials were quick to point out that the government’s healthy balance sheets don’t mirror those of tens of thousands of Maryland families who have endured record unemployment, hunger and job losses concentrated among lower-paying industries.

The state’s $1 billion stimulus package, passed this year and paid for with federal aid, creates the nation’s most generous cash assistance program for the working poor and expands it to include undocumented residents who file taxes without using a Social Security number. Food banks, nonprofits, small businesses and middle- to low-income people on unemployment also received relief.

AD

“We managed to take care of the people who are most vulnerable, who are still suffering in this pandemic, which are many people,” McIntosh said in an interview this week. “We can actually see our way out of this pandemic over the course of not one, but two or three years.”

AD

Other parts of the budget fully fund higher education and an expansion of school revisions that pay for tutors. Budget experts expect the state to post a financial surplus for the next two years.

Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said in a statement that the budget reflects a willingness to make cuts when necessary and save money where possible.",2021-04-02 00:00:00

The work guided her and her mostly Chinese-speaking readers through heartbreak, divorce, struggles over identity and belonging, and questions of sex, sexism, friendship and family.

D.C. residents can shop in retail establishments and get haircuts and manicures as long as they wear masks when possible and the businesses follow various restrictions on crowd size and cleaning procedures. Non-essential retail businesses are limited to 25 percent capacity or 250 people, whichever is fewer. Indoor group fitness classes can operate with up to 10 people in addition to the trainer, while outdoor group fitness classes can operate up to 50 people, in addition to the trainer. Fitness centers are limited to 25 percent capacity or 250 people, whichever is fewer. Playgrounds are open. Child care centers can operate with the same child to staff ratios as before the pandemic.

Libraries can reopen at 25 percent capacity, with no more than 250 people inside at any time — whichever is fewer. Movie theaters can operate with up to 25 people in an auditorium and 25 percent capacity cap.

Are there enough hospital beds in the District?

Daily hospital bed statistics can be found here.

Have any variants of the virus been found in the District?

Yes. On Feb. 11, Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt announced that the variants first discovered in the United Kingdom and in South Africa have been found in the city for the first time. Three people were confirmed to have the variant from the U.K., and one was confirmed to have the variant from South Africa.

How can I get tested for the virus?

Many of the tests conducted in the District each day happen at private doctor’s offices, so if you have a primary care provider, calling your doctor is the best first step.

AD

AD

If you are looking for a free public testing location, the District offers tests every weekday and some weekends at firehouses and other walk-up and drive-through sites throughout the city. Check here to find out which testing sites are open on the day you are interested in visiting.

Can I travel in and out of the city?

Yes. The District relaxed the rules for out-of-state travel. If you travel to another state, you are required to quarantine at your home upon returning until you can get a negative coronavirus test, generally three to five days after your trip. If you prefer not to get tested for the coronavirus, you should stay home for two weeks after traveling. Those who are fully vaccinated and have waited 14 days after their final dose are not required to quarantine after they travel out of the D.C. region as long as it’s been within 90 days of the last dose.

AD

AD

If you want to host visitors from outside the D.C. region, the District’s rules require that your guests get a negative coronavirus test at home before they come here, and if they are staying for longer than three days, that they again get tested while they are in the District. They can use the city’s public testing sites free.

Is it safe to travel by airplane, train or bus?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that people avoid travel if it’s not necessary. As CDC epidemiologist Allison Walker says: “There’s really no such thing as safe travel.”

Experts debate about the precise risk of air travel. While the rates of infection linked to flying are relatively low, that low number is much more attributable to the lack of contact tracing to prove whether someone caught the virus on a plane or somewhere else, rather than the effectiveness of the ventilation systems on airplanes, researchers say.

AD

AD

That said, trains and buses do not have the same high-tech ventilation systems as planes. If you can drive in your personal car, rather than take a bus with others, consider that option instead. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a public health order requiring masks to be worn on planes and trains, train and subway stations, bus terminals and airports throughout the country.

Are D.C. schools holding classes in person?

Yes. On Tuesday, Feb. 2, students and teachers returned to in-person learning at D.C. public schools. The school system had expected more than 9,000 of its 52,000 students to return to classrooms that day, but attendance was much lower, in part because of a two-hour delay for snow. The majority of charter school students remain in virtual learning.

Various safety measures have been put in place for returning students, including grouping them in cohorts of no more than 11 people and requiring masks and social distancing. Many teachers remain opposed to returning to the classroom in person; Washington teachers union President Elizabeth Davis has told her members to show up for class if they can, and that the union would closely watch any safety complaints teachers made.

Do I have to wear a mask in public in the District?

Yes. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) strengthened the mask requirement in July, requiring everyone over the age of 2 to wear a mask in all businesses, in offices where any other people are working, in taxis or public transit vehicles, in common spaces in apartment buildings and in crowded outdoor settings. “Persons leaving their residences shall wear a mask when they are likely to come into contact with another person, such as being within six feet of another person for more than a fleeting time,” the order says.

Is it safe to eat in a restaurant, go shopping, hit the gym or attend a religious service?

Public health experts say any indoor spaces have higher transmission risks than being outdoors. Masking, social distancing and limited capacity can reduce the risk of transmission indoors, but it cannot eliminate it.

AD

AD

The CDC recommends not visiting any of these places if you are feeling ill and to check in advance about mask policies.

Is it safe to eat in a tent outdoors at a restaurant?

The risk of transmission depends on who else is in the tent with you. If it’s a pod limited to only the diners in your household, your transmission risk is less than if multiple tables are seated inside the same sealed tent. Although outdoors, if the tent is closed off to the elements it could create poor ventilation akin to dining indoors. Experts recommend wearing your mask whenever not actively eating and drinking.

How is the city distributing vaccines?

The District is vaccinating residents 65 and older, people 16 or older with serious health problems, such as cancer, diabetes or kidney or liver disease, people and staffers in congregate settings such as group homes and homeless shelters, and many groups of essential workers, including firefighters, police officers, health-care workers, teachers and grocery store workers. Children’s National opened a waitlist for 16- and 17-year-olds with medical conditions who qualify for the vaccine. Only 200 spots will be available on the waitlist at a time; Diana Troese, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said new spots may open daily.

AD

AD

Residents who qualify can sign up for appointments at vaccinate.dc.gov or can call 855-363-0333 to make an appointment by phone.

Starting in March, the city began an entirely different system based on preregistration. District residents sign up for the new system either online or by phone, providing their age, health conditions, work role and Zip code. The health department will process the requests and send each person an email or text message or call them when it is their turn to sign up for a vaccine appointment. The system will continue prioritizing residents of certain Zip codes.

Senior citizens and people with qualifying health conditions in the District can also make a vaccine appointment through numerous health systems and nonprofit clinics, including Howard University, Sibley and George Washington University health systems; you can find links to those clinics’ registration pages here.

Yes. Variants first identified in South Africa and the United Kingdom have been found in the state. A couple from Anne Arundel County was found to have the variant first found in the U.K. in mid-January. On Jan. 30, Hogan announced that a man in the Baltimore area was found to have the B.1.351 variant, a highly transmissible mutation of the coronavirus first found in South Africa. The man had not traveled out of the country, meaning that “community transmission” of the variant was likely, according to Hogan’s statement. On Feb. 2, Hogan said two Montgomery County residents who recently traveled abroad also tested positive for the same variant. And on Feb. 19, an inmate at the Jessup Correctional Facility was found to have the variant first found in the U.K.

Schools in Montgomery County, the state’s largest school system, welcomed back more than 19,000 children from kindergarten to third grade on March 15. Some children enrolled in special education and career programs and seniors who have grades so low they may not graduate, also returned to in-person instruction. At the beginning of March, more than 700 students had returned to classes — mostly special education and career program students. Public schools in Prince George’s County, the state’s second-largest school system, will reopen for in-class learning in April.

Do I have to wear a mask in public in Maryland?

Do I have to wear a mask in public in Virginia?

Those who are 5 and older must wear masks when indoors in areas shared with other people as well as outdoors if they are within six feet of another person.

Exemptions include eating or drinking in restaurants or taverns, exercising, a person seeking to communicate with a hearing-impaired person and anyone with a health condition that keeps them from wearing a face covering. Children older than 2 are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering when possible.

Employees inside essential business, such as a pharmacy or a restaurant, are also required to wear face coverings.

Violations of the mask order are considered a Class 1 misdemeanor and are subject to jail time and fines of as much as $2,500. The state has begun to penalize local businesses that violate the requirement by suspending food permits and other business licenses.

How is Virginia distributing the vaccine?

The state’s vaccination process has been hampered by confusion after the pool of eligible recipients was expanded under what turned out to be a false expectation that the federal government would be providing those extra doses. The state’s rate of inoculations briefly ranked near the bottom in the country before a push by Northam’s administration brought that rate up to where most states are.

AD

AD

Virginia has created a statewide registration system for residents to register for vaccine appointments. Residents can also call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA to register. However, since Fairfax County has opted out of the state system, residents of that county must continue to register for appointments here. And those seeking to get vaccinated through CVS must still register through that pharmacy’s website, which is not connected with the statewide system. Commercial pharmacies are starting to administer doses t0 a wider range of people: those aged 16 to 64 with high-risk medical conditions, as well as front-line essential workers, including police officers, mail carriers, public transit workers and ride-share drivers.

Health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities were first to get the vaccine. Virginia is now offering doses to residents 65 and older along with some essential workers including health-care workers, teachers, firefighters, police officers and child-care workers, though the supply of doses for people in some of these categories is limited in certain jurisdictions.

Nearly $40 million in federal Cares Act funds will go toward helping people who are uninsured or underinsured receive vaccines. Local health officials will be tasked with getting the vaccine to any non-federally recognized tribal communities.

Swahili Village restaurant review: A taste of African fine dining comes to D.C.,"Unfortunately, most of his intended audience — employees at the nearby International Monetary Fund, State Department, World Bank and foreign embassies — was working remotely. Making matters worse, Swahili Village would have had to open a month earlier to qualify for federal government assistance.

AD

“Very scary times,” says the self-trained chef, 53, who grew up in the town of Homa Bay on the shores of Lake Victoria. “But I’m very hopeful.”

Nyama choma is one of the dishes that could save Swahili Village, a spinoff of the more casual restaurant of the same name in Beltsville. Eaten throughout Kenya, nyama choma stars chunks of chargrilled beef or goat that have been marinated in a spice blend whose ingredients list goes on and on, like the Nile. We’re talking coriander, turmeric, ginger, cumin, paprika, methi seeds (fenugreek) but also cornstarch, sugar and MSG. It’s a mouthful. Also wonderful and wicked.

AD

Then again, the hospitality is a good case for extending the life of the African newcomer, too. Ethiopian food is a familiar sight in the area. Kenyan food less so. One of the first things you’ll be asked is if you know the cuisine, which the young staff is thrilled to describe if you ask. Onyona has his servers watch how each dish is made before they hit the floor, a requirement that helps them address any questions. If you haven’t had it before, you might not think to add a side dish of ugali, a white block of cornmeal mash, to your order. Kenyans wouldn’t think of eating a meal without it.

AD

“Ugali doesn’t ride its own wave,” says a server, who compares the staple to tofu, in that ugali absorbs the flavor of whatever it touches. Some diners mold a bit into a utensil for scooping up other food. Like charred beef and goat, ugali is eaten across Africa, albeit under different names. (West Africans know it as fufu.)

The appetizer sampler, including potato slices dipped in lentil batter and fried to golden, gives you an appreciation for how Kenyan cuisine has been shaped by India, Portugal, Britain and elsewhere. The sight of a fat samosa sets the mouth up for Indian accents, peas and potatoes. Instead, the hot shell cracks to reveal a stuffing of ground beef and herbs. The stubby sausages, meanwhile, are straight off an English breakfast table. Kenya was a British colony from 1920 to 1963. “We grew up on English bangers,” says Onyona. The trio of snacks comes with a comet of sweet Thai chile sauce on the plate, one of the restaurant’s non-African flourishes.

A server might suggest with your meal a little thimble of what looks like liquid fire: pili pili, a habanero-stoked condiment and an exception to Kenya’s relatively tame flavor profile. Whatever it touches, it torches. I love it. So do West Africans, Onyona tells me.

Onyona refers to goat as his countrymen’s go-to meat. One of the prizes on his menu is mbuzi mchuzi, chopped goat cooked low and slow with onions and garlic, rendering the meat tender. A gravy flavored with curry and bell peppers fills the mouth with warm spices.

AD

AD

Onyona, who came to the United States in 1999, studied to be a priest, but he says his true calling was cooking. A sense of his passion unfolds when he talks about watching his grandmother make something wonderful from not much more than water, onions, salt and fresh fish thrown into a clay pot.

He was mesmerized by the way she moved the wood around in the fire, so that the fish never overcooked or fell apart. The young Onyona was content just devouring the intense broth. His fondness for fish surfaces in whole fried tilapia, its steaming white flesh complemented by a curtain of masala sauce mixed with coconut milk and finished with fresh cilantro. (The love-it-or-hate-it herb makes frequent appearances among the entrees.)

You don’t need to eat meat to tap into a treasure. Lentils cooked to softness with onions and garlic and added to a masala sauce along with diced tomatoes and bell peppers are as hearty a pleasure as any here. The stew gets finished with coconut milk, a lovely binder.

The food is distinctive not just for the beautiful interplay of spices, but for the fact that each dish is prepared to order. The consistency — be it takeout or on the patio — comes courtesy of chef de cuisine Alfredo Hernandez, 42, who previously cooked at the original Swahili Village.

AD

AD

Main courses are outfitted with a choice of two sides. Each has something to recommend it, but the escorts I tend to lean on are collard greens and basmati rice. The vibrant greens are shredded into thin streamers and seasoned with not much more than caramelized onions before they’re lightly warmed in oil. What makes them the best for miles around turns out to be the unseen addition of chicken fat in their warm-up. The fluffy rice benefits from fried onions and garlic, but also cinnamon and black peppercorns, most of which are crushed so only their punch remains.

Like ugali, chapati is a useful tool for sponging sauces. The unleavened flatbread, scorched from the skillet, is similar to Indian roti, if a bit heavier. Other side dish options include fine-cut sauteed cabbage, dense and delicious fried plantains, and a creamed spinach any steakhouse would be happy to claim. Coconut milk binds the version at Swahili Village.

Colorful and boozy, the drinks look like they’ve been plucked from a Carnival cruise. One of the showiest is a margarita set aflame in the bar, a spectacle that probably works best if you’re seated in the underground restaurant. By the time our liquid floor show was ferried up the steep stairs and onto the front patio, only a shimmer of blue fire remained. Kudos, though, to the guide who delivered it to the table without spilling a drop.

AD

AD

I’ll be frank: The drinks list could use an upgrade. For now, your best bet is to wash a meal back with a Tusker lager from Kenya.

Diners of a certain vintage might remember Wazuri, the long-gone Dupont Circle restaurant that promised — and delivered — “A Taste of Africa” in the early 2000s. I can close my eyes and conjure owner Kojo Davis, sporting his trademark African cap and tunic, and smile at the memory of fetri, seemingly the distillation of dozens of mothers’ cures for homesickness, brimming with corn, tomato and okra, as well as diced chicken and lamb.

While its focus is more narrow, the more formal Swahili Village is picking up where Wazuri left off. Onyona hired an African architect from New York to rethink the space. When I went inside the vast dining room to announce my party, I caught a glimpse of handsome paintings of a herd of elephants here and a wildebeest migration there. The owner has nicknamed his 295-seat restaurant “the Consulate,” a nod to the embassy personnel he still hopes to attract.

AD

AD

Next up: a Swahili Village for Newark, with great support from the brand builder’s landlord. Onyona expects to open there by September.

First things first, though. The Washington restaurant, which recently grew its menu to include lamb, red snapper and jollof rice, would look even better with more people in it.

After my last meal, I asked our fervent server to pack up leftovers, because no way am I going to leave any collard greens or goat stew behind. He returned with a bag and a request: “Tell everyone you know!”

Done!

Rusty Lyman’s II: Rusty’s Revenge: Last April, the owners of Lyman’s Tavern missed Dewey Beach bars and their favorite beach cocktails so much that they purchased a juicer to make fresh-squeezed Orange and Grapefruit Crushes and a blender to whip up daiquiris. They turned Lyman’s — then carryout-only — into a pseudo-beach bar called Rusty Lyman’s. (The name was inspired by Dewey’s infamous Rusty Rudder.) Rusty’s returns to the 16th Street Heights bar this month for Rusty Lyman’s II: Rusty’s Revenge, with new food and drink menus for the patio. If you wish sunny May beach days would hurry up already, this is the place to go. 4 p.m. to midnight.

"Following pandemic, converting office buildings into housing may become new ‘normal’","This could be a problem-solving opportunity in the future if excess commercial office space can be converted into housing, with some being affordable. But accomplishing conversion feasibly has challenges in design, technology, regulations, and costs and financing.

The pandemic has revealed that, whether by necessity or choice, some people can work productively and collaboratively yet without being in the same space. This possibility was predicted years ago by real estate developer Jay Hellman, who dubbed it “virtual adjacency.”

AD

Internet-based communication technologies enable an individual, sitting at her or his personal computer, to interact with other individuals; host or attend meetings involving scores of people; make or observe visual presentations; and listen to lectures or participate in webinars. American firms and organizations now realize that many of their employees need to be in the office only part of the week, working at “hot desks” shared with other employees on other days.

Reduced demand for leased office space will reduce an office building’s market value, which depends entirely on leasing revenue. For office building owners, equity investors and lenders, this is disastrous, prospectively a path to insolvency and foreclosures.

Especially vulnerable are aging, deteriorating or functionally and technologically obsolete office buildings; buildings in overbuilt areas or neighborhoods with falling real estate values and rising vacancy rates; and buildings far from public transit. Yet often, the existing structural bones, and sometimes the skins and roofs of such buildings, can be saved and repurposed for housing.

AD

AD

Some buildings could even be adapted to a mixed-use conversion approach, with one portion of a building preserved for offices and residential units occupying the remaining portion. But no matter which conversion strategy is pursued, significant hurdles must be overcome.

Design and technical hurdles stem from geometric differences between what works architecturally for an office building vs. an apartment building. Office building floor plates are typically large and deep to provide layout and partitioning flexibility, with sizable dimensions between exterior walls and central circulation cores.

By contrast, multistory apartment buildings are proportioned to enable living/dining rooms and bedrooms to abut window walls. The length of a conventional, rectangular apartment building with units on both sides of a corridor can be whatever the building site allows, even hundreds of feet. But the building width is typically 60 to 65 feet. Kitchens, bathrooms, closets, utility rooms and, for two-level units, interior stairs abut windowless corridor walls.

AD

AD

Because much office building square footage is far from exterior walls, conversion to housing may require modifying the basic building structure. For example, parts of the roof and floor plates on upper levels might be cut open to create interior, skylit, mini-courtyards to bring light into habitable and interior rooms. And unique apartment layouts are often needed to effectively use available floor space.

Additional structural surgery provides vertically aligned floor openings for stairways and fire-protected exits, elevators shafts and chases accommodating plumbing and HVAC ductwork. Also, new roofing, windows, exterior cladding and insulation are usually necessary.

Fortunately, office building floor-to-floor dimensions typically exceed apartment building floor-to-floor dimensions. This is aesthetically and technically beneficial for housing conversion. Increased room heights augment the sense of space and openness while allowing natural light to penetrate farther into the apartment. And the extra dimension enables provision of space between the hung apartment ceiling and floor structure above for sprinkler pipes, electrical conduits, light fixtures and air ducts.

Zoning regulations and building code constraints add another hurdle for office-to-housing conversion. Requirements concerning fire and smoke protection, egress paths of travel, access to natural light and ventilation, and occupancy are written for conventional buildings. Yet building conversions are never conventional, making variances, special exceptions or even regulatory amendments a necessity.

AD

AD

Every aspect of conversion work described above entails great expense, to which must be added the underlying acquisition cost and market value of the basic building structure and land on which it sits. So saving money is not the predominant justification for converting office buildings to housing.

Rather, conversion accomplishes worthy social and environmental goals while providing office building owners the possibility of staying financially solvent.

Thus, the most daunting office-to-housing conversion hurdle is financing to cover the array of costs. Private sector equity and debt financing sources exist to finance market-rate housing units.

But subsidy funds for affordable, below-market-rate units must come from public sector sources: the federal government; state and local governments; and nonprofit housing trusts. This is why subsidy financing for converting office buildings to housing will be the greatest challenge by far.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
A Logan Circle condo has unusual access to its roof deck,"The wing was built in 2017 on the garden lot next to the original 1887 house and was joined with it to form a U-shaped building. Although the exterior mimics the older home and maintains the look of D.C.’s Logan Circle historic district, the interior goes in a different direction.

“This side was always intended to be modern and very open,” said architect Michael Beidler of Trout Design Studio, who worked on the project with the developer, Matt Shkor of Potomac Construction Group.

The apartment is spacious, with two levels inside and one outside. It has three bedrooms, each with an en suite bathroom. In addition to a main living area with a gas fireplace, it has a family room on the second level. The approximately 800-square-foot private roof deck, which is on the third (outside) level, has views of the Washington Monument. The unit also has direct elevator access and garage parking for two cars.

AD

AD

But what sets it apart is the glass box that encases the stairs to the roof deck. As it turns out, the glass box wasn’t in the original plans for roof access, which went through several iterations.

“When we designed the building initially, there was a spiral staircase that went from this level, this unit, down to the ground,” Beidler said. “It was going to be quicker access to get them down to their parking space.”

But the fire department balked at the spiral staircase and made the developer remove it from this unit down to the lower levels while allowing it to remain to access the roof deck.

“You went out a single door, out to a landing, and up the spiral staircase on the back of the building, which was terrifying,” Beidler said.

AD

Because the buyer wasn’t keen on the exposed staircase, Beidler proposed a solution.

AD

“I said, ‘Why don’t we put a glass box on the back of the house, and then you have a comfortable enclosed way to get up there,’ ” he said.

After receiving approval from the historic district, a glass box was added around the spiral staircase. But then the deal between that buyer and the developer fell through. The new buyer didn’t want the spiral staircase and wanted more light from outdoors to come into the unit.

“I said no problem we can put a real staircase in there,” Beidler said.

Now a steel structure forms the spine of the stairs, and the mahogany-clad steps cantilever off that spine.

AD

“The steel treads are encased in wood to give it a much softer appeal,” Beidler said. “Then we put lighting under the treads and put a glass partition in the center. That stainless-steel railing that goes up ties to the stainless-steel railing that’s inside” the unit.

AD

Not only do the glass and steel echo the finishes inside the apartment, but the mahogany is also in sympathy with the roof deck.

“The upper deck material comes down through that staircase,” he said. “When you are in the second floor of that unit and you look through, it gives you just a hint of what is coming upstairs.”

Beidler also added large glass folding doors to the stairs that allow natural light to flood the space.

AD

“That staircase is so beautiful, when the doors are open, it’s really part of the living space that goes up to the roof deck,” he said. “There is a retractable glass roof on top that protects it from the weather.”

On the roof, the mahogany deck had to be reinforced to withstand the weight of the absolute black marble countertop, with a leather finish, on the island and cooking area. A steel structure holds in place sails that provide shade.

“The sails, they can handle 120-mph winds,” Beidler said. “We’re high enough to get over the rooftops of a lot of the buildings on Logan Circle, so you’ve got a great view of the Mall from the top deck.”

Even though the stairs ended up being nothing like what he first designed them to be, Beidler said he is more than pleased with how they turned out.

AD

AD

“When you are in the unit and the doors are open and you have that staircase beckoning to you to come up the stairs, it’s such a lovely moment because that stair is really sculptural,” he said. “We were able to create this piece of sculpture for the apartment that’s this beautiful functional thing.”

The three-bedroom, four-bathroom, 2,578-square-foot condo is listed at just under $2.7 million.

QAnon’s Unexpected Roots in New Age Spirituality,"I didn’t choose New Age culture. But I grew up in a college town in Northern California in the 1980s, where the ubiquitous Grateful Dead stickers, crystal shops and tarot card readers suggested that the 1960s ethos of self-discovery never ended. Psychedelic accoutrements and people who self-identified as seekers were normal to me — and so I craved mainstream American culture. I rebelled — mildly — by eating Domino’s pizza at sleepovers and idolizing the nihilism of 1970s punk.

It turns out that I didn’t entirely resist it. In the past decade or so, my fluency in the world of New Age culture, wellness, woo-woo (whatever you might call it) became a professional boon as a journalist. These ideas were taking off once again, especially among women who are White and middle-class, which I also am. I understood that world and had a lot to say about it. While on assignment I’ve gone to menstrual huts and tea ceremonies; I’ve gotten massaged by boa constrictors and I’ve meditated at sound baths. I’ve greeted this all with professional curiosity, something between an open mind and a world-weary arched eyebrow.

On Jan. 6, along with the rest of the country, I followed the news of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the prominence of Confederate flags, nooses and other symbols of the far right. Like many others, I took note of the so-called QAnon Shaman: 33-year-old Jake Angeli, born Jacob Anthony Chansley, of Arizona. He was bare-chested and covered in Nordic tattoos, at least one of which, the Valknot, is a Norse symbol sometimes associated with white supremacy. But he was also, infamously, wearing a headdress fashioned from buffalo horns and coyote skin — elements associated with the American West that seemed to telegraph a pagan spirituality. I’ve been around a lot of White people who have adopted a mishmash of pagan and Indigenous signifiers as a New Age aesthetic. It’s a cringeworthy and offensive display of appropriation that I don’t endorse, but it’s common in that world.

After the attack on the Capitol, news reports unearthed that Chansley was a founder of something called the Star Seed Academy (in a certain New Age vernacular, a star seed is a higher being). The Facebook page for the venture, before it was taken down, read: “Star Seed Academy creates leaders of the highest order! We help people to awaken, evolve and ascend! Are you ready to be a leader? Are you ready to ascend?” Recently, Chansley’s lawyer, Albert Watkins, told me in a statement that his client “is deeply spiritual. His spirituality is serving him well as he traverses the pending federal charges.” He added that Chansley has “a personal commitment to Ahimsa,” the principle (found in Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism) of doing no harm.

As a devotee of QAnon — the sprawling set of false claims that have coalesced into an extremist ideology deemed a domestic terrorist threat by the FBI — and a freedom fighter for Donald Trump, Chansley was my ideological opposite; yet there was also a lot about him that was familiar. It felt shocking and suggested serious flaws in a culture I thought I understood: a fine line between the kind of zeitgeist-y, sensitive New Age-guy version of masculinity, and something more nefarious. The idea of spiritual lineage is too generous to bestow on Chansley, but he represents a growing pipeline between New Age male spirituality, new masculinity movements and QAnon. This pipeline is one of unlikely connections and strange bedfellows, of mixed martial arts fighters and poets, evangelical Christians and yoga teachers.

In 2009, Charlotte Ward, an independent researcher on alternative spirituality — religious beliefs outside of conventional groups — began to notice a hybrid of conspiracy theory beliefs and New Age culture cropping up online. Two years later, she co-wrote a paper titled “The Emergence of Conspirituality” in the Journal of Contemporary Religion. She and co-writer David Voas, a quantitative social scientist at University College London, noted an emphasis on patterns and connections in both conspiracy culture and alternative spiritual beliefs. Nothing is as it seems, and nothing is an accident. “These worldviews make public and personal life respectively seem less subject to random forces and therein lies part of their appeal,” they wrote.

Ward and Voas defined “conspirituality” as a “politico-spiritual philosophy based on two core convictions” — one core to conspiracy theories and the other rooted in New Age belief systems: “1) a secret group covertly controls, or is trying to control, the political and social order, and 2) humanity is undergoing a ‘paradigm shift’ in consciousness. Proponents believe that the best strategy for dealing with the threat of a totalitarian ‘new world order’ is to act in accordance with an awakened ‘new paradigm’ worldview.”

In our cultural moment, when baseless claims about both a rigged election and the dangers of vaccines hit Americans almost simultaneously, there has been renewed interest in Ward and Voas’s decade-old paper and, specifically, the idea of conspirituality. (During the week I interviewed Voas, he had three other similar interviews lined up.) With the image of Chansley in animal horns and fur leading an attack on the Capitol, conspirituality was more than an idea in an academic paper or on the Internet. It had become our shared reality.

When I was about 10 years old, my mother became interested in the idea of the divine feminine, specifically centering spirituality on women rather than the patriarchal notion of a male god. She had never shown interest in spirituality before but dived in with, well, a religious fervor. She took me to a screening of the 1989 Canadian documentary “Goddess Remembered,” about goddess worship in ancient European culture and its potential as a renewed spiritual movement. Judging from the attendees of the goddess fairs in hotel ballrooms I was also taken to, this was a fairly White, progressive and privileged group of women. It served as a kind of spiritual extension of the women’s liberation movement of the 1970s, parallel to feminism.

Men soon started to realize that they, too, had a gender to consider, and the men’s movement took off in the ’70s and ’80s. It manifested in three expressions, says Cliff Leek, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Northern Colorado and vice president of the American Men’s Studies Association: “You get pro-feminist [men’s] groups that do work around reproductive health and sexual violence; and, on the other end of the spectrum, men’s rights groups that say, ‘We are gendered and the system is out to get us.’ The middle way is the mythopoetic: tying masculinity back to the sacred and mythological.”

The prevailing figure in the mythopoetic movement is the poet Robert Bly. In 1990, Bly, who was in his 60s (he’s now 94), published “Iron John: A Book About Men,” which includes lines like, “Where a man’s wound is, that is where his genius will be.” Bly’s idea, told through Jung-influenced archetypes and fairy tales, was that men had been robbed of true masculinity via emotionally withholding fathers who raised soft sons. With some reflection — and maybe some banging on drums with other dudes in the forest — they could reclaim their inner Zeuses and thrive. The book was sometimes the butt of jokes, but spent over a year on the New York Times bestseller list. It was so popular and so part of the New Age canon that I bought a copy as a teenager. I thought it seemed a bit corny, like the kind of thing long-haired aging hippie dads of my friends might enjoy. But I read it because I knew it was an element of a cultural conversation that I wanted to be a part of.

The spirit of “Iron John” can still be found in mythopoetic men’s groups. Take, for example, The Embodied Men’s Leadership Training, a program that offers retreats and coaching. (A representative of the company declined to comment for this article.) The retreats promise a lot. “In this meticulously held circle of men, you will be both met with compassion and called to deepen,” one description reads, accompanied by images of mostly White men patting each other on the shoulder or sitting atop rocks. “Your embodied presence will expand, your relationship to consciousness will deepen, and the sword of your integrity will sharpen. You will be challenged, nourished, and given the tools and brotherhood you wish you had found years ago.” Sounds enriching, but the wording around a related program for women has a distinctly anti-feminist flair: “Women, we’ve reached a point in history in which many of you are equalling and surpassing men in earning, personal growth and spiritual capacity. ... And yet, there is a longing deep in your heart for something more.”

“As soon as we tie masculinity to spirituality, we turn masculinity into something ‘sacred’ as well as distinct and exclusive of women,” says Leek. “I’m not entirely sure that is something that can be done in a way that doesn’t reinforce or naturalize inequalities.” These retreats seem to be encouraging strong behavior from a group — White, ruling-class men — who are already the most privileged in our society. But you also see this core message about strong men in socially conservative packaging. There’s a fear of women getting too powerful and a veneration of the housewife that, frankly, reminds me of the Proud Boys, the alt-right group with a history of violence that believes women are best left at home raising children.

“The wellness and spirituality world is very parallel to the evangelical Christian world, especially when it comes to the messaging around masculinity,” Leek explains. “The mythopoetic aspect of the men’s movement is very much rooted in patriarchal notions of chivalry and men as protectors and warriors. Evangelical masculinity is basically identical.” He wasn’t surprised to see the QAnon Shaman beside evangelical groups at the Capitol. QAnon, with its fixation on pedophilic conspiracies led by Hollywood and the liberal elite, can give a certain kind of man in search of purpose a way to feel like a literal protector.

Last year, Matthew Remski, a writer and co-host of the “Conspirituality” podcast, was reporting a story on QAnon for the Canadian magazine the Walrus, and he interviewed Lamont Daigle, founder of a Canadian QAnon spinoff group. During the interview, Remski noted to Daigle that he talked about his political journey as if it were a spiritual journey. Daigle responded, Remski told me recently, that it all started with “Iron John.”

I emailed Daigle to ask how “Iron John” had influenced him. He wrote back praising the book’s view of pre-industrial history, including the tradition of fathers passing down a trade to their sons. “ ‘Apprenticeship’ was lost and is/was key for bonding,” Daigle wrote. “As ‘Iron John’ was suggesting, the love unit most damaged by the industrial revolution has been the father-son bond.” His view of society today is much darker: “From what I’ve seen on the streets and stage of this New World Order agenda in the last year, fierce protective men have been noticeably absent, and the women are standing up stronger and more vocal.”

All of which fits with Remski’s analysis of this subculture. “There’s a kind of iconographic romance between swole but New Agey male figures who are taking supplements and staying disciplined, and women who have deep connections to the divine,” he says. “There’s a righteous and holy and sacralized sexuality, an immunological radiance around the holy couple.” I know exactly the type of couples he’s talking about. I see them on Instagram espousing the know-your-strength relationship consciousness taught at the Embodied Masculine retreats, and in the vulnerable but divine masculinity of “Iron John.”

I think of the macho wellness dude as epitomized by the comedian-turned-podcaster Joe Rogan, who sells mugs and tube socks that read “conquer your inner b----” and Hindu-deity-inspired T-shirt designs. (I reached out to Rogan, but his representative did not respond.) Then there is the pandemic-era bro upgrade to the mythopoetic archetype — which is how you find MMA fighters like Tim Kennedy on the podcast of comedian JP Sears, with both men arguing that we’ve overreacted to covid.

A vast landscape of lost people — who need a belief system to guide their actions — constitutes promising terrain for someone seeking to attract believers, proteges or followers (online or otherwise). The central figures in this subculture “are guys who don’t know how to manage their charisma,” says Remski. “They are burdened with unwarranted confidence amplified and recycled by social media until it’s habitual but also viral.”

Jules Evans, an honorary research fellow at the Center for the History of Emotions at Queen Mary University of London, has investigated the history, philosophy and psychology of well-being. In an article for Medium called “Nazi Hippies: When the New Age and Far Right Overlap,” Evans wrote about how leading members of the Nazi party in the 1930s and ’40s were followers of alternative spirituality and medicine. “There was an idea that western culture has lost its way and we need to return to traditional sources of wisdom, whether that be Hinduism or Sufism or traditional gender roles,” Evans told me. It’s a concept that’s popular today with the alt-right. “There is an overlap,” he says, “between New Age and far-right populism in traditionalist thinking, that the West has lost its way with feminism, multiculturalism, egalitarianism, and we need a return to order.”

In December, an NPR/Ipsos poll asked respondents whether they believe the myth behind QAnon: that “a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media.” Seventeen percent said it was true, and 37 percent said they didn’t know. It would be easy to write this off as simply a mass lack of critical-thinking ability — and that is certainly part of it — but when Jeffrey Epstein, whose friends were some of the most powerful people in the world, was charged with sex trafficking involving underage girls, it’s easy to see how someone might be tempted to blur the line between real-life corruption and conspiracy theories.

“Conspiracy theories are going to attach to how we already see the world,” says Joseph E. Uscinski, a professor of political science at the University of Miami who researches American conspiracy theories. They are representative of people’s concerns at the time: the Bavarian illuminati of the 18th century, the Freemasons in the 1930s, the JFK assassination in the 1960s.

I have a sense of how women in the wellness world can fall down these rabbit holes. Alternative spirituality “is related to issues that are thought to be of greater concern to women, such as self-care or connectedness,” Voas told me. “This is thought to be upbeat and optimistic in its orientation — which is a contrast to conspiracy theory, which is darker, more pessimistic, more political, about secret forces controlling things behind the scenes.” And yet, alternative spirituality and conspiracy are, in the end, united by a narcissistic idea: that there are things in the world crying out for explanation and that you alone are unraveling the truth. As Voas puts it, “The central point is that we have, in our society, competition between trust and doubt.”

An article last year in the European Journal of Social Psychology called “An exploration of spiritual superiority: The paradox of self‐enhancement,” by Dutch behavioral scientists Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser, found that “the road to spiritual enlightenment may yield the exact same mundane distortions that are all too familiar in social psychology, such as self‐enhancement, illusory superiority, closed‐mindedness, and hedonism (clinging to positive experiences) under the guise of alleged ‘higher’ values.” This spiritual form of narcissism reminds me of Chansley’s language on Facebook around star seeds. According to Evans, it’s derived, in a copy of a copy kind of way, from an idea in Gnosticism — a collection of beliefs from early Christian sects, popular in alternative spirituality, that there are spiritual aliens who are different species: “You are from another planet, you’ve fallen into this prison of the material world, and you’re working to ascend to your true home. It’s an extreme expression of spiritual alienation and spiritual narcissism.”

I am guessing Chansley probably wanted to achieve notoriety for his ideas — and that a desire to stand out is part of the reason he chose such a bizarre costume to wear to an attempted coup. He is, to use a term popular on the Internet, a spiritual version of a clout chaser.

But I don’t want to tease anyone for their spiritual ideas, even Chansley, who has been charged with six federal crimes and awaits trial. Rather, I’m interested in the larger question this raises about contemporary masculinity. What void is this filling? If QAnon provides an easy answer for a small but steady group of men, we should think about what a healthier spiritual alternative looks like. “Whatever it is, it should be offline for starters,” says Remski. “It could focus on community service, but at the very least it should be built in the neighborhood, not on the consumer workshop circuit. The last thing the ex-QAnon man needs is a leader or a group commodifying his recovery or monetizing his confessions or emotions.” Remski has already noticed a rise in men’s groups based on spiritual bodybuilding, sacred real estate and supplement pyramid schemes. “I guarantee,” he predicts, “that within the year a pair of bros will start up a [multilevel marketing business] that sells QAnon recovery products.”

Correction: An earlier version incorrectly identified the name of the men’s program that offers retreats and coaching. It is The Embodied Men’s Leadership Training, not Embodied Masculine.

"A Virginia mental institution for Black patients, opened after the Civil War, yields a trove of disturbing records","Little else is known about Stewart; the “remarks” section for his entry is blank. Nor do we know much about any of the tens of thousands of other Black patients who spent time at the hospital from its post-Civil War beginnings to the 1960s, when civil rights legislation forced state mental institutions to integrate. But researchers are beginning to uncover records like Stewart’s, long buried in the hospital’s storage rooms. Over the past decade, there has been an extraordinary effort to preserve and digitize these documents. While the records have thus far revealed little about individual patients, they have, in the aggregate, painted a disturbing picture of the facility’s past. And they say much about the history and oppression of institutionalized Black lives.

When the Civil War ended, Southern White health professionals believed they were facing a potential wave of Black patients. The contemporary racist thinking held that, without slavery, Black people would fall into illness and insanity. “Under the compulsive power of the white man,” influential physician Samuel A. Cartwright wrote in a 1851 article, “Report on the Diseases and Physical Peculiarities of the Negro Race,” “they are made to labor or exercise, which makes the lungs perform the duty of vitalizing the blood more perfectly than is done when they are left free to indulge in idleness.”

Virginia’s push to create an all-Black state asylum came out of this fear of Black madness, as well as the segregationist desire to house Black patients separately from White ones. Officially founded in 1869, the asylum at its inception committed 123 supposedly mentally ill patients and 100 who were poor or homeless and had nowhere else to go, many of them transferred from other state institutions.

There’s very little record of what it was truly like to be a patient at Central Lunatic Asylum. Many of the patients were illiterate — an outgrowth of the prohibition on reading among enslaved people — and the archives don’t include their writing anyway. And until recently, few of the records were available to researchers at all. The hospital — which exists today under the name Central State Hospital, in the town of Petersburg, about 25 miles south of Richmond — has been chronically underfunded and unable to protect its century-old files from deterioration. One historian who visited in 2003 describes watching in horror as a staff worker nearly tossed out a sheaf of papers in a cleanup effort.

In 2007, hospital administrators reached out to King Davis, a former mental health commissioner for Virginia and a professor of mental health policy at the University of Texas at Austin, with a plea to protect the archives. Davis quickly secured funding from the university and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors to begin what has become a more than decade-long project to preserve Central’s files. Since then, his team has digitized approximately 800,000 pages of documents, 10,000 photographs and hundreds of pages of negatives and slides about the hospital, among other records.

The documents and photos shed light on a painful history. Patients at Central in its first few decades lived in crowded and unsanitary conditions, subject to treatments that were anything but therapeutic, including experimental surgeries and forced sterilization. Because doctors believed that Black sanity depended on hard labor — and because that labor was free — patients were required to work at the hospital, tending its large farm or doing domestic chores such as laundry and cleaning. “Central really worked just to re-enslave the people who were there,” says Kirby Randolph, a professor of history and bioethics at the University of Kansas medical school who has studied the hospital’s early years.

Patients could be hospitalized for manias supposedly brought on by “religious excitement” or “freedom.” Women were committed because they were upset about their husband’s desertion, or because they had intense menstrual pain. People could be committed by a White employer or by others in the community, essentially on hearsay, with little chance to defend their sanity in court. Shelby Pumphrey, a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in African American history at Vassar College who has studied Central’s turn-of-the-century records closely, found only one reported instance of someone who avoided being committed once a process was initiated — and no one who committed themselves. Many patients attempted to escape, and many others, like Stewart, died of unrelated illnesses contracted in the hospital. Those who died were buried in unmarked graves, some of which may have been disturbed by grave robbers hunting for cadavers to be used at local medical colleges.

Some of these traumas were common among all patients in 19th-century mental institutions. But Davis has found that more Black patients than White ones were diagnosed at the time with some form of mania. “One of the reasons we got all these unusual diagnoses, particularly mania, had to do with perceptions of Black people, Black men, as being on the cusp always of violence and danger,” Davis told me. These misperceptions persist today. According to psychologist Arthur Whaley, who has studied race-based mental health inequities, Black people are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, to be hospitalized and to stay longer in hospitals than White people; once hospitalized, they’re more likely to be physically or chemically restrained. And when Black people resist arrest or hospitalization, their fear can be perceived as aggression, with sometimes devastating results.

“When African Americans respond or react to oppression, in an appropriate way, because those experiences are not shared by the mainstream, they’re seen as paranoid, and they’re misdiagnosed,” says Whaley, who does clinical work in Houston. The 19th century’s racist ideas around Black mental health — the notion that Black men are “on the cusp always of violence” — are still carried by some today, as evidenced by the disproportionate killings of Black men by law enforcement.

The papers at Central aren’t important just because of their relevance for today, of course — but that relevance certainly makes an urgent case for their preservation. “I don’t think we can fully appreciate where we are without understanding that past,” says Brandi Justice, Central’s acting director, who says she feels a strong responsibility toward the hospital’s former patients as well as its current ones.

And yet millions of pages, including treatment records that could offer vivid clarity on how patients were viewed and diagnosed, have yet to be digitized or preserved because of a lack of funding. In addition, the Library of Virginia has made a controversial decision to cut off researcher access to all state mental health records 125 years old or younger (previously, the number was 75), stymying crucial studies of Central’s history. In hopes of moving the project forward nonetheless, Davis is cheering on a bill recently introduced in the Virginia State Senate to allocate $150,000 to preservation efforts at Central. “You bring light to the system, to expose both its strengths as well as its weaknesses,” Davis says. “I think that’s how change starts to occur.”",2021-03-26 00:00:00
Pete Buttigieg: ‘A lot of the mistrust in our country right now is the result of policy failure.’,"At perhaps all stages of your journey, entering the presidential race and now, people have worried about your relative inexperience. South Bend is a small city with something like an 18-route bus network and an Amtrak stop. In taking on this massive [transportation] system, what experience translates, and what do you need to figure out?

So the truth is, it’s rare for a Cabinet secretary to have managed an organization as large as a federal agency in the past. And in that sense, I’m not different. And that’s where the phenomenal career staff here at the agency as well as a set of presidential appointees that support me are so important. But I would say that my experience has, I think, prepared me for this, precisely because it gives me the prism of dealing with this department from the perspective of a community that really needs that support.

AD

AD

It’s one thing if you’re a city that has multiple full-time federal-relations employees on staff. And some do. We sure didn’t. [Laughs.] And so I had that experience of trying to get your calls returned in Washington — and it’s part of what motivates me to make sure that we’re serving every kind of community. And while it’s certainly a different scale — I’m used to a budget in the hundreds of millions, and now I have one in the tens of billions — there is also something [similar] about taking the leadership of an agency with a lot of complex and diverse functions and very different kinds of people working within it and bringing a common culture and vision to that entity.

You seem to love new tech, innovation, like the smart sewers you implemented in South Bend. What is the coolest stuff that could be game-changing for transportation?

When it comes to driving, it’s AVs or EVs, automated vehicles and electric vehicles. But I actually think some of the most interesting things happening are around what’s called micromobility. Scooters — all of that. That’s still in its infancy and has enormous potential. Then you look at trains, right? We might be poised for the second great railroad revolution in this country. The first one is part of what made America America. The second one would involve higher speeds, better passenger resources. And then some of the further-out possibilities, like hyperloops and maglevs [magnetic levitation] that are, again, in their infancy but showing a lot of interesting possibilities. Then you got the aviation side, right? Jet planes, drones and commercial space travel. There’s no shortage of fascinating things.

AD

Now, let me mention one other exciting, deeply unsexy, profoundly important thing. Again, I’m looking out the window, and most of what I see that isn’t a building is some sort of pavement. One of the problems with asphalt is it creates runoff. There’s versions of it that are permeable. The water goes right through it. Total game changer.

The other thing I think is ahead that’s just as important and just as innovative is the social side — really understanding what transportation means for human beings. And this is where a lot of the most interesting questions in racial and economic justice are at stake. Is transportation about expanding opportunity? Or is it about preserving opportunity for some? And how do we make sure that a new investment in a neighborhood or a city doesn’t hurt somebody?

Your latest book is about trust. Can you talk about the ways that the idea of trust is guiding your decisions in your new role, in terms of rebuilding trust in government, trust in each other?

AD

AD

I think a lot of the mistrust in our country right now is the result of policy failure. And that policy failure is largely about a generation of intentional disinvestment in the things that we share and need together. So what’s so exciting about the moment we’re in is there’s a chance to change that. To make the investments that will lead to people seeing their government work for them and noticing it, feeling it. It’s a very specific and dollars-and-cents way to talk about something as deep and emotional as trust, but I think it’s profoundly important. And then doing it equitably. That’s how we make sure that we’re actually an instrument of greater, not lesser, trust across the dividing lines that fracture the foundation of American life.

Some of the best examples of unspoken assumptions about trust in our lives come from transportation. We feel it when we get on an airplane — the trust you’re placing in two people in front of that plane to shoot you through the atmosphere in a giant metal tube at almost the speed of sound and deliver you on land safely. But also every time you approach an intersection, your life depends on whether the other cars are obeying the traffic lights. Whether you can trust other drivers and trust the system to keep you safe. Now I’m a steward of that trust.

Just after leaving Afghanistan, where you served as a Naval Reserve officer, a fellow serviceman was killed by a roadside bomb along a route you might have been on yourself. How did that experience shape your outlook and trajectory?

AD

AD

It gives me an appreciation for the unjustifiable luck that explains why it was somebody else and not me. Why I came home and other people didn’t.

Some people think things happen for a reason. You would not agree?

No. How can I say that there was any better reason why a father didn’t make it home and a guy like me did? The only reasons are the ones we create after the fact. And that’s why I feel it as kind of a propulsion more than anything. The only way I figured out how to make good on that fortune is to do everything I can with my time I get to spend above the ground to make sure that my life, but also my country’s life, is worthy of the cost of securing it.

AD

I think a lot about the difference between workhorses and show horses and how to make sure, arriving in Washington, that I make it clear that I’m here to work and get results and be part of the team. Especially in a very functional role like delivering on American transportation after being in a campaign environment, where it’s inevitably a bit more about the show. This is the doing of all things that people talk about on the campaign trail. And so I’m very mindful of the need to just put my head down and deliver.",2021-03-26 00:00:00
"Barbara Pope was the Rosa Parks of D.C., but her story was mostly forgotten","Ann Chinn grew up hearing family stories that her grandmother’s sister Barbara Pope had been a published writer. But recollections were short on details; it was so long ago. Chinn, 74, only knew that her great-aunt wrote stories.

In fact, Barbara Pope, a D.C. native, ranks among the most stunning forgotten American lives. She was, in addition to being a high school teacher, an author of fiction about social change at the turn of the 20th century, and her literary voice was celebrated on the international stage by no less than W.E.B. Du Bois. Her stories probed relationships among men and women, Black and White, with a modern voice and a sharp eye for detail and character. In her story “The New Woman,” the main character is a smart, industrious and beautiful Black woman who asks her husband if she can clerk for him in his law office, as she did for her father. “The bargain was that you would practice law and I take charge of the home,” she tells him, “but neither of us must be selfish, and each will call on the other for assistance when needed.”

But perhaps her greatest accomplishment was the stand she took against racism in transportation nearly 50 years before Rosa Parks’s bus ride: In August 1906, Pope boarded a train at Union Station and traveled into Virginia, in the process challenging Virginia’s Jim Crow law requiring segregation on trains and streetcars. She soon gained the support of Du Bois and his Niagara Movement, a precursor to the NAACP. And her case became one of the first steps along the path to the end of legal segregation — leading the way toward the NAACP’s hallmark 1954 Supreme Court victory in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka.

Not long after her case, she left the public stage amid personal troubles and would become remembered mainly among scholars — more of a footnote in history than a history maker. Almost the only place you can find Pope’s work is in the Library of Congress on microfilm. In 2015, however, literary historian Jennifer Harris wrote a profile of Pope for Legacy, a journal of American women writers, that aimed to bring Pope back into the spotlight. Harris used her archivist investigator skills to unearth Pope’s fiction and seek out her story from surviving family members, including Chinn.

Chinn, who works as executive director of the nonprofit Middle Passage Ceremonies and Port Markers Project in Jacksonville, Fla., now draws a connection between the widespread protests following George Floyd’s death last year and the stand that Pope took more than a century ago. In both, Chinn says, “you’re seeing a movement and tactics and strategy in its formative stages.”

Ann Chinn, great-niece of Barbara Pope. (Bob Self for The Washington Post)

Pope was born in 1854 and grew up in a progressive family in Georgetown’s Black community. She began a teaching career in 1873 and taught for a year at Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee Institute. She also advocated for reforms in the District’s Colored School System.

In the 1890s, Pope, who never married, started publishing fiction. Du Bois included some of her stories in an exhibition he organized for the Paris Exposition of 1900 that presented Black Americans in their own words and images. (A beautifully illustrated volume based on that exhibition came out in 2019 as “Black Lives 1900: W.E.B. Du Bois at the Paris Exposition.”) In those years, the Black community of D.C. was divided between Booker T. Washington’s supporters and younger backers of Du Bois. Against her father’s wishes, Pope in 1906 joined the Niagara Movement. She was among its first female members.

Her pathbreaking train ride toward a Virginia hot springs resort that summer didn’t start as a statement. When Pope went to buy her ticket, she simply wanted a peaceful ride, she told the ticket agent. She “had been annoyed before” by Virginia’s Jim Crow rule and “didn’t want to be annoyed that way” again, according to her testimony in court records.

She boarded at Union Station and saw the “colored” compartment was cramped and its seats faced backward. She took a seat in the main compartment instead. After they crossed the Potomac into Virginia, a White conductor came and said she had to move. She refused. He threatened her with arrest. She refused again.

When the train stopped at Falls Church, Pope was escorted off by constables and detained for hours at the mayor’s office. Even after posting bail, she was held for public humiliation in the train station, waiting for her hearing. The mayor set up a kangaroo court in the station. Pope was tried for “violating the separate car law of the State of Virginia” and fined $10 plus court costs.

Two weeks later, at the Niagara Movement’s annual meeting at Harpers Ferry, W.Va., Pope’s case was on the agenda. The group of more than 50 considered whether an appeal to overturn her conviction could be a test case. As an interstate traveler, was she subject to Virginia’s Jim Crow statutes? Du Bois had doubts about using the judiciary for social change — just three years earlier, he had written in “The Souls of Black Folk” that to place Black Americans “in the hands of Southern courts was impossible” — but the group at Harpers Ferry voted to fund Pope’s appeal in the Virginia circuit court anyway.

Few were surprised when Pope lost her appeal that October at an Alexandria circuit court, but with Niagara’s legal support, she took the case to Virginia’s Supreme Court of Appeals. In early 1907, that second appeal triumphed when the higher court annulled the initial judgment. “This means that the NIAGARA MOVEMENT has established that under the present statute Virginia cannot fine an interstate passenger who refuses to be Jim-Crowed,” Du Bois explained in an April 1907 fundraising letter.

Du Bois included the court’s full statement with his letter, and the Niagara Movement followed up with a civil suit demanding $50,000 in damages. In June 1907, the civil trial opened in D.C. The jury voted in Pope’s favor but awarded her just one penny. Still, the decision by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia — which had both local and federal jurisdiction until Congress separated those powers in 1973 — showed that interstate travelers could successfully challenge Jim Crow in federal court.

Pope’s fortunes, however, took a turn for the worse. She lost her job and suffered from insomnia. One evening in September 1908, at age 54, she walked out onto Lovers’ Lane, beside Montrose Park in Georgetown, pinned a note addressed to the coroner to her dress, and hanged herself. The note said she felt her brain was “on fire.”

Jennifer Harris writes that the stigma around suicide helped erase the public record of Pope’s contributions: “[I]t was considered impolite to discuss suicides, so her story — and stories — faded into obscurity.” Nevertheless, historian Deborah Lee, who has studied Pope and the Niagara Movement, says that Pope, along with Du Bois, created “a cornerstone of the 20th-century civil rights movement.”

For her part, Ann Chinn is heartened that her great-aunt’s story is coming to light. “I hope that it will encourage researchers and historians to look for others lesser known but just as impactful,” she told me. “It’s not just the Malcolm Xs and the Martin Luther Kings. It’s your mother, your father, your teacher — those people whose names will never go into recorded history.”

Why did Latino men shift toward Trump in 2020? I looked to my dad for answers.,"In 2016, my dad, Charlie Garcia — a third-generation Mexican American and lifelong Republican — supported Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP presidential nomination contest. Recently, he recalled that, of the 17 candidates who ran for the Republican nomination in 2016, “Trump was my 17th.” Toward the end of the election, I remember him saying that he would “hold my nose and vote for Trump.”

But by this past November, something had changed. As far as I can tell, my dad voted while breathing through his nose as clearly as somebody could when wearing a face mask. Not only did he enthusiastically support Donald Trump, he gave money to the Republican National Committee. Though he has supported every GOP presidential candidate since 1980, he now contrasts them all unfavorably with Trump. “They can’t compare with what Trump has done,” he told me recently. “And some of the things that he came up with I said, ‘Oh man, why did you do that, Trump? That’s not going to go over well.’ And it turns out, my God, what a brilliant move! I had no idea. He’s just a master.”

A native of San Antonio, my dad spent much of his career working in sales; these days, he runs residential care facilities for the elderly in Orange County, Calif. His mother and father were born in the United States. My grandfather’s mother was likely born in France, but his father was Mexican while my grandmother’s parents were likely from Monterrey, Mexico. That mix of Mexican and American is why he calls me both “son” and its Spanish equivalent, “mijo.”

When I was growing up, we frequently watched Fox News (these days, like many conservatives, my dad prefers Newsmax); he regularly listens to conservative talk radio when he isn’t listening to classic-rock stations. He proudly displays a plaque that Ronald Reagan gave my grandfather for his service as a paratrooper in World War II. He has told me that The Washington Post, where I used to work, regularly makes things up about Trump. When he came to visit me in D.C. and we walked past CNN’s building, he half-jokingly said, “Fake news.”

My dad’s politics wouldn’t be of much interest to the wider world, except that he’s part of a group that constituted one of the most puzzling footnotes to the 2020 election: Latinos who voted for Trump. Between 2016 and 2020, Trump improved his overall support among Latinos by four percentage points, while Biden’s support declined from Hillary Clinton’s by one point — and in some places the change was even more significant. In Florida, Biden won Latinos by just five points, a massive swing from Clinton’s 27-point margin in 2016. In Texas, Trump closed the margin among Latino voters by 10 points.

To many progressives, the trend was a shock — how could a president who so brazenly denigrated Latinos and immigrants actually increase his stock among those same voters? — but it was also a wake-up call. For a generation, Democrats have taken comfort in the assumption that long-term demographics were on their side: As America became less and less White, Democrats would enjoy an increasing advantage in national politics. The growing Latino vote was a — maybe the — linchpin of this thinking. Which means that if, in fact, Latinos are drifting from Democrats, it constitutes an emergency for the party, one that could haunt them in 2022, 2024 and beyond.

Drawing on a number of conversations with experts, plus two with my dad, I recently spent time trying to figure out why this was happening. There are no simple answers, but I was particularly intrigued by one subplot of the story of Latino voters: Nationally, Biden won Latino men by 23 points but Latinas by 39 points. In 2016, Clinton won Latino men by 31 points and Latinas by 44. In other words, Trump gained among both groups over four years, but he gained more among men. In some states, the 2020 gender disparity among Hispanic voters was quite dramatic. In North Carolina, Trump won Latino men by 20 points but lost Latinas by 54 points. In Nevada, Biden won Latino men by only six points but Latinas by 47 points. Why, I wondered, did Latino men seem to be shifting to the right? And what could Democrats do to win them back?

Writing about gender differences within the Latino vote is inherently thorny terrain. There’s a long-standing, racist stereotype that associates Latino men with machismo — and, as we all saw for the past six years, Trump’s political brand was built partly on an exaggerated macho sensibility. Ian Haney López, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told me that there is a risk of reducing Latino men’s support of Trump to being about machismo — which takes “a pervasive social dynamic” and makes it into “an attribute of Latino culture.” “Patriarchy is a problem across racial groups,” he says, though he adds: “It’s also fair to say if you’re a man in a low-status group, masculinity may become more important to claiming high status.”

A better place to start might be jobs: what the experiences of men and women look like in the American economy right now, and how that might influence their thinking about politics. Stephanie Valencia of EquisLabs, a Democratic research firm that surveyed Latino voters in 11 states starting in 2019, says that, in the run-up to the election, they found plenty of men who had what she called “Trump intrigue.” “They see him as the successful businessman, and they see him as somebody who has built himself up from his bootstraps, even though we all know that’s not necessarily true,” she told me.

That may contrast with the experiences of Latinas, many of whom are running their households, managing child care or employed as front-line and domestic workers — nurses or caretakers for the elderly. “They are making sure their kids are prepared for Zoom school,” Valencia explains. “I think there’s a fundamentally different experience that Hispanic men and women have in both what they experience day to day and what information they consume.”

Trump’s image as a straight-talking businessman was definitely part of what appealed to my dad. He liked that Trump was a graduate of the Wharton School and that the former president grew up with men similar to those who worked with my grandfather. “We’d run into the electrical contractor’s union or somebody else working in houses, building houses. Every one of them talked like Trump,” my dad said. “No big words. Everything was very, very simple. And Trump learned to do that. He learned to master that, where he can communicate.”

Between 2016 and 2020, Trump improved his support among Latinos by four percentage points. To many progressives, the trend was a shock — and a wake-up call.

Kevin Marino Cabrera, formerly Trump’s Florida state director, cites the former president’s economic record from before the coronavirus pandemic, including “historic unemployment and employment for all minorities across the board.” And Tomas Robles, co-executive for the progressive activist group Living United for Change in Arizona, argues that Democrats haven’t done a good strategic job in this area. “They don’t know yet how to talk about the economy in a way that resonates with Latinos, especially men of color,” Robles says. “I think a big reason why Trump did slightly better with not just Latino men, but other men of color, especially Black men, was because he had an economic message, and he had an economic message that he tailored to men of color.” Indeed, Trump’s campaign ran a Spanish-language ad with a catchy jingle that specifically mentioned the economy.

Haney López has conducted research with Equis showing that 28 percent of Hispanics perceive themselves as part of a group that “over generations can get ahead through hard work.” He also found that 32 percent of Hispanics see themselves as a group similar to European American immigrants who can join the mainstream. “The rhetoric that the right is using uses language that is designed to trigger racist stereotypes associated with whiteness,” Haney López says. He adds that for many Latinos, there is a desire to be esteemed and recognized as someone who cares for their family rather than as a violent protester or as an outsider. “This status anxiety is inseparable from this racist hierarchy,” he says.

Both Latino men and women may share economic and status anxiety, of course. But Latinas — like female voters across ethnic categories — were repelled by Trump’s disrespect toward women and his bragging about sexual assault. “When we conducted focus groups with Latinas, they were highly attuned to the ways Trump was insulting them as women,” Haney López says. “They felt more attacked as women than they did as Latinos.”

In the constant push and pull between economic and cultural issues in the Democratic coalition, it’s possible that, for some Latino men, left-wing cultural politics have proved off-putting. It’s been well-documented at this point that most Latinos don’t use the gender-neutral term “Latinx,” but the male-female breakdown is noteworthy. According to Pew Research Center, 14 percent of Latinas between 18 and 29 use the term, but only 1 percent of Latino men in the same age group use it.

Valencia points out that younger Latino men are in the same social media spaces as their White counterparts. “They’re watching Joe Rogan, too,” she says, referring to the popular podcast host and antagonist of the cultural left. “They’re consuming a lot of the same information that White working-class young men are consuming.”

Randall Avila, the executive director of the Orange County Republican Party, says Latino men appreciated Trump’s lack of political correctness. “We kind of resonate with the president even though we may not agree with everything he says,” Avila told me. “He speaks his mind and he doesn’t sugarcoat things, so I think some of that personality style also played into Latino support for the president as well.”

News reports before and after the election speculated that Trump’s tough talk on immigration, as well as his “law and order” rhetoric, helped with some Latino men. In fact, especially in some border communities, law enforcement is a major employer of Latino men. According to Department of Homeland Security statistics for 2019, 30 percent of all U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are Hispanic. (Hispanic men accounted for 11.8 percent of hires, while Hispanic women accounted for 8.1 percent.)

Of course, not all Latinos who work in law enforcement share Trump’s view of immigrants. David Cortez, a professor at the University of Notre Dame, interviewed Latino agents who worked for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Arizona, Texas and California in 2014 and 2015. Plenty of the people in the study tended to join the agency for economic reasons. Cortez says that, despite the ICE union’s support for Trump, not all Latinos who worked on the border fit the “MAGA, machismo” model of “right-leaning, staunch, anti-immigration restrictionists.” “What you’ll find is that the majority of them have more-nuanced positions on immigration and immigration policy than most elected officials,” says Cortez, who is from Brownsville, Tex., “because they’re the ones who see it on a daily basis.”

Still, it’s reasonable to assume that, if Democrats are seen as the party of open borders and far-left immigration policies, that might turn off at least some Latinos who work in border enforcement. Meanwhile, Latinos make up 12.5 percent of local police officers as of 2016, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a jump from 7.8 percent in 1997 (and police forces are overwhelmingly male). And according to a 2017 Pew Research study, White and Latino police officers have similar views on the police killing of unarmed Black people — with 72 percent of both groups saying they were isolated incidents rather than signs of a broader problem. By comparison, 57 percent of Black police officers think the killings are signs of a bigger problem.

To progressives, all of this is a sinister example of politicians dividing a community against itself. “One of the perversities of dog-whistle politics, of this fearmongering against people of color,” says Haney López, “is that it has created a whole employment sector for working-class people in the area of government violence against working-class people, especially with people of color.”

But conservative Latinos themselves see things differently. Avila has three family members who work in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. He says Trump’s “law and order” message resonated with many Latinos. “They saw the president as someone who stood up for them,” Avila says, “whether it’s my family that’s actually in law enforcement or family who obviously loves and cares about my uncles and my aunts. We kind of saw that message of who was supporting the police department and who wasn’t.”

There isn’t, of course, one clear explanation for why Latino men seem to be drifting, as a group, to the right. Every individual vote is a sum of many factors, and it’s tough to attach a simple explanation to any of them. Indeed, when I asked my dad about what he liked about Trump, he replied, “Oh my God, son, the list is endless.” As he walked around his neighborhood in January — 10 days after Biden was inaugurated — and spoke to me on the phone, he rattled off a litany of what he saw as Trump’s accomplishments: lower taxes, diplomatic agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the low Black and Latino unemployment rates before covid-19 wrecked the economy. He praised Trump’s tough stance on China and his move to subsidize farmers to offset the effects of his trade conflict.

None of these policy preferences are unique to Latinos or to Latino men. But when a group shifts dramatically, it’s impossible not to at least guess at broad explanations. And for Democrats, there’s a lot riding on trying to get these explanations right. Perhaps the most important thing to realize is that no party is entitled to a constituency. Every campaign has to work to actively court Latino voters. Instead of expecting — as many progressives do — Latino men to automatically vote against someone who works against their “self-interest,” it might be better to ask what Latino men actually see as their best interests and how they view themselves — and then adjust accordingly.

To be sure, different Latinos will respond to the same message in disparate ways: A message like Sen. Bernie Sanders’s democratic socialism that resonated with Latinos in Nevada and California in the Democratic primary may terrify Cuban American and Venezuelan American voters in Miami who fled socialist regimes.

Trump’s “law and order” message resonated with many Latinos, says Randall Avila of the Orange County Republican Party: “They saw the president as someone who stood up for them.”

But one place that Democrats probably can’t go wrong is to focus relentlessly on jobs and the economy. José Dante Parra, who previously worked for Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign and is now chief executive of the communications firm ProsperoLatino, thinks this is the best way to reach Latino men. “Doubling down on those policies and messaging it to the community will really help us, in the long run, develop a narrative where Latino men feel that they’re being talked to,” he says. “The biggest thing for Latino men was jobs and the economy ... being usually the main breadwinners in the family.”

With Republican senators like Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio trying to rebrand the GOP as a “multiethnic, multiracial working-class coalition,” Democrats will need to call their bluff by laying out a clear agenda for working-class Americans. If Latino men see themselves as aspirational Americans who want to pick themselves up by the bootstraps, perhaps the best message is one that offers a way into the middle class and economic security.

And none of this, by the way, is to suggest that Democrats should ignore Latina voters, who largely share similar priorities. (I should note here that my parents are divorced and my mom is a Democrat.) On the contrary, says Valencia at Equis, it is important to remember that working-class Latinas are voters who “we need to further understand and invest in to continue to make part of the progressive base, because on the issues they are there.”

Looking ahead to 2024, I asked my dad who he liked as a potential Republican presidential candidate. He was cagey about Trump’s children. In his eyes, Don Jr. is not ready yet and he “would probably never vote” for Ivanka. He likes Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Chip Roy of Texas and Matt Gaetz of Florida — but, he said, “one day, I think the best president we have ever in our lifetime would be Tom Cotton,” the senator from Arkansas.

The day pro-Trump rioters crashed the Capitol trying to stop the certification of votes, my dad texted me to ask if I was safe and told me to “stay away from all the crowds in D.C.” However, he does not hold Trump responsible for what happened that day. “These are all good people, good levelheaded, hard-working people,” he says of those who supported the “Stop the Steal” rally, noting that Trump told protesters to let their voices be heard peacefully.

Democrats can certainly make inroads with Latino men — though my dad, as you can see, won’t be one of them. Instead, he’s a very stark reminder that Latinos span the political spectrum — and that, as confusing as it may be to progressives and to many pundits, it’s absolutely possible for some percentage of Americans to think of themselves as archconservatives and as Latinos. Even if he doesn’t “wear it on my sleeve,” as he puts it, my dad is very proud of his heritage as a Mexican American. In January, we ended our conversation as we normally do when I’m not interviewing him. “I love you with all my heart, Dad,” I said. “I love you too, mijo,” he replied. “You take good care.”

Date Lab: ‘The most interesting part of the date was when we talked about rating it’,"As the 5 p.m. Zoom date approached, Anney confessed that she was all nerves. “What if something terrible happens and it goes viral? It’s giving up control,” she said. Anney, a writer and an English lecturer, has dated men and women in the past. She is drawn to people who are “close to their family, artistic and passionate about something.”

We set her up with a fella who is definitely passionate — about statistics. Keith Zirkle, 29, who works as a statistician, was relaxed about meeting Anney, but his mind was occupied elsewhere. “I’m very focused on the confounding variables,” he told me. “The date can’t end too early or everyone will know it went bad.”

AD

The Virginia native is also open to dating men and women. “I started dating men about a year and a half ago. It didn’t feel drastically different. But I have not successfully dated a man either, so it really hasn’t impacted success,” he said with a laugh.

He was excited about this opportunity because he feels “desensitized” by dating apps. He’s seeking someone who is “adventurous, ambitious and has intellectual curiosity.”

In preparation for the date, Anney made sure to have “the varsity team” of her 50 plants on display, and Keith noticed her efforts. “She had a bunch of big plants behind her and they were live plants, not fake,” he said. “She was fake insulted when I asked her if they were real.” Keith revealed that he had faux plants, and Anney told me, “At first I was like, ‘Oh. He’s a fake.’ But then he said he saved them from the dumpster and I thought, ‘Aww. He recycles!’ ”

AD

As far as first impressions go, they seemed to be on the same page. Keith said she was “really cute” and looked “bookish” in her glasses. Anney’s reaction: “He’s a cute guy on a screen.”

While chatting over dinner, Keith discovered that Anney had a desire to support a local restaurant when she ordered food. He felt that move showed that she is kind, which is something he values in people. Anney felt similarly when Keith told her that he is more afraid of giving someone covid than getting it. “It’s important to me to be with someone who thinks and cares about other people,” she said.

As the evening went on, the conversation took a slightly dark turn. “He asked, ‘If you could know when you are going to die, would you want to know?’ I said no and he said yes, so he could plan,” Anney told me. “He’s very pragmatic.”

“If I only have a handful of days left to live, I would do more and see more, but if I have 60 more years, I have time to pace things,” said Keith. “In general, I think we should all ‘live like you were dying,’ to quote Tim McGraw.”

AD

Anney wasn’t taken aback by the morbid conversation. “I appreciate it more than talking about what TV shows we like. Let’s be real with each other. Let’s challenge each other,” she said.

Keith felt they were kindred spirits when it came to talking about their academic pursuits. “Most people glaze over, but we were more seriously interested in what the other person studied and learned,” he said. “I was interested in her writing. She has a lot of intellectual curiosity.”

At 7:30, they wrapped up the date, and Keith asked for her number and suggested going on a hike in a few weeks. While Anney was happy to exchange cell numbers, there was another number that intrigued her more. “The most interesting part of the date was when we talked about rating it,” she said. “He is a statistician, so he used a phrase like ‘confidence interval,’ and I am a [lecturer] and I believe in labor-based grading.” According to Anney, they agreed to give each other the same rating. “So if he doesn’t, then he is misrepresenting,” she said with a chuckle.

Rate the date

Anney: 4.55 [out of 5]. “The conversation was good enough that I’m willing to see if we both have chemistry.”

AD

AD

Keith: 4.12. He had decided his rating before their discussion about an agreed upon number. “It was a good date, we got along, and a 3, while being a true average, would seem like a ding. But it didn’t reach the 4.5 wow factor.”

Update

After thinking about it for a few days, Anney texted Keith that she wasn’t feeling a romantic connection but was still interested in keeping in touch if he was. Keith agreed that he too didn’t feel any chemistry. “All in all, Anney seems like a great person, but a pandemic is not always ideal for sustaining new friendships, so we shall see,” Keith said.

Lucky Danger restaurant review: Two chefs want to have fun with American Chinese food,"Carryout from Lucky Danger, the American Chinese takeout that opened in November in Mount Vernon Triangle, elicits a grin as you unpack it. The sturdy round compostable containers and white rectangular cartons are so attractive, there’s no need to transfer their contents to serving dishes. Just as sweet, the packages come with labels identifying what’s inside (“these are oranges” describes some citrus wedges) and a tiny cartoon figure. A restaurant with a sense of humor! Even the thick napkins show flair.

Chef Tim Ma made three requests of the branding firm he enlisted to shape his pop-up, which operates out of Prather’s on the Alley. “Timelessness was important,” he says. The menu also had to be fun. “Privately,” says Ma, “I’m a goofy person.” Hence his call for a mascot. The eventual menu, retro in red and white, asks customers to play safe — “No Mask. No Honor. No Service” — and reveals the character of Lucky Danger. The mascot turns out to be 10 or so little chefs in animal costumes — Dragon Boy, Shark Boy, Lion Boy, etc. — some of whom customers get to know from a sheet of stickers in each bag.

AD

AD

As for the actual food, the inspiration for Lucky Danger comes from the chef’s uncle, Paul Ma, who ran a storefront-turned-restaurant in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. Now closed, Paul Ma’s China Kitchen was part of a 2019 exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History: “Food, Transforming the American Table.” The event brought multiple generations of family members to Washington to reminisce. Similar to his uncle’s business, the D.C. takeout specializes in American Chinese food, which Ma, 43, defines as “food that immigrants from China brought over and essentially updated for the American palate,” and adapted using common or cheaper Western ingredients.

Things like crab rangoon, he says, which “isn’t recognized in China.” The notion of crab (real or imitation) and cream cheese stuffed into a spring roll wrapper and fried to a crisp was popularized by Trader Vic’s, the chain of Polynesian-inspired watering holes with roots in the San Francisco Bay Area, and also lives on today at places including P.F. Chang’s. The warm and wispy, rich and creamy version at Lucky Danger is a delightful throwback to America’s love affair with all things tiki, which coincided in the 1940s and 1950s with mainstream acceptance of American Chinese spots.

Ma’s portfolio includes the Eaton hotel, home to American Son, and Laoban Dumplings, the source of Lucky Danger’s delicious dumplings, stuffed with ground pork and Chinese chives. The day-to-day presence at Lucky Danger is co-founder Andrew Chiou, 32, who comes to the project from the closed Momo Yakitori in Woodridge. Both chefs are the children of Taiwanese immigrants; Ma was born in Arkansas and Chiou in Texas.

Their menu at Lucky Danger is a mash-up of standard-issue Chinese takeout fare along with a sprinkling of dishes that Ma and Chiou remember their parents ordering off menus written in Chinese when they were kids. Read: hot and sour soup, kung pao chicken and broccoli beef, but also pig ear salad, mapo tofu and flounder with pickled cabbage. The selections slip in reminders that the chefs are both steeped in technique. Their fried rice sets the bar for the staple in Washington, made as it is with duck breast — rubbed with spices including star anise and coriander and cold-smoked with tea leaves — and confit duck legs. Succulent shreds of duck help fill the carton with glossy rice, shredded yellow egg and sweet minced carrots. “We can’t help ourselves,” Ma says about the fancy-fication of fried rice.

The chefs’ experience and standards translate to American Chinese food that’s true to its roots and superior to much of the competition.

AD

One reason the kung pao chicken doesn’t linger long on my table is because every part of it shows TLC. The peanuts and peppers are first toasted with dried garlic. The vegetables are uniformly diced. The sauce — made by caramelizing sugar, then adding soy sauce — gets made to order, and it sweetens chicken that’s twice fried.

Ma and Chiou also know some dishes don’t need much tinkering. While they experimented with sweet-and-sour sauce, going so far as to swap in fresh cranberries for different brands of ketchup, they ultimately concluded that “Heinz is the signature flavor of sweet and sour,” says Chiou.

Admittedly, a few dishes are no better than the ones you get from places for the sake of convenience rather than execution. Lucky Danger’s beef and broccoli is equal parts soft meat and sodden vegetable.

But the majority of the choices beat what you get from takeouts without name chefs. I’m thinking now of braised flounder swimming with tangy pickled cabbage, soft leaves alternating with crisp ones. And orange beef. Lucky Danger uses a lesser cut of meat — bottom sirloin — but scores each piece twice, in part to catch the sauce, and breads the bites in a combination of cornstarch and wheat flour. The unusual brightness of the dish is due to oranges being peeled just as they’re needed. Salt-and-pepper shrimp stars springy seafood in a jumble of sliced jalapeños and smoky-sweet onions. A category called “Veggies Mostly” includes a mapo tofu that comes out punching and wok-singed green beans tossed with soy sauce and garlic.

AD

AD

Thirsty? Lucky Danger has you covered, with a line of canned cocktails, including Duck Sauce. That’s tequila lit with Sichuan peppercorns and subtly fruity with lemon and peach.

Don’t shoot the messenger, but it takes patience to taste the place. For now at least, orders, tied to pickup times, can be made only online, beginning at 10 a.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Scrambling to secure one of the 62 slots feels like playing whack-a-mole. An online FAQ lets eaters with dietary restrictions down gently: “If you are on a gluten-free, soy-free, and/or sesame-free journey, then we just weren’t meant to be. It’s not you, it’s us!!” And once you’ve placed your order, there are “no refunds, no modifications, no soup for you (unless you ordered soup).” And you should, by the way. The duck bone broth, paired with thin rice noodles and crisp with scallions, fairly hums with ginger. Billed as an appetizer, the restorative is best experienced at the end of a meal, says Chiou.

Preordering is good for the business, in that the operators know exactly how much food to prepare, and for when, a drill that also benefits customers, says Chiou. The process also minimizes waste.

AD

AD

That said, indoor kiosks are part of the finessed plan for the second branch of Lucky Danger, expected to open in late April in Arlington’s Westpost shopping center (formerly Pentagon Row). Ma has tasked his branding team to come up with an “escape room” aesthetic. Stay tuned. Washington’s Lucky Danger will stay where it is until the end of the year, until Prather’s reopens. Lucky for locals, Ma plans to find another spot in Mount Vernon Triangle.

Chiou sounds proud to pay tribute to American Chinese cooking. “Tim and I are having fun, with food we have roots to,” says the chef, who describes Lucky Danger as filling the gap between modest and fancy. To which I can only add, pass the fortune cookies and party on.

"Some of America’s wealthiest hospital systems ended up even richer, thanks to federal bailouts","But Baylor not only weathered the crisis, it thrived. By the end of 2020, Baylor had accumulated an $815 million surplus, $20 million more than it had in 2019, creating a 7.5 percent operating margin that would be higher than most hospitals’ profits in the flushest of eras, a KHN examination of financial statements shows.

Like Baylor, some of the nation’s richest hospitals and health systems recorded hundreds of millions of dollars in surpluses after accepting a substantial share of the federal health-care bailout grants, their records show. Those included the Mayo Clinic, Pittsburgh’s UPMC and NYU Langone Health. But poorer hospitals — many serving rural and minority populations — got a tinier slice of the pie and limped through the year with deficits, downgrades of their bond ratings and bleak fiscal futures.

“A lot of the funding helped the wealthy hospitals at a time, especially in New York, when safety-net hospitals were hemorrhaging,” said Colleen Grogan, a health policy professor at the University of Chicago. “We could have tailored it to hospitals we knew were really suffering and taking on a disproportionate amount of the burden.”

In Baylor’s case, the system, which runs Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and 51 other hospitals, said it spent $257 million last year on pandemic-related costs, including protective clothing for employees and patients and creating isolation rooms. Baylor has $197 million in unspent federal relief funds to use this year to cover costs of battling the virus and refrigerating vaccines, it said.

AD

AD

“Our covid-19-related expenses and lost revenue continue to exceed the funding we have received to date,” Baylor said in a statement to KHN.

Other well-heeled hospitals or large systems faced bigger problems. Both NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and CommonSpirit Health, a 140-hospital Catholic system that operates in 21 states, lost money despite federal grants in the vicinity of a billion dollars each. A few systems, including the for-profit chain HCA Healthcare, returned federal funds when they saw they had skirted their worst-case scenarios. But most spent the aid and held onto any leftover money and new grants to cover anticipated pandemic costs this year because hospital executives fear more case spikes.

Much of the lopsided distribution was caused by the way the Department of Health and Human Services based the allotment of the initial bailout funds on hospitals’ past revenue. That favored institutions with well-off patients who have private health plans over those that rely on lower-paying government insurance, which is what many poor people use.

AD

AD

HHS distribution formulas did not take into account which ho s pitals had enough assets to survive.

Baylor, for instance, began 2020 with $5.4 billion in cash and investments, enough to keep it running for 238 days, the financial disclosures show.

Hospitals that ended the year with profits were entitled to federal aid because of the extraordinary latitude Congress and HHS set in how hospitals could classify their pandemic costs.

Last fall, when HHS attempted to limit how much aid hospitals could keep based on their profits — so the money could be redirected to struggling hospitals — the effort was swiftly beaten back by the industry and Congress. HHS officials declined requests for an interview but noted in a statement that Congress had ordered it to revert to its “broader definition of permissible use of PRF funds.”

AD

AD

“The Biden Administration continues to review programs and policies including considerations for the unallocated funding under the PRF program and the $8.5 billion recently appropriated under the recently signed American Rescue Plan Act,” the statement said.

Avoiding a drawdown of reserves

The bailouts were initiated last spring to help health-care providers ride out a once-in-a-century public health calamity. The money designated to hospitals and other health-care providers from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (Cares) Act and subsequent legislation totaled $178 billion.

It was intended to offset all costs of treating infected patients, including purchasing ventilators, masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment. Congress further authorized hospitals to use the money to compensate for a drop in revenue when they shut down elective surgeries and non-emergency treatments to prepare for the anticipated deluge of covid-19 patients.

AD

AD

The money, referred to as the Provider Relief Fund, helped many poorer hospitals avert cash crunches, layoffs and bond rating downgrades. A survey by the consulting firm Kaufman Hall found that the median hospital gain during 2020 would have been 0.3 percent without the federal support. With it, half of hospitals posted gains of 2.7 percent or more, below the 2019 median margin of 3.1 percent, according to the firm, which also produces analytic work for the American Hospital Association.

In February, the association urged Congress to replenish the nearly empty relief fund, saying, “hospitals have never experienced such a widespread, national health crisis.”

Some hospitals’ finances deteriorated significantly during the pandemic. From the end of March through December, the rating agency Moody’s downgraded 28 hospitals, primarily because of weaknesses such as higher debt or more competition, said Lisa Goldstein, associate managing director at Moody’s.

AD

AD

Others suffered worse fates, such as Williamson Memorial Hospital, which shut down last April. The hospital, in West Virginia’s coal country, had been trying to climb out of bankruptcy protection, but “unfortunately, the decline in volumes experienced from the current pandemic were to[o] sudden and severe for us to sustain operations,” its CEO wrote on Facebook.

Conversely, many prosperous health systems emerged unscathed from the moratoriums of last spring, often due to the federal aid. “It gave them an ability to not have to draw down on their reserves to make up for the loss in revenue,” said Suzie Desai, a senior director at S&P Global Ratings.

Systems saw patient visits return to near normal as the year wore on. In some cases, business in the latter half of 2020 was even higher than in the same period in 2019 because of pent-up demand for treatments postponed from the spring, financial records show.

AD

AD

“We saw volumes spring back” in every area except emergency room visits, said Kevin Holloran, a senior director at Fitch Ratings. Major hospital systems also reported that cases tended to be more complex than normal, leading to higher insurance payments.

UPMC accepted $460 million in bailout funds while collecting $2.5 billion more in revenue in 2020 than in 2019. The nonprofit system ended the year with an $836 million operating surplus — providing a 3.6 percent margin that was triple the prior year’s — in part due to the growth of the health insurance plan the system owns.

Other hospitals that sold insurance, including Baylor, persevered because the cause of their financial troubles — fewer surgeries and doctors’ visits — meant the health plans paid fewer claims.

AD

UPMC’s strong finances went unmentioned in a recent fundraising pitch announcing the launch of its “Health Care Heroes” campaign. “During the past year, health care workers have carried the weight of the world on their shoulders, risking their own health and safety to ensure ours as we navigated the covid-19 pandemic,” the email said. “Now it’s our turn to recognize their hard work. … By making a donation, you will help provide training, recognition, and support for our staff initiatives.”

AD

Donald Yealy, senior vice president, UPMC and chief medical officer, UPMC Health Services, said the fundraising appeal was a way to allow people in the community to show their appreciation.

“The intent of the request and the letter were clear. People are free to ignore or to have an opinion. I don’t begrudge that at all. I respect people having a different opinion,"" he said.

AD

Hospitals can hold on to unspent relief funds until the end of July to defray any further pandemic-related costs. After that, any unspent money must be returned to the U.S. Treasury. UPMC retains $80 million in unspent relief funds, which the health system said it expects to use. “We’re still in the process of incurring significant costs related to covid,” said Edward Karlovich, UPMC executive vice president and chief financial officer.

‘A shot in the arm’ sometimes unneeded

In April 2020, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., forecast up to $3 billion in lost revenue because of the pandemic. Instead, Mayo, which received $338 million in federal relief funds, ended the year with revenue that was $202 million higher than in 2019. Mayo recorded a $728 million surplus, which equaled a 5.2 percent margin.

“It gave us a shot in the arm when we needed it,” said Dennis Dahlen, Mayo’s chief financial officer. Later, when it seemed likely Mayo would run a surplus, executives debated what to do with the federal funds.

“Honestly, we considered dropping the margin,” Dahlen said. After weighing its options, Mayo “landed in a middle-of-the-road decision” by returning $156 million to the federal government.

“We considered it with what everyone else was doing … and we thought about what was good for society,” Dahlen said. “Nonprofit doesn’t really mean no profit. It means tax-exempt. We still have to create earnings so we can reinvest in ourselves.”

Mayo ended the year with $14 billion in investments, $3 billion more than it had in 2019, a 29 percent increase.

The funds were, indeed, a lifesaver for some. Marvin O’Quinn, president and chief operating officer of CommonSpirit Health, said “there was never a thought of turning back the money.”

Despite receiving $1.3 billion in relief funds, CommonSpirit, based in Chicago, ended last year with a $75 million deficit, which translated to a 0.2 percent loss.

“We have been set back by a year,” O’Quinn said. “All the things we wanted to do — to renovate, to build new facilities, to expand our service — we’ve had to slow up to get through the crisis.”

Scattershot relief

The first $50 billion in relief funds “was sent out indiscriminately as a life support,” said Ge Bai, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. HHS tried to target subsequent distributions. It sent $22 billion to 1,090 hospitals with large numbers of covid-19 patients. It sprinkled an additional $16 billion among hospitals that serve poor populations, Native American tribes, people in rural areas and children.

But even with the targeted aid, recipients included well-endowed academic medical centers and major urban hospitals. Only $14 billion took profitability into consideration, HHS documents show. HHS restricted those payments to hospitals with 3 percent or lower profit margins.

Wealthy hospitals also benefited because HHS used a broad definition of lost revenue. If a hospital earned less than in the year before, or simply less revenue than it had budgeted for, it could chalk up that difference to the pandemic and apply the relief funds to it. The implications garnered little attention at the time as they were overshadowed by the concerns about how HHS was doling out the money rather than how it could be used.

In September, HHS attempted to tighten its overall limits on how much money the hospitals could keep by basing it on the difference from the previous year’s net income rather than overall revenue — a number that in many cases would be much lower. The goal, the department said, was to “prohibit most providers from using PRF [Provider Relief Fund] payments to become more profitable than they were pre-pandemic, to conserve resources to allocate to providers who were less profitable.”

The American Hospital Association complained that would punish hospitals that had behaved responsibly by cutting costs and be an “administrative and accounting disaster,” as many hospitals had already spent the grant money.

HHS backed down a month later, citing “significant attention and opposition from many stakeholders and Members of Congress.” Not fully satisfied, Congress cemented the rollback in a December law.

Some hospital executives attributed their surpluses to their aggressive cost-cutting measures.

NYU Langone Health, for instance, received $461 million in relief funds, which covered about a third of its pandemic-related losses, said Daniel Widawsky, chief financial officer. Another third of Langone’s losses was absorbed by the record-high financial performance in the months before the pandemic, he said, and prompt cost control addressed the rest.

Widawsky said that at the beginning of March Langone canceled travel, froze hiring, paused construction and stopped discretionary purchases. “The first three days in March, we locked down spending,” he said. “If they wanted to buy a pencil, they had to call me.” Langone ended its fiscal year in August with $208 million in net income, and recorded a $136 million surplus in the final quarter of 2020, or 5.5 percent. Earlier this year, two credit agencies upgraded their outlook on Langone from stable to positive.

Despite accepting $942 million in bailout funds, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital had a $457 million operating deficit, a 7 percent loss, at the end of September. It was a sharp turn from September 2019, when the system recorded a $166 million surplus, a 2.5 percent gain.

The system, which declined to comment, has not yet released its financial metrics for the final three months of 2020, but Fitch projected it would remain in the red. Still, NewYork-Presbyterian remains fiscally solid: Its most recent disclosure reported $3.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, enough to keep operating for more than a year.",2021-04-01 00:00:00
How Larry Summers went from Obama’s top economic adviser to one of Biden’s loudest critics,"Just about everywhere you look in the Biden White House, you can see former treasury secretary Larry Summers’s influence. Everywhere, that is, except for the policies.

Summers, 66, who drafted economic blueprints for the past two Democratic presidents and was a top candidate to lead the Federal Reserve Board under President Barack Obama, has emerged in recent weeks as the loudest critic of President Biden’s approach to reviving the pandemic-era U.S. economy. The Harvard University professor — who advised Biden for a time last summer — warns that the president’s stimulus plan may trigger the highest inflation in more than half a century and could cost Democrats the chance to make lasting investments in the economy.

Summers’s Cassandra-like critique has ignited a firestorm among some of the most liberal members of his party, who blame him for financial industry deregulation in the 1990s that contributed to the financial crisis and for the anemic recovery that followed. But his arguments also have been swatted aside by his erstwhile allies in the White House, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, who argue that the economy is in desperate need of help.

“This might not have struck as much a nerve if it didn’t reflect concerns that were widely felt,” Summers said in a 45-minute telephone interview last week.

The extraordinary clash between a globally recognized Democratic economist and a Democratic president hoping to enact the most transformative liberal agenda since the Great Society involves both the central issues of the day and the lessons of history.

If he at times uses dramatic language, Summers nonetheless has given voice to an unpopular opinion that many in the Democratic camp say deserves consideration. Few other Democratic economists have aired such concerns; some say doing so might harm Biden’s ability to translate his fragile congressional majority into decisive action.

Summers’s complaint about an oversized stimulus “was what a lot of people were saying privately, what was being whispered by people without his voice or without his platform who were nervous about going public,” said Jason Furman, who was Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers chair and disagrees with Summers’s inflation assessment.

AD

AD

At issue are the risks and opportunities involved in restarting a $20 trillion economy and the unresolved debate over the mistakes made in responding to the 2008 financial crisis.

Summers says the Biden administration’s spending plan was drafted to satisfy political realities rather than economic requirements, and it is courting disaster. The Biden brain trust and other economists, including Paul Krugman, a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, say he’s misreading the moment and overstating the downside risks.

“The discussion he’s trying to push is one we should have,” said Claudia Sahm, a longtime Summers critic and a former Federal Reserve staff economist who is now at the Jain Family Institute. “But it’s so out of proportion. And since [the bill] passed, he’s gotten more and more vicious.”

AD

AD

Summers began warning of economic overheating late last year, criticizing the proposed $2,000 stimulus checks for individual Americans as “bad economics.” When he made that argument, in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion, the idea had already been endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). Biden joined them days later.

Last month, as Congress was considering Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, Summers criticized it in a Washington Post opinion piece as excessive and poorly designed. Too much would be spent sending checks to people who didn’t need the money, while almost nothing would be used to increase the economy’s long-run potential, he said.

Summers acknowledged that the Obama administration hadn’t spent enough to bolster the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. But Biden’s rescue plan would learn that lesson too well, adding too much fuel to an economic fire that would already be raging by the time the money arrived.

AD

AD

The pandemic had punched a roughly $20 billion hole in Americans’ monthly wage income, he said. Biden proposed filling it with more than $100 billion. Coupled with the Federal Reserve’s ultralow interest rates, Washington’s spendthrift ways could send prices soaring.

“I know the bathtub has been too empty,” Summers said. “But one has to think about what the capacity of the bathtub is and how much water we’re trying to flow into it.”

Summers worries that a reopened economy could rev out of control. Either a surge of demand overwhelms producers and sends prices soaring or the Fed will try to prevent that inflationary spike by abruptly hiking interest rates, plunging the economy into a new recession.

AD

There’s only a 1-in-3 chance that the administration enjoys a boom that settles into years of sustainable growth, he said.

AD

“We’re taking substantial risks,” Summers said.

The United States could suffer the sort of price spiral that hasn’t been seen since the late 1960s, when President Lyndon B. Johnson refused to raise taxes to cover the combined costs of his domestic agenda and the Vietnam War, he says. From 1.6 percent in 1965, inflation ticked up to nearly 6 percent five years later.

The architects of Biden’s plan say any inflationary risks pale alongside the damage that could be done to millions of Americans if the administration doesn’t restore a vibrant economy. Spending on roads, bridges and rural broadband networks, which could lift economic growth in the long run, was always envisioned as the second part of a two-step maneuver.

AD

Plus, much of the $1.9 trillion in spending will fill economic holes without adding to demand, such as with government payments to forestall evictions.

AD

“A relief plan is different from a stimulus,” said Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist who served with Summers in the Obama White House.

The economy is likely to run a little hot for about a year, but not as hot or as long as in the late 1990s, he added. Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen both anticipate only a temporary burst of rising prices. Investors likewise anticipate average annual inflation of 2.1 percent starting five years from now, according to one standard market gauge.

AD

“The risk of generalized overheating in the goods market appears low for the time being,” economists at Goldman Sachs told clients this week. A second Goldman study found “no evidence” that pandemics inevitably lead to an increase in inflation.

Others say Summers’s inflation concerns conflict with his calls over the past several years for large-scale government spending to ward off “secular stagnation,” or a permanent shortfall of demand. He denies changing his views, saying instead that by spending $1.9 trillion on short-term needs, the administration may miss the chance to obtain funding for the long-term investment plan that Biden plans to unveil this week.

AD

If they had “been arguing for a $4 trillion stimulus over 10 years to build back America, that would have been fine. I would have been a huge enthusiast for that,” he said.

AD

For Summers, the current dust-up is just the latest chapter in a high-octane career marked by more than its share of personality clashes and contention.

Awarded the prestigious Bates Clark medal, which recognizes economists under the age of 40 who have made the most significant contribution to economic thought, Summers taught at Harvard before becoming chief economist at the World Bank. He served as President Bill Clinton’s treasury secretary during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and was by Obama’s side during the global financial crisis a decade later.

Alongside his acknowledged genius rides a reputation for disregarding social niceties. Some in Washington still recall his public evisceration of economist Emmanuel Saez during a 2019 panel discussion on the wealth tax.

AD

Sarcastic and merciless, Summers criticized Saez’s arguments as “absurd” and called his data “substantially inaccurate and substantially misleading.” The audience at the normally sedate Peterson Institute for International Economics at one point audibly groaned as Summers pounded Saez for flabby thinking.

“Most of Larry’s difficulties in playing well with others had less to do with malice and more to do with obliviousness. For Larry, qualities like tact and restraint just cluttered the mind,” Obama recalled in his memoirs.

Summers’s current position on the sidelines of a Democratic administration is more unusual than uncomfortable. He can still command an audience, and his criticism of the administration, while pointed, does not appear to have burned any bridges.

“They take his substance seriously,” said one prominent Democratic economist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal White House thinking. “Their attitude is not, ‘He’s dead to us.’ They care about his views.”

The White House declined a request to interview a member of the president’s economic team for this story.

Others predict that those views will cost him a seat at the table.

“Nobody can call attention to a topic quite like Larry can,” said Goolsbee. “Sometimes that helps them define an agenda, but sometimes that help comes by defining it in the negative. Given the hostile nature of this argument, I would be surprised if Summers were at the top of the administration’s ‘seeking advice’ list for infrastructure policy ideas or whatever comes next.”

Some liberals say his criticism is the outgrowth of frustrated personal ambition, citing Summers’ failure in 2013 to secure the Fed chairmanship he had long coveted. But his inflation concerns, aired in newspaper columns, are shared by others, including Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.

Furman, a Summers ally, says the former treasury chief has gone overboard with his rhetoric. Earlier this month, Summers said the United States now has “the least responsible macroeconomic policies we’ve had in the last 40 years.” And he irked some administration officials when he wrote that the administration was dismissing “even the possibility of inflation.”

Speaking from the White House podium last month, Jared Bernstein, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, called that assertion “just wrong.”

Summers publicly took himself out of the running for an administration job last summer. But he’s hardly idle. He still teaches at Harvard and sits on the boards of Square, a mobile payments company, and Doma, a San Francisco-based provider of technology designed to simplify real estate closings. He also writes newspaper opinion columns and gives paid speeches.

He says he’s focused on making the most of his multiple outside roles, rather than finding his way back into government.

“All of my plans and expectations are around doing economic analysis and contributing to both the academic and public debate on economic policy,” he said. “And if I’m raising issues that people are feeling a need to think about and grapple with, then I think I’m making a significant contribution.”

With his high-profile inflation forecast, Summers has staked out the “I told you so” terrain if Biden’s plan misfires. But for now, despite his repeated warnings of disaster, policymakers — his friends, mentees and former colleagues — remain unconvinced.",2021-03-29 00:00:00
The ‘brown gold’ that falls from pine trees in North Carolina,"But the reason that longleaf pines are prized around here: their needles.

AD

AD

The dropped needles are in such demand that a lucrative business has grown up around raking, baling and selling them to landscapers and homeowners as mulch. Three varieties of pine needles are farmed, but the discarded debris of a longleaf pine is the most sought-after — and fetches the best price — because of its unusual length and high resin content, making it an attractive, water-retaining ground cover for gardens. Some even call it “brown gold.” And like anything valuable left just lying on the ground, theft is a problem. That’s why North Carolina made it a felony to steal pine needles.

It’s a case of one person’s trash being another person’s treasure — and, in this case, generating an estimated $200 million in annual sales across the Southeast. The pine straw industry, as it’s known, also helps preserve existing longleaf pine forests and supports the creation of new tree stands out of former tobacco fields and peach orchards. The bargain does have an ecological cost. Leaving the pine needles on the ground is ideal.

But increasingly there is support for conservation efforts that acknowledge nature can’t be locked away behind museum glass and allowing that some measured uses can offer protection, such as permitting cattle to graze on prairie lands to keep them open and free of woody vegetation.

“It shows a reasonable compromise between exploitive uses and conservation,” said Jeff Marcus, a scientist with the Nature Conservancy who works on the restoration of North Carolina’s longleaf pine ecosystem.

The ability to profit from pine needles has benefited longleaf pine forests that for decades have been decimated by logging and development.

“You can only sell the timber once. The pine needles come every year,” said Mike Wilson, who runs a pine straw operation here, two hours east of Charlotte.

The numbers just work out better, said Terry Bryant, who runs Pinestar Farms in nearby Carthage.

He could get $4,000 an acre for clear-cutting his mature longleaf pines for timber. Or, he said, he could earn $1,200 an acre collecting pine needles from the same trees — every year.

Farmers sell longleaf pine straw at roadside stalls. Garden stores stock it. Landscapers buy it in bulk. It’s more expensive than wood bark or chips. But it’s preferred as a ground cover because it doesn’t attract termites. Needles from slash and loblolly pine trees are also sold as pine straw. But the longleaf stands out.

AD

One landscaper described his preference by telling Wilson, “I don’t do Bojangles,” referring to the fast-food chicken chain headquartered in North Carolina. Longleaf pine straw, as he saw it, was a higher-end product. It held its color. It was special.

Demand for pine straw has grown over the past two decades, closely following the rate of home building in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and part of Alabama, said Ernest David Dickens, a forestry professor at the University of Georgia who studies the pine straw market.

It’s also been a boon for farmers hoping to hold onto their land.

Wilson, 83, started planting longleaf pine on his family farm — set just a few miles from the famed golf courses at Pinehurst Resort — in the late 1970s. His father and grandfather grew peaches. But the entire crop could be ruined by the slightest changes in the weather. They also tried mining sand, taking advantage of the region’s unusual soil.

Wilson figured he could do better with trees. He now owns more than 750 acres of longleaf pines and leases more, producing up to 170,000 bales of pine straw a year.

The longleaf pine trees on his land are rooted in a mix of neat rows and wild scatter.

“Look at it through there,” Wilson said, driving a dirt road next to a messy thicket of his trees. “That’s all natural regeneration.”

Pine straw is not a quick way to make money. Longleaf pines take a decade to even start producing needles.

Collecting them is tricky.

It’s still done mostly by hand on Wilson’s farm. The needles are raked away from the base of the trees. A lawn tractor with a rake and backpack blowers can help. But a worker still fluffs the pine straw with a pitchfork to shake free any dirt and leaves. Pine cones need to be tossed aside. And the longleaf can produce pineapple-sized pine cones. The cleaned needles then are stuffed into a hand-baling machine, which presses the needles into a wire-bound rectangle.

“Labor is the biggest problem I have,” Wilson said.

His workers are paid by the bale. It’s tough, seasonal work. But they can earn $900 a week, Wilson said. He recalled one notably efficient worker who pulled in $1,400 a week.

As Wilson drove deeper into his property, he came upon Julio Santiago.

Santiago had worked for Wilson for several years. He stood under a thick canopy of longleaf pines, shaded from the afternoon heat. Mariachi music played from a cellphone propped up on a nearby limb. Surrounded by small hills of brown longleaf pine needles, he pushed handfuls into the baler. His wife stood nearby, using a pitchfork to prepare fresh piles for him to bale.

Each bale is worth just $3 to $5. But a trailer stacked with hundreds of bales is a target for thieves. Wilson said he still reminds his workers not leave too many bales sitting out overnight.

AD

AD

A rash of pine-straw thefts more than 20 years ago led Wilson and other pine straw farmers to press for protection. Law enforcement didn’t take the thefts seriously, Wilson said. It was just pine needles. Theft of personal property valued at less than $1,000 was a misdemeanor. But the pine straw farmers eventually persuaded state legislators to make it a felony to steal any amount of pine straw.

It might’ve helped that the pine is North Carolina’s official state tree.

“I think I got the first conviction under that law,” Wilson said.

The market for pine straw has reduced the pressure on landowners to sell longleaf pine for timber or sell out to developers, said Marcus, the scientist with the Nature Conservancy.

“Pine straw makes it a much more financially viable operation for private landowners,” Marcus said.

It’s helped with public lands, too.

Managers of the 33,000-acre Bladen Lakes State Park used to sell logging rights to its old longleaf pines to raise money to run the park.

Now they sell rights to the park’s pine straw instead. That’s allowed the number of mature pine trees to soar, a boost for birds needing old trees for nesting, such as the red-cockaded woodpecker.

It’s not unfettered nature, but it is something close.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Corporations are working with social media influencers to cancel-proof their racial justice initiatives,"The call to action on prime-time television from one of the world’s largest advertisers was risky.

Advocating for racial allyship is not something corporate America has traditionally embraced. But the multiracial protests against police brutality last year prompted many companies to examine their role in combating systemic racism and pushing White Americans to reflect on their understanding of race and privilege — all while trying to increase market share. With every new well-meaning — or opportunistic, depending on the details — effort comes the potential for public and painful missteps.

“We sell Tide,” said Damon Jones, a Procter & Gamble spokesman who leads the company’s racial justice initiatives. “We don’t ever want anyone to be upset at Tide.”

So Procter & Gamble sought outside help to navigate this era of racial justice protests. It joined a growing number of companies consulting diverse panels of “real people” with cultural expertise — community leaders, activists and academics — on everything from ad campaigns to whether to celebrate Black History Month, according to Joshua DuBois, chief executive of Gauge, a technology company connecting corporations with a vast network of social media influencers.

“Traditional market research is not built for this cultural moment,” DuBois said. He and co-founders Brandon Andrews and Alfred Dunn recently launched a “cultural navigator” platform called NXTLAB of more than 10,000 opinion-makers whom companies can tap confidentially for candid feedback to spare themselves possible embarrassment.

AD

Their expertise covers multigenerational, multiracial perspectives on racial equality as well as LGBTQ, gender and women’s rights. Among the platform’s thought leaders: April Reign, who launched the #OscarsSoWhite campaign for more diverse representation in Hollywood; Jamilah Lemieux, a millennial writer focused on race and gender; and David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, a civil rights organization focused on Black LGBTQ people.

The influencers are paid between $500 and more than $1,500 for one-on-one consultations and $10 to $100 for survey responses, DuBois said. Gauge charges companies a subscription fee (starting at $5,000 a month for nonprofit groups) that includes daily emails encapsulating key news developments, access to a website featuring experts weighing in on those moments, and a set number of custom research projects.

The goal, DuBois said, is an “equitable economy for cultural understanding” where leaders of color are paid for helping brands avoid major mistakes in their ad campaigns, corporate policies, diversity and inclusion plans, philanthropy and product launches.

AD

Some firms have been warned against making pronouncements that could be dismissed by consumers as exploitative, DuBois said.

“A couple of companies wanted to launch big Black History Month marketing campaigns and our community said, ‘Do not do that because you haven’t fulfilled what you promised to do after Breonna Taylor and George Floyd,’” DuBois said. “You need to put your money where your mouth is in terms of actual work first.”

No company wants to be canceled, even temporarily. Take Pepsi, whose tone-deaf 2017 ad featuring Kendall Jenner strutting through a protest to deliver a can of soda to a police officer drew consumer backlash and was pulled. Or Starbucks, whose short-lived 2015 campaign for baristas to scrawl “Race Together” on millions of coffee cups in hopes of sparking conversations about racial tensions was criticized as insincere corporatism.

AD

AD

Each marketing misfire provokes a cycle of consumer outrage and calls to boycott, followed by corporate apologies and promises to do better. Instead of being dragged on social media by influencers with large numbers of followers, DuBois said companies can engage them well ahead of any campaign launch.

“These are the people who make good or bad ideas trend, shaping the culture every day,” DuBois said. “It would be a market failure to not tap into this wisdom.”

International makeup chain Sephora convened the NXTLAB network to guide a study on racial bias in retail, and implemented sweeping changes in January to reduce discriminatory practices in its stores and diversify its product lines. Tech company Snap tapped the network to think more deeply about how to develop inclusive augmented reality tools.

They’ve helped corporations featuring Black models and actors in ad campaigns to also consider diversity in size and skin tone. They’ve advised companies on how to show up — even virtually — at events such as last summer’s March on Washington honoring the 57th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” address at the Lincoln Memorial. And they’ve recommended against using the word “Confederate” in television show titles.

“When you can ease someone into a conversation about representation and discrimination, it’s easier than banging someone over the head with it,” said Reign, a trained lawyer turned equity advocate. “Easing someone in can lead to faster results because there is less pushback.”

In 2017, Procter & Gamble received more than 10,000 letters and phone calls, the most “hate mail” the company says it’s ever received, accusing the company of “race baiting” after it released a spot featuring Black mothers directly addressing the racism their children face in American life.

“‘The Talk’ was the first controversial campaign that we did, designed to get people talking about racial bias — bias that exists within the walls of P&G, within the advertising industry, within a lot of different places,” Jones said. “Frankly, when we saw the reaction, we knew we needed to continue that discussion.”

So executives forged ahead with another racially provocative campaign titled “The Look” in 2019.

This time, though, it sought feedback from influencers that Gauge had tapped early on in a beta version of the platform before launching this spring. The racially diverse group helped P&G adjust the intensity of the actors’ facial expressions and emotions. The result: a more subtle film depicting the daily microaggressions experienced by Black men — no matter how accomplished. No words. Just telling glances.

AD

AD

“The challenge was to show the action and the emotion in a true and pure way such that Black men said yes, that’s my experience,” Jones said, “and in a way that White people didn’t get turned off because we were waving the finger and accusing them of being racist.”

“These conversations are so nuanced and our goal is to bring people together,” Jones said. “It is much more layered than just telling the truth.”

The spot listed a company website with online educational resources about racial bias, including a discussion guide, which Jones said P&G created with the help of the Gauge influencers. With the company better prepared for the public reaction than when it released “The Talk,” Jones said P&G was able to launch dozens of community conversations in schools across the nation. “We want to be more effective in drawing people into the discussion rather than just driving people back into their corners,” he said.

AD

Jones said that P&G recognizes that its messaging projected into consumer homes shapes how communities see themselves and each other. That’s why it felt compelled to issue a directive to White people to step up in the fight against racial injustice after Floyd’s killing, when it released “The Choice” online and across major network and cable TV channels.

The emphasis this time was less on blame, he said, but on the fact that everyone has a role to play in fixing societal structures that are biased against Black people. And public reception was much more balanced as more corporations began speaking out about social justice issues, he said.

“The intent was to get the silent majority actively involved,” Jones said. “We didn’t want to just create another ad or film. We needed people to act differently.”

Promoting community discussions and encouraging White Americans to fight for racial justice seems far afield for a company that sells toilet paper, toothpaste and tampons. But for many companies, pressure came from consumers as well as their own employees — and ultimately, they say, standing up for racial justice can help increase their bottom line.

Sonya Grier, an American University professor whose research focuses on race in the marketplace, said corporations have not traditionally advocated for marginalized groups and instead focused on targeting groups most profitable to them.

“They are now trying to support a community so they have sustainability within the marketing systems that they have,” Grier said. “It’s like smoothing the ground in ways to still accomplish the goals they want to accomplish — which is to sell products and make money.”

Black and Hispanic consumers are more likely now to expect brands to take a stance on social justice issues, according to a 2020 Nielsen report. The market research firm has also reported that Black shoppers typically spend more on cosmetics, hair products and skin care than White consumers, amounting to more than $1 billion each year. And Black consumers are more likely than other demographic groups to speak up through social media.

Sephora, which Black shoppers have accused of discrimination, first worked with Gauge experts in 2019 to better understand how Black women leaders view the beauty company and experience racial profiling in retail. They wanted Sephora to sell more representative products, including those reflecting the full array of Black skin tones, and forge relationships with more Black influencers.

Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Yeh said Sephora has since commissioned a panel of equity advisers for quarterly conversations to complement its traditional market research.

When Sephora pledged to devote at least 15 percent of its shelf space to Black-owned beauty brands last summer, Yeh said the equity advisers urged the company to also create a path for Black entrepreneurs by expanding recruiting and ensuring they knew the “secret sauce” to making it onto Sephora shelves.

“The biggest trade show in beauty is in Milan. Are they going to be in Milan? Probably not,” Yeh said. “We are digging much deeper into scouting, beyond just letting them come to us.”

Sephora has re-engineered its six-year-old brand development program — initially created to help women access funding, create prototypes and position their products — to focus exclusively on entrepreneurs of color, with the intent to distribute at Sephora at the end of the six-month boot camp. And it’s tapping some of the equity advisers to act as mentors and to connect with a more diverse group of business owners.

The company has also increased signage in its stores of up-and-coming brands, with mini-profiles of the founders, Yeh said, because “consumers want to know.”

“The speed at which cultural conversations are taking place is breathtaking and the breadth of those conversations are really expanding,” Yeh said. “It’s helpful for us to have a pulse on something that’s broader than what we had in the past.”

Lauryl Schraedly, global head of consumer insights on Snap’s marketing team, said the Gauge network is “unlike anything else in the industry,” something especially valuable at this time because “a lot of people in the market research industry look like me, a White woman.”

Snap began working with the influencers last summer and has sought help understanding which events and issues that brands should be a part of, getting feedback on how people are using its augmented reality filters and staying informed on what various communities care about.

In 2016, the company was pilloried for a Snapchat filter meant to honor Bob Marley that allowed users to put Marley’s face and dreadlocks on themselves and another that turned users into a racist Asian caricature with slanted eyes, buck teeth and a conical hat. Critics said the filters amounted to digital blackface and yellowface.

Last June, it released a controversial filter commemorating Juneteenth, a holiday marking emancipation, that prompted users to smile to break digital chains symbolizing slavery. The company apologized, removed the filter and attributed its error to internal miscommunication.

Two months later, during the March on Washington, Snap unveiled filters and other creative tools designed by Black artists that support Black Lives Matter, including augmented-reality face masks advocating for racial justice that could be also purchased in real life.

After commissioning a study in December on how companies have celebrated Black History Month, Snap in February released a docuseries about 23-year-old Ezekiel Mitchell, a Black cowboy on his journey to becoming the best bull rider in the world. It also rolled out bitmoji celebrating “Black excellence,” including one promoting Black history “24/7/365.”

“We can’t just show up in February and then go silent for the rest of the year,” Schraedly said.

Producing effective campaigns promoting racial justice also helps companies better sell their products, said Jones, of Procter & Gamble. The company is working with Gauge to address systemic bias in the marketing and advertising industry and just launched a campaign to tell more inclusive stories about Black America.",2021-03-30 00:00:00
helping-neighbors-with-disabilities,"Maya Angelou once said, “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.” All of us, including the disabled, of course, can do better in myriad ways. I offer my stories for the able-bodied who are interested in knowing how they can do better by their disabled neighbors.

For instance, years ago I lived in a condominium complex where the only elevator had seemingly sprung to life and acquired a mind of its own, like something out of a 1970s horror film. It frequently conked out, inconveniencing everybody, but leaving me, the only disabled occupant, stranded on the fourth floor.

AD

The other 10 owners knew that I was legally disabled, walked with a cane or walker, and lived 40 feet off the ground. But no one ever thought to let me know when the elevator broke, despite my front door abutting the wily machine.

Because I couldn’t traverse the stairs, when the elevator decided not to work, my day would be totally upended. More than once, I had to cancel plans. My dog, in particular, was not amused.

AD

I emailed the others and asked that they let me know when the elevator was out of service.

I received one response. It read, “Do we have to let you know every time?”

I’ve been disabled by myalgic encephalomyelitis (sometimes known by the misnomer “chronic fatigue syndrome”) for 30 years, later developed Stage 3 thyroid cancer and am rarely self-conscious about either illness.

But the absence of understanding from my neighbors back then left me feeling isolated, like I had the word “disability” emblazoned in neon across my forehead. I was the statistically aberrant one. If my schedule was held hostage to the whims of unpredictable levers and pulleys, well, it was clear that it didn’t matter to them, even after I explained that, by law, the building had to maintain its accessibility. (While the Americans With Disabilities Act doesn’t apply to condo associations, if an owner purchases a unit under the auspices that it’s accessible, the condo association cannot alter or impede accessibility.)

I thought about all this recently when a neighbor in my current building knocked on my door, unprompted, to let me know that the elevator on our side of the building was out of service.

“Thanks so much,” I said. “That was really thoughtful of you.”

“Oh, it’s no big deal,” she replied and smiled. “I just figured you’d need to know.”

We exchanged pleasantries from a safe, masked distance and returned to our respective days, but I was grateful for her insight. She didn’t act as if I wanted special treatment because I’m disabled, but understood that the elevator is my conduit to the outside world. Instead of feeling out of place, I felt at home in my home.

AD

Perhaps even more remarkably, in an era filled with so much pain for everyone, I’ve had the great good fortune to become friends with some of my neighbors, who quickly figured out that I occasionally need physical assistance, but who never lord it over me like I’m their ward.

AD

When Seattle had several days of snow in February, they texted me and said, “Don’t worry about your dog. We’ll walk him for as long as you need. Don’t try going out in the snow.” I was deeply moved by their megawatt dose of kindness because I already knew from experience that snow and my walker make for a dangerous combo.

And because I can’t drive, they’ve shuttled me to two physician appointments across town, saving me a small fortune in car fare. Plus, they’ve left homemade chocolate chip cookies on my doorstep, quite possibly the most helpful act of all.

AD

While I can never reimburse them for their time, I reciprocate where I can because I don’t take advantage of anyone’s good will.

When I head to the pharmacy to pick up prescriptions, I text beforehand to see if they need anything while I’m there.

AD

While I’m out running errands, I’ll pick up slices of gourmet pie from the nearby bakery or doughnuts from a superb little neighborhood outpost. (Yes, all of us eat healthily but, really, you can’t adequately convey gratitude with kale. No one wants to unwrap a salad.)

It’s always a little magical when strangers become friends and over the past year, we’ve found our own rhythm. I know what it’s like to live with able-bodied neighbors who don’t understand or care about disability, so it’s such a welcome change to live with those who genuinely get it. (And who also like dessert.)

A new treatment may halt cluster headaches. But some say psychedelic drugs are the real answer.,"Nothing helped for the first 20 years, until the day the strait-laced, middle-aged construction contractor tried psilocybin — the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms” — an illegal drug he had previously thought “was just for people who fried their brains.” Ever since, Wold, now 65, has relied on periodic low doses of “’shrooms” to keep his excruciating headaches at bay.

Cluster-headache sufferers are renowned among headache doctors for their desperation. ""You'll eat shoe polish if you think it will help,"" one respondent wrote in a survey. Patients call the headaches more painful than childbirth, gunshot wounds and kidney stones. They also commit suicide at about three times the rate of the general population, University of West Georgia psychologist and researcher Larry Schor said.

AD

AD

“The pain is so intense that I’ve had some seemingly psychotic thoughts during attacks,” said Schor, who has suffered from the disorder since 1983. “Like maybe if I could take a pliers and start pulling out molars, or if I hammered in the smallest drill bit near my eye, that could relieve the pressure.”

On average cluster headache sufferers wait more than five years before they are properly diagnosed, after which prescribed drugs often fail and may also have serious side effects, including rebound headaches, which can worsen headache pain, due to medication overuse.

Yet “clusterheads,” as some patients call themselves, today have new reasons to take heart — because of the dogged efforts of Wold and Clusterbusters, an activist group he founded in 2002. The organization has a mailing list with more than 11,000 members and a website with advice on everything from suicide prevention to how to sign up for new clinical trials to how to get discounts on new medications to how to obtain, store and grow magic mushrooms for treatment.

AD

AD

Clusterbusters’ out-of-the-box efforts on behalf of its pain-wracked members are “the stuff of movies,” said Rutgers University sociologist Joanna Kempner, who is writing a book on the group. She compares the clusterheads to the 1980s HIV activists who also boldly experimented with illegal drugs.

“Medicine has ignored these patients for so long that they live in a wild west of treatments,” Kempner said. “They saw the gap in research and did their own research on their own bodies.”

In the process, Clusterbusters has won the hearts — and help — of key allies in academia and the pharmaceutical industry.

Wold and colleagues helped pave the way for the Food and Drug Administration’s 2019 approval of Emgality, an injectable drug that is the first pharmaceutical treatment that can be prescribed to prevent cluster headaches.

AD

AD

The medication deploys a monoclonal antibody to block a protein — calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) — that inflames nerve endings. Eli Lilly originally designed the medication for migraines but devised a higher dose for cluster headaches after interviewing Clusterbusters members, some of whom also participated in its clinical trial, Wold said.

The Clusterbusters’ website hails the Emgality advance as “historical,” but Wold is more excited about new research he hopes will soon confirm his belief that psychedelic drugs can shorten a cluster siege. Later this year, Yale University neurologist Emmanuelle Schindler expects to finish one of the first placebo-controlled studies involving a form of psilocybin to treat cluster headaches.

Schindler not only relied on Clusterbusters to recruit patients for her study but also used key parts of their dosing protocol. After years of self-experiments, many group members believe they have shortened, or “busted,” their clusters with three sub-hallucinogenic amounts of mushrooms spaced five days apart. Schindler is using synthetic psilocybin on a similar schedule, at just 10 milligrams per dose. She said she expects her results to show that “patients know a lot more about their condition and how to treat it than they’re usually given credit for.”

AD

AD

In the patient survey, conducted by Clusterbusters and involving 493 patients recruited from clinics and websites, more than 35 percent of respondents mentioned using “illicit substances.” Based on their responses, Schindler and colleagues suggested that psilocybin and LSD “were comparable to or more efficacious than most conventional medications.”

In 2010, however, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the evidence for oxygen therapy was “promising” but insufficient to support reimbursement. Clusterbusters and other headache advocacy groups have been lobbying the CMS ever since. Wold said the federal agency’s refusal to cover oxygen for Medicare and Medicaid patients has had ripple effects, in that many private insurers are unwilling to reimburse it and doctors are less eager to prescribe it.

AD

AD

Yet he added that the CMS has promised to rule on the advocates’ latest appeal and that he hoped for a breakthrough.

“A lot of things are finally coming together, and it’s really an exciting time,” he said.

Up to 1 in 1,000 people, among them more than 300,000 Americans, endure cluster headaches. That’s close to the number of people with multiple sclerosis, a much more familiar disorder. Cluster headache cases include the British “Harry Potter” actor Daniel Radcliffe and former NFL defensive tackle Terrance “Pot Roast” Knighton, who played for the Washington football team in 2015.

Cluster headaches are sometimes confused with migraines, but there are some important differences. Migraines are about 120 times more common and almost always much less severe. Migraine pain can vary in location, but cluster headaches typically involve just one side of the head. And whereas migraines are three times as common in women as men, cluster headaches are as much as six times more common in men.

AD

AD

Brain scans suggest cluster headaches affect the hypothalamus, trigeminal nerve and autonomic nervous system. The hypothalamus controls your internal clock, so its role may help explain why the headaches usually strike at the same time of day, often as a nasty wake-up call. Scientists suspect the involvement of the hypothalamus may also explain why chronic cluster headache sufferers tend to have more frequent attacks when the days are longest, in July and August, and shortest, in January and February.

The pain itself is caused by dilated blood vessels pressing on the trigeminal nerve. But no one knows what causes the vessels to swell, and doctors are often helpless to offer safe, effective remedies.

Even as some patients hail Emgality, the new preventive drug, as “a godsend” and “life saver,” others complain of an array of downsides including weight gain, hair loss, faintness, joint pain, brain fog and limited benefit.

AD

AD

The psychedelics certainly also have drawbacks.

They don’t work for everyone, and even at low doses shouldn’t be used by people with problems including heart trouble, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Schindler said. The Mayo Clinic warns that LSD can cause “permanent mental changes in perception, rapid heart rate and high blood pressure, tremors, [and] flashbacks, a re-experience of the hallucination — even years later.”

Scientists call magic mushrooms some of the least-toxic and less-addictive recreational drugs, yet some users have reported frightening bad trips, panic, seizures and hospitalizations.

U.S. agencies classify psilocybin and LSD, along with marijuana and heroin, as Schedule I substances, considered to have “high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use . . . and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.”

AD

AD

Despite their risks, however, these drugs, when carefully administered, can help cluster headache patients when nothing else works, some experts said. “LSD and psilocybin are the best we have to offer, although legally we can’t offer them,” psychiatrist John Halpern said.

In 2004, Halpern, then working at Harvard University, was one of the nation’s few researchers studying the medical use of psychedelic drugs. Wold showed him and his colleagues a video of a Clusterbusters member who Wold says was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital because a doctor refused to believe he wasn’t faking his pain.

Halpern decided to help after learning that two staff workers at McLean Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated psychiatric facility, had committed suicide after suffering cluster headaches.

“I wanted to demonstrate that these aren’t drug-seeking individuals but construction workers, lawyers, people from all walks of life yet affiliated in the unluckiest guild of all,” he said. Two years later, he co-wrote a study in Neurology based on interviews with 53 cluster-headache patients who had used psychedelic drugs. Twenty-five of 48 who had used psilocybin and seven of eight who had used LSD reported that the drugs stopped a cluster in its tracks.

Wold’s odyssey in search of relief is familiar to many clusterheads. He was a healthy, 20-something professional, playing football with his young son when he suddenly felt as if his head might explode. The pain vanished after an hour but returned each day over the next few weeks.

For the next 20 years, Wold endured his cycles amid fruitless visits to doctors, until he happened to read an online message by a cluster-headache patient calling himself “Flash” who said he had found relief with LSD. Shortly thereafter, Wold and a few other people he knew began their private experiments with psilocybin.

Today, Wold keeps his headaches under control mainly with oxygen he pays for out-of-pocket and mushrooms he grows with spores ordered online. The Clusterbusters website describes a “medicinal dose” as one gram or less of dried mushrooms, amounting to half of a mild recreational dose. Wold said it feels like he has had a couple of beers.

He added that he is always happy to hear from others helped by Clusterbusters.

“We’re constantly getting thank-you notes from as far away as Romania, saying things like ‘I’ve been using psilocybin for 15 years and it saved my life,’ ” he said. “But we don’t really care what people find that’s going to help them. Whatever path they choose, we’re just trying to make it easier and safer.”

The battle over psychedelic treatments

Researchers who study cluster headaches face daunting obstacles. The disorder is so rare that patients are hard to track down, particularly during an attack, while the pain may deter them from traveling to research sites.

Add psychedelic treatments to the mix and recruiting is even harder because many people are unwilling to try even low doses of these drugs. (In the lab, risks are minimized, Yale University neurologist Emmanuelle Schindler said, because patients are carefully screened, prepared and observed. If such treatments ever become legal, doctors presumably would take on these tasks.)

Yet another obstacle for researchers investigating psychedelics is the lack of ready money from pharmaceutical firms, funders of most modern drug studies.

“No one wants to pay for something you can grow in your basement,” one scientist said.

In recent years, however, private philanthropists have come to the rescue.

Schindler’s study of a form of psilocybin to treat cluster headache was largely supported by Carey Turnbull, a New York-based philanthropist and former financial services entrepreneur.

In an interview, Turnbull estimated that he has donated roughly $10 million for research into psychedelic drugs, calling them “the most astonishing probes of mood and cognition, which not only lead to mystical experiences but help alleviate terribly disabling neurological problems.”

Scientists running experiments with psychedelic drugs must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration, in addition to getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration. They’ve also faced considerable stigma, although that is starting to change.

Research on psilocybin and other hallucinogens is in a renaissance following a four-decade lull. Many among the 127 studies of psilocybin published in 2020 suggest promise in treating mental disorders, such as anxiety, depression and anorexia nervosa.

Laws are also starting to change.

The use, sale and possession of the drug remains illegal under federal law. Yet in recent years, the cities of Denver, Oakland and Santa Cruz, Calif., and Somerville, Mass., have decriminalized it. Last November, Oregon became the first state, by referendum, to make psilocybin legal for therapeutic use. Oregon has also decriminalized psilocybin and LSD, although LSD remains illegal under both federal and state law everywhere else.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"As telehealth visits become more common, here are ways you can make the most of your consultation","In prepandemic times, a worrying symptom would have meant a long wait to see a doctor in person at an office or a visit to urgent care. But with telemedicine’s growing popularity and easy access, this patient and others can now book a quick ­15-minute video visit with a doctor to get some peace of mind when we all could use it.

One in 3 adults below age 65 have used telehealth during the pandemic. While telehealth has its advantages, it has some drawbacks, too. Even the most brilliant physician cannot listen to your lungs through a webcam or make a diagnosis when a poor connection cuts off every other word. Whether it’s your first consultation or for long-term care, here’s how to make the most of any telehealth visit.

Anytime, anywhere

With medical appointments available anywhere with reliable Internet connection — and some services such as Teladoc available 24/7 — scheduling ones for follow-ups, preventive care and non-urgent questions is more convenient than before. A new patient in my clinic had gained over 100 pounds of excess water weight as a side effect of heart valve problems, but she had been scared to come into the clinic during the pandemic. A telemedicine appointment and a scale could have helped us address the problem much sooner.

Check your tech

Because of patient privacy laws, health systems may use proprietary videoconference systems that operate differently from consumer applications. Test that the system works on your device — that you can log into your account, check into the appointment, and join the call with high-quality video and audio. Don’t do a virtual visit while commuting — choose a quiet, private place with no TV or radio in the background. Consider using earphones. Lighting should be in front of you. Use landscape mode for better visibility. Plug in devices or charge them beforehand. Hiccups can still happen in good conditions, something my deaf patient, her American Sign Language interpreter and I discovered when the video froze at inopportune times during our conference call.

Manage time well

Create an agenda: Start the appointment by listing issues, then ask your doctor if there’s anything the physician would like to add. As a favor to a colleague, I squeezed a new patient into the only available 15-minute slot. He wanted to address new chest pain, high blood pressure and diabetes. Having this list helped me clarify that we’d only have time to thoroughly assess the chest pain, but would examine the other two properly in a follow-up visit.

Be very detailed

The lack of a physical exam means that the most valuable thing you can do is catalogue your symptoms very well. Take good notes and clear, well-lit photos of visible symptoms such as rashes or bruises. It is rare for me to meet patients who can confidently recount all the details I’m going to ask about if they haven’t written some of them down. And the less time spent on data gathering, the more time can be spent on finding solutions.

AD

Almost all doctors use one of two standardized note-taking systems: the history and physical (H&P) or the subjective, objective, assessment and plan (SOAP). Both are designed to concisely communicate a patient’s history, exam findings and plan of care to the entire medical team.

The mnemonic that many medical students learn, and that I still use every time I interview patients, is OLDCARTS. When a friend called with coronavirus concerns, we listed her symptoms of fatigue, fevers and shortness of breath. Then, we organized her thoughts before a telehealth visit with her physician:

Onset (When did symptoms begin?): Fatigue and fevers, three days ago. Shortness of breath and chest pain, 24 hours ago.

AD

Location (Where is the symptom?): Pain between the ribs.

Duration (Is it episodic? How long do they last?): The pain, fever and fatigue have been constant.

AD

Characteristics: Felt short of breath when walking up the stairs, but for the past few hours also while walking on level ground.

Aggravating Factors (What makes it worse?): It gets worse with deep breaths or when I push between my ribs.

Relieving Factors: Pain improves if I’m sitting down or not exerting myself.

Treatments: Took some Tylenol, didn’t help.

Severity: On a scale of 1-10, the pain is a 2. The shortness of breath is like jogging a few hundred feet.

Since the chest pain was musculoskeletal, it was probably soreness from heavy breathing rather than something more ominous. Knowing fever and fatigue clearly preceded shortness of breath meant that the culprit was probably a viral illness rather than a potentially life-threatening blood clot in the lungs. The preciseness of the symptom severity and timeline allowed her doctor to list specific changes that would warrant a trip to the emergency room, if they occurred. Fortunately, she felt better the next day.

AD

AD

Doctors do this, too. If I am a patient seeing a new doctor for the first time, I’ll make sure to provide my medical history. I always have this in an electronic form, so that it’s ready to be emailed if requested. Ask your doctor if it would be helpful to send it along before the appointment.

Research this, not that

Search engines can answer broad questions that apply to the general population, such as “Who can get vaccinated right now?” Use time with your doctor to navigate your unique circumstances: “Since I have rheumatoid arthritis, do I meet the immunocompromised criteria to be vaccinated early?”

Speaking for the entire medical profession, please don’t search the whole Internet for your symptoms. There are better resources such as UpToDate, a subscription-based encyclopedia of articles written by doctors for doctors, and one of the most-used medical references at the top 20 hospitals on the U.S. News & World Report’s rankings. Ask your doctor if there’s a “for patients” article pertinent to your situation, which can be an excellent way to understand what might happen next and why certain tests are ordered.

""Is that your final answer?""

I rarely think to tell patients how complex their issues are, yet it’s sometimes the most useful thing they hear from me in the entire visit. Some of the best questions you can ask your doctors are how certain they are about the cause of your symptoms and the next steps, whether the issue is complex or atypical, and whether the plan of care is widely accepted, highly controversial, or a complete judgment call because guidelines don’t exist.

AD

AD

Before hanging up, ask your doctor if they felt that they had enough time to evaluate the issue.

Discovering a diagnosis, managing symptoms, dealing with relapse — these are all roads best traveled together. At a time when many of us yearn for such kinship, telemedicine can make it easier to be in lockstep with your physician. These tips will better the journey.",2021-04-02 00:00:00

The Washington Nationals can keep the coronavirus from ruining their season,"Also, it’s tough luck that five other Nats are in quarantine because of close contacts with the infected four.

But it is important to note the limits of the problem the Nats face. It’s true this virus outbreak could be the start of a disastrous season, especially against a tough schedule in April. But it doesn’t have to be. At least if there are no more cases, which isn’t guaranteed.

AD

AD

The Nats got a tough break that may be nobody’s fault. But now they must avoid another potential problem: feeling sorry for themselves.

“We’ll see if we start fast or not,” said Rizzo, immediately rejecting the premise that they wouldn’t. Last season, the Nats lost star Juan Soto for the first eight games to a positive virus test. They went 5-3 without him. But this is an outbreak, not a one-off.

“That’s why you build depth,” Rizzo said.

Then, mentioning all the struggles of the first 50 games of 2019, Rizzo said that, when a roster takes hits, “Your stars have to be stars. And our depth has to shine.”

If this were the NFL, I’d dismiss this as “happy talk.” But baseball is fundamentally different. In small data samples, the difference between players is not large, and no one knows, for a week or two, who’ll be hot or not.

AD

AD

Nonetheless, the word “crisis,” which Rizzo used, is appropriate for a team that faces 17 of 22 games the rest of April against teams predicted to be winners.

Their first three-game series of the season has been canceled. Those games against the Mets were the first time the Nats could have played at home before their own fans — albeit just 5,000 of them — since winning the 2019 World Series. That is yet another psychological downer for this bunch that never seems to get to celebrate Washington’s best baseball moment since 1924.

Even more stunning to the Nats — they now may need to bring up about nine minor leaguers, some of whom probably will fill key roles, in the team’s first week or so.

AD

We already know that a catcher (Tres Barrera), an infielder (Luis García), a left-handed hitting outfielder (Yadiel Hernandez) and a lefty pitcher (Sam Clay) have been summoned. There will be more, perhaps prospect Carter Kieboom and pitchers Kyle McGowin and Ryne Harper, who had good springs.

Playing with nine men who were sent to the minors is bad. But it is not as bad as it seems. And it is not as bad, in terms of losing games and burying a season before it has begun, as it would be in other sports.

AD

This is counterintuitive. But the difference between one MLB player and another is not as great as many fans believe. That was proved to me twice, both times by the Nats in their building years when they had teams designed to lose a lot — and get high draft picks — in 2007 and 2010.

AD

In 2010, their pitching leaders in games started were Liván Hernández, John Lannan, Craig Stammen, Luis Atilano, Scott Olsen and Jason Marquis. Their only all-star, closer Matt Capps, was traded at the deadline. Yet they went 69-93.

But that spunky bunch could not touch the ’07 team whose top starting pitchers were Matt Chico, Jason Bergmann, Mike Bacsik, Shawn Hill, Tim Redding, Jason Simontacchi, Joel Hanrahan and Micah Bowie. Remember Levale Speigner? The only Nat with 75 RBI or 20 homers was Ryan Zimmerman.

In essence, they were a team with at least 20 “replacement players” — guys you can get at almost no cost with a phone call, probably to your minor leagues. Yet both those teams took pride in being disrespected and the ’07 club went 73-89 and avoided even 90 loses. If they could maximize their minimal talent for six months, why shouldn’t these Nats make do for a week or two?

AD

AD

Even the sacred stat of the moment, WAR (Wins Above Replacement), shows how little difference there is between a star and that “call-up” player in the short term.

If the value of the nine players the Nats must now subtract is huge — say a combined WAR of 20 over 162 games — that is still a difference of just two extra wins in 16.2 games.

Though nothing is certain, the Nats probably will not be losing their affected players for anything close to 16 days. A quarantined player could get out after as few as seven days under MLB protocols. And a player with a positive test can be eligible again after 10 days. Yes, there are hoops to jump through with local regulations and consecutive negative test and such. But that gives a ballpark range.

AD

The first “positive” Nats player was testedMonday. The Nats discovered they had a positive test problem late Tuesday night, after flying to D.C. Monday evening, and have not had a team-together activity since.

AD

So by the time the Nats open their season — at the earliest Monday — they will not have been together, and with many in quarantine, for all of Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. If they succeed in playing their three-game series with Atlanta next week, they’ll have another travel day Thursday. By the time they meet the Dodgers in L.A., the affected players, at last in theory, will have been isolated for nine days — while missing just three games.

AD

Ironically, the Nats broke camp Monday in as close to perfect health as they have in their D.C. incarnation with only reliever Will Harris recovering from injury. And he was due to start throwing again soon.

The Nats will be tempted to think they have been hit by an avalanche. But they have depth, so long as too many of the missing nine aren’t all at the same position. Ryan Zimmerman can’t even get in the lineup after being the hottest hitter in Florida. García and Kieboom are genuine prospects. As sixth and seventh starters go, Erick Fedde and Austin Voth are reassuring. Catchers Yan Gomes and Alex Avila are interchangeable. Outfielder Andrew Stephenson has hit .366 in limited call-ups the past two seasons. He’s dying for a chance.

Baseball never seems to stop giving us things we’ve never seen, and solutions we’ve never imagined. What would happen to an NFL team that had to replace 40 percent of its roster just as the season began?

Maybe the coronavirus will blow a hole in the hull of the Nats that leads to a rapidly sinking ship.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
MLB’s move of the All-Star Game from Georgia simply favors democracy,"“Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,” Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.

AD

Read that sentence again. What American, regardless of political party or race or creed or religion — left or right, Black or White, Christian or Jew, vegan or carnivore, Yankees or Red Sox — can disagree with that? We are a democracy. Decisions in a democracy are made by the will of the people. Not some of the people. All of the people. This didn’t used to be a point of contention, and that’s not some woke mob point of view. It’s just American.

AD

It’s healthy to scrutinize the people who oversee sports and work for the owners of franchises who try to profit from them. Yet if baseball is still somehow woven into the fabric of America — if it’s still uniquely of this country, even as it grows more diverse and global — then its leaders have an obligation to acknowledge that every eligible American citizen should have the easiest opportunity to cast a ballot, regardless of the level of election.

This fits, too, the sport’s rather rapid evolution with regards to race relations, a change not even a year in the making. Baseball has a generation-old problem of declining Black participation. Frankly, it too often feels like a White sport injected with Latin American flavor. The NBA, with a largely Black labor force, finds it easier to lead on issues involving race and equality.

AD

Then, last spring’s killing of George Floyd under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin — an event that roiled the country and continues to remain in the moment because of Chauvin’s trial — emboldened baseball’s Black players to speak out and fostered conversations the sport had too seldom had.

AD

Baseball clubhouses tend to lean right, often heavily. Yet the lasting images of a summer of unrest throughout the sport include the New York Mets and Miami Marlins laying a No. 42 jersey — the number worn by Jackie Robinson — at home plate before the two teams walked off the field as a sign of unity and protest. They include veteran Black players Curtis Granderson, Dee Strange-Gordon and Cameron Maybin forming the Players Alliance, aimed at creating more opportunities in Black communities. They include the impassioned words of countless players — Tim Anderson of the Chicago White Sox, Dominic Smith of the Mets, on and on — talking frankly and jarringly about what it’s like to grow up Black in the United States.

That all mattered, and it had to be factored into MLB’s thinking on the Atlanta All-Star Game. It all helped strengthen the idea that athletes and leagues shouldn’t remove themselves from the discussion. They should help lead it. That those voices and images still resonate could be the lasting impact of 2020’s coronavirus-shortened baseball season. At least something good came of it.

It’s important to note, contrary to the repeated claims of President Biden — false claims — that the new Georgia rules do not shorten the hours that polls are open. Indeed, they even expand the opportunity to cast early ballots in some counties.

But to hide behind those realities is to ignore the fact that Georgia’s state board of elections can now seize control of ballot counting from local authorities. It’s to ignore the limits on ballot drop boxes that make them all but irrelevant. It’s to discount the dismissal of mobile voting centers that can help ease the burden at overcrowded polling spots and encourage people to vote.

“The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion,” the Braves said in a statement.

Uh, how would that have worked, exactly?

In their statement, the Braves lamented the economic losses of MLB’s decision.

“Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision,” the club said.

Left unsaid: The oppressive new voting restrictions create victims across the state. That they would be disproportionally Black is also unsaid — and intended. Take into account the roots of these new laws — the conspiracy theories surrounding November’s presidential election that suggested widespread fraud when there was, in fact, none — and consider that they’re designed to prevent what happened then, which was Georgia turning blue.

This move by MLB says, quite clearly, that there are consequences for the businesses, the employees and the fans of a given state or city based on the actions of its leaders. The discussion is furthered by moving the game, not by keeping it there.

There is precedent here. In 1990, Arizona voters shot down a ballot initiative that would have established Martin Luther King Jr. Day as an official holiday. In March 1991, the NFL’s owners voted to move Super Bowl XXVII, set for January 1993, from the state.

And lo and behold, what happened? In 1992, Arizonans recognized the holiday. And the state now hosts Super Bowls.

After trying to avoid taking sides in the political debate, corporations of all varieties have begun finding neutrality impossible, and this week has seen an avalanche of statements from executives, including Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, who described the bill as “wrong” and “a step backward.”

On Friday afternoon, MLB became the latest significant entity to take a position.

“Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views. I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB Draft,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.

“Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,” he added. “We proudly used our platform to encourage baseball fans and communities throughout our country to perform their civic duty and actively participate in the voting process. Fair access to voting continues to have our game’s unwavering support.”

Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, one of the two Black managers in the majors, said he supported the move.

“I’m not completely versed on everything, but my takeaway from the bill was essentially to suppress voting for people of color,” Roberts said. “And that’s something I fundamentally and intrinsically disagree with.”

Support for the move was not universal around baseball, particularly in Atlanta, where the Braves quickly issued a statement saying they were “deeply disappointed” in the decision.

AD

“This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city. The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion,” the statement read. “Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community. Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.”

Georgia lawmakers and public figures expressed anger, disappointment and approval Friday in their responses to the announcement.

Freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said MLB needed to “stop listening to their corporate communist sponsors and remember the little guys who buy their tickets.""

AD

“Keep the politics off the field and stop ruining everything!” she tweeted.

Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) threatened MLB’s antitrust exemption in his tweet.

“In light of @MLB’s stance to undermine election integrity laws, I have instructed my staff to begin drafting legislation to remove Major League Baseball’s federal antitrust exception,” he wrote.

Even Democrats have been unable to agree on the role corporations should take in protesting the law. In an interview with ESPN on Wednesday night, Biden said he would “strongly support” moving the game from Atlanta after the passage of the law he referred to as “Jim Crow on steroids.”

AD

Former candidate for Georgia governor and voting rights champion Stacey Abrams had mixed feelings about the move.

“Disappointed @MLB will move the All-Star Game, but proud of their stance on voting rights,” Abrams tweeted. “GA GOP traded economic opportunity for suppression.”

AD

Abrams added that she urged events and productions to “come & speak out or stay & fight” on behalf of people of color who now stood to lose wages because of boycotts.

Newly elected Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), who released a statement Thursday opposing boycotts as a response to the law, blamed Republicans for hurting the state’s economy.

“The leadership of Georgia’s Republican Party is out of control and Georgia is hemorrhaging business and jobs because of their disastrous new Jim Crow voting law,” Ossoff said in the statement. “The Governor and the legislature are deliberately making it harder for Black voters to vote. They know it. Everybody knows it and this egregious and immoral assault on voting rights has also put our state’s economy at grave risk.”

AD

MLB suspended all political donations after the Jan. 6 Capitol invasion, but the decision to move the All-Star Game still constitutes a surprise.

AD

Relative to other professional sports leagues such as the NBA and the WNBA, baseball has avoided placing itself at the center of politicized issues. Last year, MLB deviated from that course with its decision to paint a tribute to Black Lives Matter on the back of its pitcher’s mounds in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd — a small but noticeable statement from largely White MLB, which has struggled to build appeal and a sense of belonging for Black players in recent years.

Moves such as the All-Star Game relocation have a history of making a difference. The NFL originally awarded the 1993 Super Bowl to Arizona, aware that the state would be voting on whether to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a paid holiday in November 1990. When the measure did not pass, NFL owners voted to move the game.

AD

“Proud to call myself part of the @mlb family today @morethanavote #BlackLivesMatter,” tweeted NBA star LeBron James, who was active and outspoken in support of voting rights ahead of the November election and officially joined the ownership group of the Boston Red Sox this week.

AD

James and Michael Tyler led athletes last year in forming the voting rights advocacy group More Than a Voter. Tyler said the financial impact of the All-Star Game “will be real” but noted that boycotts from other corporations over a long period of time probably would be more devastating than losing a few days of events.

“This is the single greatest example we have right now to demonstrate to lawmakers who are considering these bills in other states — states like Texas, Florida and Arizona — that, as they consider these rules, their actions will be met consequences,” said Tyler, who helped players and organizers use last month’s NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta as a chance to voice opposition to bills they felt would restrict voting rights.

AD

“A boycott is clearly a suboptimal situation,” he added. “In a perfect world, these kind of measures wouldn’t be necessary at all.”

MLB has not announced a replacement venue. The Dodgers were supposed to host the game last year but missed their assigned turn when it was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. MLB assigned the 2022 game as a replacement but could decide to turn to Los Angeles, which probably will be more prepared than a city that hadn’t been expecting to host.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Jordan McNair’s father hopes a bill named for his son gives athletes a greater voice,"“You want to honor your child, you want to honor his legacy — however, you want to honor his legacy [in a way] that’s consistent with the work that we do,” said Martin McNair, who with Wilson established the Jordan McNair Foundation to raise awareness about the signs and symptoms of heatstroke and heat-related illnesses. Martin McNair also wrote a memoir detailing the life and loss of his son.

AD

AD

“Our mission is to promote awareness, education and prevention of heat-related injuries but also to empower student-athletes,” he said.

The legislation would make Maryland the latest state to enable its college athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses while also implementing greater safety measures to prevent the failures that led to Jordan McNair’s death.

McNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman, died in June 2018 after the Maryland medical staff failed to properly treat him after he suffered exertional heatstroke during a team workout. In January, state officials approved a $3.5 million settlement between the school and McNair’s family.

The family became involved with the Jordan McNair Safe and Fair Play Act in 2019, when Martin McNair read a news story about then-Del. Shelly Hettleman’s legislation that sought to create an avenue through which college athletes could report concerns about their program to the administration — circumventing the athletic department in the process. It was meant to help avoid an outcome similar to Jordan’s.

AD

AD

McNair reached out to Hettleman (D), whose district included Jordan’s old high school. They started a conversation that came to include Del. Brooke Lierman (D), who in February 2019 had proposed a bill seeking to give athletes the right to unionize and collectively bargain over issues related to health and safety.

“This was the sort of story that every parent was talking about for some time if they were at all following college athletics,” Lierman said of McNair’s death. “As a legislator who has frequent interactions with the university system leadership, to see something like this be allowed to happen, everything went wrong. And as a parent, it was your worst nightmare.”

Lierman and Martin McNair continued to exchange ideas. She asked what he would like to add and what he thought about certain aspects of the bill. He twice testified at the Maryland State House.

AD

AD

Those conversations helped expand Maryland’s Safe and Fair Play Act, which would allow the state’s college athletes to profit off their names, images and likenesses. It would compel colleges to implement guidelines to prevent and treat serious sports injuries, including brain trauma and heat-related illnesses. It also would require colleges to develop return-to-play protocols for players coming back from injury. Lierman said she expects it could be signed into law by the end of May.

While Maryland seeks to bolster athletes’ rights and protections, the NCAA has faced mounting pressure for the ways it has limited those very things.

The NCAA’s argument that it is protecting the integrity of amateur athletics by opposing greater compensation for players was met with skepticism at the Supreme Court on Wednesday. During this year’s NCAA tournaments, the organization has come under fire for the differences in how it treats men’s and women’s athletes. Its restrictions on players’ ability to monetize their names, images and likenesses already have been challenged by states such as California and Florida; the latter’s law allowing college athletes in the state to make money from endorsements goes into effect in July. And a group of men’s basketball players resurfaced those concerns last month while using the hashtag #NotNCAAProperty.

AD

AD

The blend between economic empowerment and player safety may seem a bit incongruent, but McNair saw a natural union when he reflected on his time with Jordan. During his son’s 19 years, McNair said he taught Jordan everything he knew. He taught him how to be coachable, how to defend himself and how to speak up around his peers. But he never taught him that “if you don’t feel comfortable doing something from an adult or a coach, don’t do it.”

Through its safety measures and expanded financial freedoms, he hopes the bill will empower other athletes to exercise that independence as universities are held more accountable.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
Chris Paul and the Phoenix Suns are surging as NBA playoffs near,"Chris Paul’s former teams have missed him once he’s gone, too. The future Hall of Fame point guard’s 2017 exit from the Los Angeles Clippers led to the franchise’s first lottery appearance in seven seasons. The Houston Rockets’ 2019 trade of Paul for Russell Westbrook set into motion a two-year collapse that will require years of rebuilding. Oklahoma City’s decision to trade Paul in November has achieved its intended effect for both sides: Paul’s arrival has catapulted the Phoenix Suns up the Western Conference standings, while the Thunder is headed for a tank.

AD

AD

This has been a fascinating odyssey for the 35-year-old Paul, who continues to earn all-star selections and defy doubts about his advancing age. He transformed the Clippers into perennial contenders, helped the Rockets achieve the best record in franchise history and turned the Thunder into last year’s biggest overachiever. But each stop ended in a different flavor of heartbreak, leaving Paul to keep moving in search of a playoff breakthrough that has eluded him for 16 seasons.

After a series of disappointments with the Clippers, Paul finally reached the conference finals for the first time with the 2018 Rockets, only to come up injured midway through the series. His 2019 playoff run ended early amid tension with James Harden, and he fell just short of leading the Thunder to an upset of the Rockets in the first round at the Disney World bubble.

In Phoenix, Paul has a well-balanced, unselfish team that will enter the postseason with one of the league’s best records but with relatively little pressure. The Suns’ 140-103 throttling of the Thunder on Friday was their fifth straight victory, and it improved their record to 34-14, good for the West’s second seed. That win helped the Suns match their total from last season, when they went 34-39, and they will soon clinch their first winning season since 2013-14 and their first playoff appearance since 2010.

AD

AD

Paul, who is averaging 16 points, 4.7 rebounds and 8.7 assists, has sounded like a happy camper in recent weeks, praising his youthful team’s “spirit,” dedication and off-court chemistry. Coach Monty Williams has noticed an added degree of maturity this season after an unexpected 8-0 run in the bubble.

“One of the things I look for in a group is remorse after a loss,” Williams said following a bounce-back win earlier this season. “We all feel like … you know what. Food doesn’t taste good. Your sleep isn’t the same. You’re overthinking. To me that’s a great sign that guys really care. We have that kind of team.”

Thanks to excellent health for their key players, the Suns are second in point differential, seventh in offensive efficiency and sixth in defensive efficiency. They play steady, deliberate and intelligent basketball, with Paul orchestrating an offense that gets key contributions from Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges, all of whom are under 25.

AD

AD

Booker, a two-time all-star guard who is averaging 25.6 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.5 assists, has formed a mutually beneficial relationship with his new backcourt partner. The duo has helped Phoenix improve across the board, including in late-game situations. Last year, the Suns went 16-21 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. This year, they are 14-11.

“That’s a sign of a team that’s growing,” Paul said after a tight win over the Portland Trail Blazers last month. “The best teams in the league don’t always play great all game long, but when it’s winning time, you lock in and you lock down. We’re doing that.”

In light of the Suns’ surge up the standings, TNT commentator Charles Barkley has floated Paul as a dark-horse MVP candidate, and Williams is sure to get plenty of Coach of the Year votes. But how this feel-good story ends remains to be seen, and the Suns are likely to be a popular upset pick if they claim home-court advantage in the first round.

AD

AD

Paul will need to scale up his minutes considerably in the playoffs, and he will be counting on several key players — including Booker, Ayton and Bridges — who have never reached the postseason. What’s more, Williams is seeking the first playoff series victory of his seven-year head coaching career.

In a worst-case scenario, the Suns could face the Lakers in the first round, should the defending champions slip in the standings with James and Anthony Davis out injured. Even if Phoenix avoids that land mine, its reward for a dream season could be Luka Doncic’s Dallas Mavericks, Damian Lillard’s Trail Blazers or Stephen Curry’s Warriors.",2021-04-03 00:00:00
"Capitals snap two-game skid, beat Devils in overtime","The 2-1 win left the Capitals (24-9-4, 52 points) alone atop the East division and snapped a two-game losing streak.

AD

""I just got the puck, and I tried to skate and see what was open up and . . . just tried to shoot it,"" Orlov said. ""We needed that win. Great response after two losses, so we have a good game. . . . We just have to build on that. . . . I think 19 games left, and that is not a lot of time, so we have to get better every game.""

AD

Vanecek saved 22 of the 23 shots the Devils sent his way — including a handful of stunning saves in overtime.

“Obviously, those are huge saves, and those are behind-the-scenes saves that really lead to the goal that we scored,” Nick Jensen said of Vanecek’s overtime performance. “But he’s kind of like the Secret Service back there. When we score, he doesn’t get a lot of attention, but that’s a big part of why we win those overtime games because he’s making saves like that.”

AD

The Capitals, playing their second game in as many nights, appeared to fix the defensive miscues that plagued them Thursday night in an 8-4 loss to the New York Islanders at Nassau Coliseum. It helped that Vanecek was on his game, improving to 15-6-3.

“We played hard,” Laviolette said. “[Thursday’s loss] was a different type of game. I really like the fact that we bounce back. It was a back-to-back situation against a team that was fresh. I thought we did a good job on the compete level. It was real strong defensively. It was certainly a much quieter game, not as much noise coming back our way. It was a good response.”

Laviolette shook up his lineup after Thursday’s loss, scratching Jakub Vrana for the first time since April 5, 2018. Richard Panik was inserted back into the lineup after sitting the previous two games.

AD

AD

Laviolette said the decision to sit Vrana, who has gone 11 games without a goal, did not stem from just his recent lack of production. There have been many conversations between Vrana and the coaching staff since the start of the season about his game. Vrana, who is in the final year of a two-year, $6.7 million contract, has 10 goals and 13 assists in 35 games.

“He is a very skilled player,” Laviolette said before the game. “But there are also other aspects of the game that are very important. And through many conversations through the course of the year so far with Jakub, we’re looking for a higher level of play.

“Sometimes coming out of the lineup and taking a minute and maybe watching a game can reignite a fire inside of his game and start to push him in the right direction.”

AD

With Vrana out, Laviolette also tinkered with his lines, pushing Evgeny Kuznetsov to the fourth line with Panik and Daniel Sprong. Lars Eller took over top-line center duties next to Alex Ovechkin and T.J. Oshie. Ovechkin finished with a team-high 10 shot attempts, six of which were on net, but could not light the lamp.

AD

The game stayed scoreless until John Carlson continued his run of strong play with his third goal in two games, a long-range blast that appeared to handcuff Blackwood.

Michael McLeod answered for the Devils a little more than four minutes later, scoring on a rebound off a shot from Jesper Boqvist that bounced off Vanecek’s pad.

It stayed deadlocked at 1 after a third period that saw Vanecek and Blackwood take center stage. The Devils netminder was busy all night, with the Capitals putting 40 shots on goal.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Rui Hachimura has found his ‘senpai’ in Russell Westbrook,"Others slap palms to kick off choreographed greetings. Some leap for chest bumps. Hachimura and Westbrook’s handshake — a loose use of the term here — is gentler. The pair bow to each other.

AD

“It was a long time ago. When we started playing together, I think it was from him,” Hachimura said this week, recalling the origins of the handshake. “He just wanted to bow like that … I was calling him senpai, which means like, in Japan, it’s what we always call older people, like in a respect way. He’s a leader, and I look to him; I like to play with him. It’s fun.”

Hachimura and Westbrook’s connection isn’t just on display during player introductions these days; it plays out all over the court and has led to some of Hachimura’s best highlights. The forward’s angry slam over Detroit’s Isaiah Stewart on March 27 came off a crafty bounce pass from Westbrook just inside the arc. So too did Hachimura’s one-handed dunk three days later against the Charlotte Hornets — this time, he collected a ball Westbrook heaved near half court.

Hachimura, the No. 9 overall pick in 2019, is playing with more force and better court awareness in the past 11 games, and, save an uninspired outing against Detroit on Thursday in which not a single member of Washington’s roster played well, his numbers have followed.

AD

AD

Hachimura is averaging 19.3 points, shooting 52 percent from the field and averaging 7.3 rebounds over that span. It’s a noticeable uptick from his season average of 14.2 points, 47.9 percent shooting and 5.8 rebounds over 40 games.

The 23-year-old has spoken about a change in his mentality this season, his willingness to step up when Bradley Beal is sidelined, as he has been for the past three Wizards games with a hip contusion. He is clearly less hesitant on court, hunting for open midrange jumpers that are available with Beal not there to take them and more aggressively finishing at the rim.

But when asked about his progress this season, Hachimura without fail credits Westbrook, the veteran nine years his senior.

AD

“I think it’s all because of Russ, you know,” Hachimura said. “He always gets attention, especially offensively. He always has the ball, he’s a great playmaker, and he always gives us good opportunities. … Since last year, I think that’s the difference for me to make an easy score, a dunk.”

AD

There are two primary ways Wizards Coach Scott Brooks sees Westbrook directly affecting Hachimura’s game.

The first is off-court and has to do with confidence. Brooks sees Westbrook injecting Hachimura with self-belief through pep talks that are potent because Hachimura admired Westbrook before they became teammates. But the point guard, as is his nature, is also demanding.

AD

“He’s always challenging [Hachimura]: ‘C’mon man, you’ve got to do it every night. You’ve got to do it every day. You’ve got to do it every film session,’ ” Brooks said, quoting Westbrook. “ ‘You’ve got to do it every timeout. You’ve got to do it every halftime — you’ve got to lock in.’ Every game. That’s something that doesn’t show on the stat sheet.”

What does crop up in the team’s analytics is the pair’s on-court connection. With Westbrook streaking in on the majority of possessions to grab rebounds (he leads the Wizards with 10.3 per game), Hachimura can get a head-start running back downcourt in transition, where the 6-foot-8 power forward often has a size advantage over the guards parked at the other end.

AD

The result is Hachimura’s recent uptick in dunks — the type of energy-creating buckets that then fuel the young player’s confidence like a feedback loop.

“You can see the last five games [there] have been more,” Brooks said this week. “Russell’s throwing it over the top, smalls are in jail. [Hachimura] gets in 'em, puts it in the basket. That’s what we need to do. They’ve got good synergy lately.”

AD

Hachimura’s step toward becoming the more aggressive centerpiece the Wizards envision for the future is just that — a step. He is still highly reliant on his midrange jumper, which has accounted for 47 percent of his shots this season (he makes 43 percent of them, according to cleaningtheglass.com). Although he is finishing better at the rim, where buckets are a surer thing, he still takes only 32 percent of his shots there and 21 percent from three.

AD

Washington would like to see those numbers skew more toward the three-point column, but overall, Brooks is happy with Hachimura’s newfound confidence and ability to anticipate plays developing. Westbrook sees the development, too.

“It just takes a little time when you get a chance to be around him and understand what he likes, what he don’t like, where he’s comfortable, where he’s not,” Westbrook said. “For me, that helps me out a lot, not just on the court but talking to him off the floor, explaining the game, understanding things he may or may not know. He’s young. Honestly, I’ve been in the league some time to be able to know a little more about the game and the season’s ups and downs.”

Hachimura does have one thing to school Westbrook on, at least. The veteran still needs to learn the proper Japanese term for his mentee.",2021-04-02 00:00:00
I never liked animals. Then I got a pandemic pet bunny.,"When my husband and I got married almost 17 years ago, we agreed: No pets. Kids, we decided, would be enough to take care of. Now, with three of them ages 13, 11 and 9, I can attest that they are a zoo unto themselves.

But then, last May, a friend asked our family to pet-sit her new fluffy black Havana rabbit. Could we watch the little guy for a month or two while she embarked on an extensive home remodel? At my kids’ insistence, I grudgingly agreed. I figured it would give them a spot of joy while virtual school had us all sticking close to home. But I made sure we took on the yet-unnamed animal on one condition: He’d return to his rightful home as soon as possible.

Nibbles, a bunny, has brought joy and comfort to the Garone family during the coronavirus pandemic. (Sarah Garone)

Bunny, as we creatively called him, didn’t take long to get comfortable at our house. He seemed to stake his claim on our fireplace as his preferred hangout, which I found amusing. Of all the places to choose, why the one where he could get roasted on a spit?

In the mornings, when we’d let him out of his cage, he’d go charging through the house with such boundless enthusiasm that I soon began to imagine him with his own theme music (and perhaps, a cape). When excited to see us, whether returning from the grocery store, a walk around the block or for no reason at all, he’d run joyful, hippety-hopping circles around our legs. And I couldn’t help but appreciate that his energy wasn’t accompanied by the disruptive barking or meowing that drives me batty in dogs and cats. He made no noise at all — a welcome feature in an animal, by my standards.

Even though he dropped occasional pea-size pellets on the carpet and chewed the lower perimeter of a rather expensive Mexican pine bookcase in our dining room, I found that I couldn’t stay mad at him. The more I petted his soft, silky fur and snuggled him during movie nights on the couch, the more I realized, to my own amazement, that I actually really liked this animal.

So when Bunny’s owner let us know that she wouldn’t be able to take him back as planned, a Serious Family Discussion found me in favor of keeping him. After all, his care and upkeep were so simple, he didn’t take up much space, and it didn’t hurt that he ate the scraps of going-bad spinach I otherwise would have guiltily tossed into the trash. In a family vote of 3 to 2, Bunny became an official member of our household. Not long after, in a symbolic gesture of his permanence, we named him: Nibbles.

My children eventually returned to school in person, leaving me working from home with Nibbles as my daytime companion. In the ensuing months, I’ve been surprised to discover how much his presence cuts the loneliness of tapping away by myself at my laptop. (My husband works from home, too, but I can’t exactly snuggle him while he’s on sales calls.) With Nibbles’s warmth and softness sidled up to me, I feel a little less alone in a world where, for the moment, social interaction is on a relative hiatus.

It’s not lost on me, either, that as my kids approach their teen years and I’ve flirted with the thought of another baby, Nibbles fills that void with far less commitment — and zero diapers. I know deep down that I don’t really want to go back to square one in parenting. But doting on this cuddly little animal fills a corner of my mothering heart: the part that wants to nurture, caretake and give love to a small creature.

In fact, it’s the tenderness that I feel for my pandemic pet bunny that has convinced me of the merits of having an animal. I see now that a connection with any fellow creature, especially during these difficult days of anger, frustration and sadness, is a beautiful thing. I love my husband and children unconditionally, of course — but not uncomplicatedly. No matter how deep my connections with them may be, I can’t deny that our status as flawed humans sometimes makes our relationships difficult. My love for Nibbles, on the other hand, is one thing in my life that feels untouchably pure. These days, that’s a rare find.

AD

AD

Although I’m still solidly anti-reptile and not ready to venture into dog territory, 10 months of rabbit care has gradually opened my eyes to the validity of the attachment people have to their animals. In short, I get it now. I get how any source of tenderness and love, whether from humans or animals, enriches our lives. At a friend’s house recently, when her terrier demanded my attention, I found myself petting his shaggy coat rather than pushing him away. Who am I to turn away a simple creature’s affection?

Meanwhile, as my heart has thawed toward other people’s animals, it has practically burst with delight for my own. I’ve turned into that lady who will regale you with stories of the latest adorable thing her pet did, who misses her fur baby while on vacation, who wonders why, if there are dog-friendly parks and restaurant patios, why not rabbit-friendly ones?

In the end, maybe my trouble with animals was simply that I hadn’t met the right one.

"For parents, ‘spring fever’ feels different this year","This week it was the latter: high winds (and the neighbor’s wind chimes) waking me in the wee hours. Sure enough, in the morning while sending the kids off to school and walking the dog, I found dozens of magnolias on the sidewalk and in the grass, many shut tight and still half in their furry gray pods.

AD

AD

On one hand, I roll my eyes at those trees. Every year! They never learn. On the other hand, maybe I can take a note from them. Even if frost weren’t an issue, there is always a chance of thunderstorms, a chance of high winds. There is no completely safe, completely peaceful season.

So here we are.

Spring is arriving literally and metaphorically. Coronavirus vaccines are becoming more widely available. Some children, like my own, are returning to school. With warmer weather comes a chance for us to see our friends and family again, even if outdoors and distanced. Have my kids been looking forward to being back in school with their friends and teachers? Playing outside with friends after school and on the weekends, even masked, even distanced? Yes, they have. Have I missed my backyard socially distanced, BYOB happy hours? Yes, I have.

“Spring fever” feels different this year, a year since the world changed — shrank — for us all. I think the sense of renewal and hope we’re experiencing this year is magnified by how shut-in and anxious we’ve all been through the winter. I’m feeling an odd mix of near-giddiness and trepidation about the months to come, much like those magnolias, which could bloom at any moment, be blown down or freeze.

AD

AD

Winter was especially challenging for me and my two kids. In December my ex-husband moved out of state. Timed perfectly with that shift — because when it rains, it pours — our school district instituted a new hybrid plan beginning after the winter break.

For the past few months, my son attended elementary school each day for three hours in the afternoon, after lunch. Was my sixth-grader on the same schedule as my second-grader? Of course not. My daughter attended middle school all day, during regular school hours, but only two or three days a week.

If this sounds like a nightmare for working parents — and in particular for single working parents — it was. I had about five guaranteed hours to myself most weeks, when both children were at school in person. There were some lunches to pack, and other lunches to cook. There were drives to two different schools a few times a day. My work requires uninterrupted time and space, and a couple of hours here and there was simply not cutting it. The past year has been a year of parents — and children — being asked to do what feels impossible, and having to do it anyway.

AD

AD

I sort of wish I had a screenshot of my therapist’s face on Zoom when she asked about self-care, and I told her I was trying to find a half-hour in my schedule to cry. I know I am not the only working single parent who hasn’t had time to feel.

On Twitter, some fellow writer-moms and I were commiserating about how many of us have cried in the bathroom. It’s one of the only places where we can be alone — and frankly, sometimes we can’t even get privacy there. There could be a very thick coffee table book from the pandemic experience called “Mothers Crying in Bathrooms.”

But maybe, just maybe, that’s all about to change.

Here in central Ohio, for example, our school district just shifted to “all-in” learning, so all of the students attend every day. I don’t want my children being unmasked inside the school building with so many people, so I’m bringing them home for lunch when they are unable to eat outside — on two different lunch hours, naturally. Even so, all-in will mean about five hours a day for me instead of five hours a week. I won’t waste a minute of it.

On my kids’ first day of all-in school, I dropped them off, walked the dog and then drove across town to a hospital complex for my first of two coronavirus vaccinations. Thank you, Pfizer.

Later, after dinner, we celebrated their first full day with our first “malt walk” of 2021. It’s a family tradition: we walk to Graeter’s for ice cream, then walk around our neighborhood talking, eating and laughing. It was a taste of normalcy. Delicious normalcy.

We’re also looking forward to getting back to other regular springtime activities. I just renewed our Franklin Park Conservatory membership, and I’m excited to take the kids to see the butterflies again this year — masked, by appointment. We skipped the exhibit last year because of lockdown, but it’s an annual tradition. I have pictures of both kids there in strollers. One year a beautiful blue morpho butterfly landed on my sweater, and I carried it with me through the exhibit for several long minutes.

Soon, too, we’ll resume weekly Sunday dinners at my parents’ house, the house I was raised in, with my parents, sisters, brothers-in-law, niece and nephews. One day, we’ll be able to gather around the kitchen table again, but for now the warm weather means we can sit out back, socially distanced, and eat on the deck and on picnic blankets in the yard.

All winter we tried to keep this tradition alive, shivering in their backyard for quick visits, sometimes bringing my mom’s homemade meatballs and sauce home in Tupperware to heat up for dinner. Our family is close, and we will always make do. But spring arriving, and the promise of summer on its heels, makes spending time together so much easier.

We can’t stay tucked away forever, folded tightly like those magnolia buds before they open. This new season brings with it excitement, growth, plenty of beauty, and yes, some anxiety, too — and that mix is not unique to spring. That’s the stuff of life.

"Food delivery apps are exempt from posting nutrition information. This loophole has added to our pandemic pounds, advocates say.","Any restaurant with more than 20 locations is required as part of the Affordable Care Act to display dishes’ calories on print and digital menus, as well as to make other nutrition information available. These delivery apps weren’t prevalent when the menu-labeling requirement was established.

Mary Story, a nutrition professor at Duke University’s Global Health Institute, says recent research has shown this amends people’s ordering behaviors and frequently causes restaurant brands to reformulate foods in a healthier way.

AD

AD

Creating supermenus displaying all of the restaurants and foods available, these third-party platforms use artificial intelligence and sophisticated algorithms to track consumers’ lifetime purchases and make strategic “upsell” suggestions, additions that often increase calories consumed, according to Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. Sites and apps that don’t offer calorie counts and nutrition information leave consumers more vulnerable to persuasion, he says.

Consumer advocacy groups such as the American Heart Association, Consumer Reports and the Center for Science in the Public Interest asked the FDA this week to close that loophole, a loophole that has taken on greater significance during the pandemic as consumers’ ordering habits have changed.

“Until the FDA issues interpretive guidance confirming that menus listed on third-party platforms are required to list nutrition information, many covered establishments will not do so, causing a gap in access to information. This gap has become increasingly important as more Americans order meals through third-party platforms during the covid-19 pandemic,” reads the group’s letter, sent Thursday to Susan Mayne, director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.

About 80 percent of non-pizza digital orders early in the pandemic were done through ordering platforms such as DoorDash, Seamless, Grubhub and Uber Eats, according to market research firm NPD Group, which tracks restaurant spending.

Spicy fried chicken sandwiches, hefty beef burritos and other calorically dense food have seen tremendous growth in popularity during the pandemic. An Axios-Ipsos survey in February asked about weight gain, finding 32 percent of Americans saying they recently added weight. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says obesity worsens covid-19 outcomes and estimates that 30 percent of hospitalizations were attributed to obesity.

Brian Ronholm, the director of food policy at Consumer Reports, says the restaurant industry has always tried to find ways to hide this information and that, before the menu-labeling requirements went into effect in May 2018, many restaurants wanted to keep the information online somewhere but not put it on menus.

“The pushback from FDA is that there may be more important enforcement issues right now, but information like this is going to be more important than ever,” he said.

In a statement, the FDA says it recognizes that the dining landscape has changed considerably since the menu-labeling requirements were passed into law, especially with the rise of third-party websites and delivery apps to provide convenient options for ordering to dine at home.

AD

AD

“Third-party ordering websites were not covered in the ACA language, so they are not required to comply. They could comply voluntarily if they choose to,” an FDA spokeswoman said.

McDonald’s has chosen to post calorie and nutrition information across its own restaurants and digital platforms as well as third-party delivery platforms. Ronholm pointed to this as evidence that other restaurants could easily do this but elect not to.

Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats spokeswomen said that their companies’ platforms allow restaurants to post calorie counts and nutrition information in the description fields on menu items. Most do not.

Asked about the consumer groups’ request that the FDA close this loophole, Campbell Matthews, a DoorDash spokeswoman, said: “We welcome the opportunity to engage with policymakers and stakeholders on this and other important issues impacting our industry.”

Eva Greenthal, senior science policy associate at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says that the responsibility is on both the restaurants and the third-party platforms, and that if dishes aren’t labeled as per the law, they are “misbranded.”

AD

AD

“The law is explicit in saying that menus posted on the Internet are included, it’s unambiguous,” she said. “We have this great public health legislation in place that should help consumers make healthy choices — the law was written with that intention. But now that most people are online-ordering, the law will not have its intended effect.”

According to an FDA regulatory impact analysis, healthier consumer behaviors arising from the ACA menu-labeling policy change were expected to yield a net savings of $8 billion in health-care costs over 20 years.

Chester says these third-party ordering apps combine powerful profiling of consumers with effective predictions in how to sell them more.

AD

“They are constantly gathering data and analyzing what you and your friends do, in order to increase basket size, increase sales and make you order more than you otherwise would,” he said. “What the FDA really should do is open up an investigation with the Federal Trade Commission, but at the very least there should be a real-time notice that what you’re about to order totals 1,800 calories, that this bucket of chicken and fries is the equivalent to your daily calorie count.”

AD

Chester points to DoorDash’s own language about optimizing spending with machine learning: “The first building block our marketing optimization system needs is an understanding of how every new user came to DoorDash. Which ads did they interact with on their journey to becoming a DoorDash customer? … Our channel partners provide us data for which DoorDash customers converted through their channel. … Switching to [a machine-learning]-based lifetime value model so that we can optimize our spend for users’ total lifetime value rather than for one-time conversions.”

Chester says these are “highly addictive tools” and that the platforms use information about customers to manipulate their purchases.",2021-04-01 00:00:00

A few minutes later, she admitted that she had sent the invitation to me accidentally.

The kicker was that someone backed out at the last minute, and then I got an actual invite and was told that if I wanted to attend, I'd better be wearing a theme costume like everyone else. I declined.

Am I wrong to feel insulted? I've never brought this up to her, but think it was rude.

I think it is way past the appropriate time to bring this up now.

— Slighted BFF

Slighted BFF: It is completely legitimate to feel insulted when someone insults you. Absolutely.

I suspect the reason you’ve ruminated on this for over a year is: either you somehow believe your feelings are not to be trusted, or, even if your feelings are trustworthy, you don’t have the right to “have” them.

AD

Despite the fact that she tells you that you two are “best friends forever,” she seems to have demoted you.

Regardless of your place in her friendship pecking order, if she wanted to spend time with you — best friend or not — she would find a way to do that.

Yes, it is probably too late to bring up an incident that happened over a year ago. Bringing this up wouldn’t change anything.

AD

All you need to do now is to believe in your instincts, trust your own feelings, and behave the way YOU want to behave.

This person has earned a demotion in your friendship pecking order. I’d suggest the category of: “Someone I used to be close to.”

Dear Amy: I had a friend for 49 years. We went to college together and have maintained a very sisterly relationship.

She dropped me like a hot potato. I've sent a few notes, but no response.

She didn't seem to understand that I was uncomfortable having them in our house both for our health and for theirs.

There has been no contact since then. This has made me very unhappy.

AD

I so want to know why. Is she so self-centered that their vacation was more important than others' health during this crazy time?

I'm brokenhearted. I wonder if other people have had similar experiences.

AD

Brokenhearted: Many people have had experiences similar to yours over the past year.

Assuming (hoping) that the pandemic that has changed the world will be receding along its own chaotic course within the next few months, many of us will be spending that time trying to repair relationships that have been bent or broken because of differences with how we have perceived our risks.

On the face of it, your friend’s behavior is selfish and indefensible.

If her behavior last year was completely uncharacteristic, then you can attempt to move forward by reaching out again to say, “I’ve been thinking so much about you over these last months. I hope you are healthy and were able to get your vaccine. Given all this pandemic has stolen from so many of us, I hope you won’t let it take our friendship, too.”

Miss Manners: Should daughter invite distant father to wedding?,"All this being said, my daughter wants to invite them to the wedding, which I thought was nice and the right thing to do. My concern is that there won't be any acknowledgment of him as her ""father"" — no walking down the aisle, no father-daughter dance, no boutonniere.

AD

AD

This is my daughter's decision, and I understand completely where she is coming from. But I am worried about inviting him and then making him feel bad, awkward or whatever the case may be.

It is likely no surprise to her father that they are not close. But if it is your daughter’s intention to have her stepfather perform those duties, there may indeed be awkwardness and hurt feelings.

A gracious way around it — and one that Miss Manners recommends in your case — is to have you, her mother, walk her down the aisle. You could dance with her, too — or forgo that particular tradition, at least as a viewer spectacle — and she might find time to dance with all of the parents and stepparents later in the reception.

AD

As Miss Manners has repeatedly emphasized, it is the actual people involved and not the casting of (particularly gendered) roles that is important. Whatever traditions the bride thinks she is upholding should be adapted as much as possible to avoid hurt feelings.

AD

Dear Miss Manners: When my children receive a gift, I am careful to ensure they participate in writing a thank-you note, even from a young age.

I was taught that it is proper to write a note in black or blue ink, never pencil. However, with my younger children, who are still learning how to write and spell, this is leading to a great deal of wasted stationery. When they make a mistake, as is normal to do at their age, we need to throw out the card and start over, sometimes three times.

AD

Would it be acceptable for a young child to write a card in pencil? Or should I write the card for them in pen?

Have the children write a rough draft that they can then copy onto the good stationery in ink. There still may be mistakes, but as long as cross-outs and bumpy white blotches are confined to a reasonable one or two per letter, the recipients — and Miss Manners — will most assuredly be forgiving.

Theaters in Washington are innovating on the Internet unil they're back on stage live,"Woolly Mammoth Theatre, Studio Theatre and Arena Stage are among the Washington theaters with new offerings on their websites. Still, how these works fare on practical levels — such as WiFi reliability and technical mastery of a visual medium — reveals the Internet as bumpy terrain for a field that breathes more naturally in shared public air.

Viewers must show forbearance for artists exercising new virtual muscles. And in each of these productions, one finds much to admire in the aspiration to push the boundaries of theatrical storytelling. But there are some glitches in Web performance that can dull the intended effect.

AD

AD

Take, for instance, the problems that handicapped the live stream Thursday of Woolly’s searingly intelligent “Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran.” Created by Javaad Alipoor and Kirsty Housley — and performed by Alipoor and Peyvand Sadeghian — the 70-minute play is a kaleidoscopic anthropological survey. It starts with a single tragic event, the fatal 2015 crash of a sports car in Tehran, and uses it for a breathtaking treatise on global excess, human overreach and the possibly terminal damage inflicted by (mostly White European) hegemonic cultures.

It’s hard to believe the production originated on the stage in the United Kingdom, because it seems so craftily assembled for digital. Its creators ask you to follow along, both on the live stream and through a private hashtag on Instagram. The narrators toggle between the platforms, relating in reverse chronology the personal details of the young, affluent Iranian couple who died in the crash — just as one might scroll through anyone’s Instagram account, ever more deeply through photos posted in the past.

The conceit is thrilling, and the argument for historical linkage that Alipoor and Housley construct is inspired. The difficulty on Thursday was that the dialogue was out of sync for much of the production — at least, it was on my connection — and as a result, the captioning didn’t match the narration. At times, in my efforts to try to figure out what was awry, I lost the thread of this elegant rhetorical tapestry. Some of the rich flavor of the intellectual stew became diluted.

The issue, on the other hand, with Studio Theatre’s “Cock” was the eye of the camera itself. David Muse, Studio’s artistic director, first staged Mike Bartlett’s acute drama of sexual ambivalence in 2014; he explains in a program note that he wanted to do it again “because I had a notion that cameras would invite some different ways in.” And indeed, the play becomes an even more intensely watchable battle of wills in which John, the central character portrayed by an impeccably anguished Randy Harrison, struggles to conform to the demands for commitment from his lovers — one male (Scott Parkinson), one female (Kathryn Tkel).

AD

AD

Parkinson, reprising his 2014 performance, and Tkel provide powerhouse turns here. Their characters, identified only as M and W, are as confidently anchored in their own sexual choices as John seems unsettled in his. (Alan Wade offers persuasive pique as the fourth character, M’s interfering father, F.) As you watch John’s torture escalate at being compelled to declare himself gay or straight, you question ever more deeply the world’s insistence at such binary pronouncements.

Bartlett, author of the Broadway monarchal satire “King Charles III,” does a princely job of diagraming the dispute; that John has the blurriest identity and the only recognizable name is just one of his canny touches. And Muse, setting the play in a circular sand pit, the barefooted actors bathed in an octagon of fluorescent light, bottles tension so effectively he could sell the extra in an online souvenir shop.

The cameras, though, sometimes feel too present. Muse overuses split screens and other devices, and the lens doesn’t always ideally frame the perspective: One body looms larger than the other, or the lighting doesn’t quite match up on the divided sides of the screen. This is a case of a director still getting his filmic feet wet.

In Arena Stage’s “The Freewheelin’ Insurgents,” another budding film director in the District, Psalmayene 24, gets a welcome chance to experiment with technique. His 23-minute film is a wistful expression, in hip-hop and spoken vignettes, of the opportunities a pandemic robs from theater artists. Recorded in black-and-white, the production gathers five Washington actors — Louis E. Davis, Shannon Dorsey, Gary L. Perkins III, Justin Weaks and the director himself — who portray a troupe waiting in a snow-covered park for inspiration to strike, and theaters to reopen.

The project is one of a trio of short original musicals Arena has commissioned under the umbrella title “Arena Riffs”; it has already unveiled “My Joy is Heavy!” by the folk-rock duo the Bengsons.

AD

AD

You get tastes in the embryonic “The Freewheelin’ Insurgents” of stories that cry out for development, most interestingly in the relationship between Dorsey’s Zora and Perkins’s Noble. Their romance is revealed in a brief “stylized movement duet,” danced to a jazz underscoring played by Nick Tha 1da.

“What are they doing?” asks Davis’s character, Church.

“I don’t know,” replies Weaks’s Dante.

“The Freewheelin’ Insurgents” has that kind of raw, improvisational home-movie feel. Like the shutdown itself, the movie comes across as unfinished business. As Psalmayene 24 adds more context, his film will be worth another look.

"Beyond Vivaldi, a classical playlist to bring on the spring","It’s a rather harmless irony that we tend to greet this annual influx of newness with the same ol’ bouquet of spring themes. Instinctually, we turn to the standard seasonal reveries of Haydn, Vivialdi and Glazunov; those sturdy vernal symphonies of Beethoven (his “Pastoral”) and Schumann (his “Spring”); and familiar petal-plucking daydreams a la Mendelssohn’s “Spring Song.”

AD

Dig a bit below this topsoil and you’ll find loads of odes to spring. There’s Copland’s poetic paean “Appalachian Spring”; the limpid trickle of Grieg’s “Til Varen” (“To Spring”); the undersung Lili Boulanger’s sensuous “D’un matin de printemps” (“Of a Spring Morning”); and Glazunov’s lesser-known stand-alone “Spring” (which he called a “symphonic picture”).

AD

Any of these could be the seeds of a substantial spring playlist. And below, find a few more suggestions that are helping me hear the season anew.

Astor Piazzolla, 'Primavera Porteña'

We begin here because if you’ve never heard the Argentine composer and bandoneon master Astor Piazzolla’s suite of seasonal tangos, “Estaciones Porteñas” (i.e. “The Four Seasons of Buenos Aires”) you should do that right now. My favorite version is a hard-to-find but highly YouTube-able 1970 recording from the Teatro Regina in Buenos Aires, where Piazzolla performed the suite in full (and on fire) with his Quinteto Astor Piazzolla. (It’s outrageously lovely.) But recently, I’ve grown fond of a version just released by classical guitarist Stephanie Jones, who strips the tango down to an exquisitely lucid solo. It appears with the other “Estaciones” and works by other South American composers on her new album, “Open Sky.”

Germaine Tailleferre, 'Ballade'

There’s nothing explicitly spring about “Ballade,” a short orchestral work completed in 1922 by the Parisian composer Germain Tailleferre — the only female member of “Les Six,” critic Henri Collet’s moniker for a somewhat arbitrarily grouped circle of composers working in Montparnasse in the ’20s. But with its twists and bends, its sudden bursts of color, its impressionistic stretches and winks of dissonance (like the unknowably pretty chord that cuts like a sunrise through the final movement and launches its yawning resolution), “Ballade” feels like wandering through an enchanted garden on the brink of bursting — or a particularly vivid dream of one. It’s hard to come by a recording, but Florian Uhlig’s 2017 performance with the Deutsche Radio Philharmonie Saarbrücken Kaiserslautern feels essential in his celebration of every detail.

Claude Debussy, 'Printemps'

Since we’re already in Paris in the spring, let’s check in with Claude. He composed his “Printemps” (“Springtime”) for orchestra and wordless choir in 1887, with the idea of creating “not a descriptive ‘Printemps,’ but a human one.” “I should like to express the slow and labored birth of beings and things in nature,” he wrote, “their gradual blossoming, and finally the joy of being born into some new life.” As it turns out, “Printemps” would have to be reborn, as the manuscript was devoured by a fire at a Paris bindery. In 1914, Debussy supervised Henri Büsser in creating two new versions of the work — one for orchestra and another for four-handed piano, to which I’ve grown quite attached. In the four hands of Swiss piano duo Adrienne Soos and Ivo Haag, Debussy’s colors are lifted, and the piece tilts around in the light like a prism.

Florence Price, 'Fantasie Nègre No. 3'

Elsewhere in delicate restorations is a newly restored piece of music history. In 2019, the pianist, musicologist and Florence Price scholar Samantha Ege (currently Lord Crewe junior research fellow in music at Lincoln College, University of Oxford) visited the Florence Price archives at the University of Arkansas, determined to locate the composer’s four “Fantasie Nègre” solo pieces for piano, never published in Price’s lifetime. “The histories of Black women composers from the past are often such a challenge to recuperate,” Ege tells me in an email, “because of the lack of publishing opportunities in their time, the scant documentation of their achievements, and their absence in institutional archives.” The resultant stunner of a collection, “The Piano Music of Florence Price,” collects (for the first time) all four Fantasies, as well as a trio of untitled sketches and another cluster of “Snapshots” — with all but the first of the Fantasies drawn from archives discovered in 2009 at Price’s summer home in St. Anne, Ill. These Fantasies capture Price at her most expressive, and this performance finds Ege at her most intuitive, especially when it comes to the Third, which Price reassembled from its two extant pages and loose pages that beckoned to her from a different key. “The twists and turns that I had tried to make sense of in my head when I was in the archives came together once I sat at the piano,” she says. Similarly, Price’s music — its pride, elegance, folk echoes and blue hues — fills some essential gaps in the story of American music.

Ottorino Respighi, '6 Pieces for Piano' P. 44: No. 3. Notturno. Lento

The harp is having a moment right now, and I am very much here for it. Young harpists like Parker Ramsay, Brandee Younger and Madison Calley are finding new expressive and interpretive possibilities for the instrument — as well as thousands of followers. Lately, I’ve been caught in a loop listening to Magdalena Hoffmann, principal harpist of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and her beguiling transcription of one of Respighi’s short piano pieces (“Notturno”) — likely to be a centerpiece on her night-centered Deutsche Grammophon debut, due out next January. As with Ramsay’s recent interpretation of the “Goldberg Variations,” Hoffman’s harp lends the piece an entirely different aura — melodic pluck hovering in vaporous harmony.



Jonathan Harvey, 'Bird Concerto with Pianosong'",2021-03-31 00:00:00
Who Is Maud Dixon? by Alexandra Andrews book review,"“Who is Maud Dixon?” is light on character development and plausibility, but rife with the most important ingredient in this strain of suspense fiction: inventiveness. The plot here makes whiplash turns, loop de loops and sudden reversals. It opens in Morocco, swerves to New York and ends up in the cool amoral vacuity familiar to fans of Patricia Highsmith’s Ripley novels. What’s not to enjoy?

AD

AD

The apparent innocent thrust into peril at the beginning of the novel is named Florence Darrow, an aspiring writer working as a publishing assistant at the “niche” firm, Forrester Books. (“When Florence interviewed there, a senior editor had told her, ‘We don’t do commercial fiction,’ as if it were a euphemism for child pornography.”) Lonely Florence, who grew up in Nowheresville, Fla., and is now estranged from her single mother, was the kind of high school kid who hugged Joan Didion’s “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” to her chest like body armor. But she soon wises up to the fact that her bookishness isn’t going to take her far: The New York publishing world favors glossy assistants who graduated from elite schools.

Her prospects nosedive when some spectacularly self-destructive behavior following a hookup at firm’s holiday party costs Florence her job. It’s at that moment, when she’s resigned to giving up on her dreams, that fate intervenes in the form of a phone call from a prominent literary agent searching for an assistant for one of her writers. Florence interviews and then lands what must surely be one of the most coveted gigs for any young person yearning to break into the inner circles of the literati: personal assistant to Maud Dixon.

Who is Maud Dixon? Well, think of her as a mass cult version of Elena Ferrante (before she was exposed). All that anyone (apart from her agent) knows is that Maud Dixon is the pseudonym of the mega best-selling author of “Mississippi Foxtrot,” the psychological suspense novel that everyone is reading. When Florence moves into Maud’s isolated house in rural New York State to begin her new job, she becomes the second person in the entire world to know the true identity of the reclusive, hard-drinking, and prickly author. Maud’s temperament isn’t improved by the fact that she’s wrestling with writer’s block, otherwise known as the curse of the stalled second novel. Impulsively, Maud decides that a trip to Morocco will jolt her creative juices. Off to Marrakesh, Maud flies in high style, whisking Florence along with her (in coach class).

Here’s Florence, a few days before her first international flight, waiting for her expedited passport and meditating on the promise of travel:

AD

AD

“Florence had a sense that she . . . would return a different person, that travel would change her. Change is never a smooth curve; it comes in leaps and jolts, plateaus and remissions. And in the periods after an old identity fades away but before a new one is fully installed, there is a certain sense of impunity. As if nothing quite matters. You are not quite yourself. You’re not quite anyone.”

Poor naive Florence. (Or is she?)

Once the two women land in Morocco, the sinister game of shedding identities begins and Maud and Florence begin tossing their passports back and forth like hot potatoes . . . or hand grenades. “Who Is Maud Dixon?” turns out to be much more than a question about authorship; indeed, it’s a question fraught with life and death consequences. Andrews’s novel is sharp, unpredictable and enormously entertaining. To say anything more would ruin the fun of reading — and being lightly appalled — by it.

"Q&A with Leslie Jordan: Why he made a country album, how Capote saved his life and spending time in the ‘pokey’ with Robert Downey Jr.","(This interview has been edited for clarity and length.)

Q: So you have an album coming out this week called ""Company's Comin',"" featuring duets of country songs.

A: Yes, it’s really a gospel album. Old Southern hymns that I grew up with. When I was putting together the list of people I wanted to be on it — Katie Pruitt, Brandi Carlisle, Dolly Parton, T.J. Osborne, my friend Danny Myrick, Tanya Tucker, Eddie Vedder, Travis Howard, Ashley McBryde, Charlie Worsham — not one person said no.

AD

AD

Q: You grew up in Tennessee at a time when country music was a very specific thing. Did you love it as a boy?

A: You know, I did, but I was a closeted country music fan because that was the time of Grand Funk Railroad and people my age listening to . . .

Q: . . . people like the Electric Prunes.

A: Oh, I don’t remember the names of all those groups. But in the end, it was hippie music. We had long hair. I looked like a little rock-and-roll troll doll. I was about this tall with all this hair and I was listening to hippie music. But I did love country music and I loved the old stuff with Loretta Lynn and Merle Haggard. I would listen to it on the sly.

Q: You have T.J. Osborne on your record, who is the only openly gay major country artist on a major label today. And you think about the late Charley Pride, what he went through as a Black country singer. There really were no models for you in country music, but also in Southern life, were there?

AD

AD

A: No. I remember Truman Capote, he went on Johnny Carson and I was just . . . I mean, he came out with, grown men didn’t act like that with that scarf. And the little kind of what gnarliest people say, he had a lisp. It was a very strange little speech impediment that he had. But anyway, he would come out on Johnny Carson and I went to the bathroom and threw up. The very next day I went to the Chattanooga Public Library and I checked out every book that Truman Capote had written. And I began to read them. And he was very good at veiled inferences, you know. And at 14, that kind of saved me. It really did. And then I got a chance to play him. It was Broadway bound.

Q: What makes the great Leslie Jordan in the middle of a pandemic decide to make a country album?

A: Well, I felt that people needed a little comfort. And see, most of these songs were all hymns. And just like Elvis and Loretta, we came up in the church, all of us did. And on Sunday morning, we sang these hymns. My journey in and out of the church was that I felt early on that I couldn’t embrace something that didn’t really embrace me, and I sort of walked away. But then you realize when you get older, I have no ax to grind, especially with these songs.

AD

AD

Q: I never met Tanya Tucker, but I would like to rent a van and just drive down the West Coast with her. Tell me about her. What should I know?

A: Here’s what you should know. She is without a doubt the most fun person that I think I’ve ever met. She’s just a handful.

Q: When you say a handful, what exactly do you mean?

A: Well, the point is just there’s a lot of storytelling. She was 14 years old and running around with all those old haggard cowboys, like Merle and Willie Nelson and all of them. And she was 14 years old, singing and running around. She has stories about everybody. She’s the best drinking partner and I’m 22 years sober, but we won’t go down that road.

AD

Q: You have a book coming out and talk about your life, and you talked about this with Anderson Cooper quite a bit. You drank for a while. And something precipitated your quitting 22 years ago, right?

AD

A: Yes. Well, it was a trip to the pokey. I was the man sitting in the slammer with Robert Downey Jr.

Q: I'm sorry, this is a serious thing. But when someone says, the pokey, and you mentioned Robert Downey Jr. Explain please, to the public.

A: I got arrested for my third DUI in California, which takes it very seriously. You get one, you know, you can have too much wine on an empty stomach, whatever. That’s a slap on the wrist. You get two and usually they take away your license and you pay $1,000. You get three and all my friends said that you’re going to jail. I said, “I can’t go to jail. I’m on [the television show] ‘Pacific Blue.’ ”

AD

Q: That is one of the top three ""Family Feud"" excuses given by people arrested. ""Hey, I'm in a show with Mario Lopez.""

A: It does not work. And so I was sitting in the slammer. And 12 days into this unfortunate incarceration, I went to the guy that lets everybody in and out with the turnkey, and I said, “I’m having sort of a panic attack and if you could let me out, I will walk around the block and I’ll come back.” He said, “You’re not going nowhere.” Then he came over later and said, “Listen, we’ve taken pity on you and you’ve done 12 days of your 120-day sentence. We have Robert Downey Jr. downstairs and we don’t have anywhere to put him. So he’s going to take your place, but you have to share a holding time.”

AD

Q: Did you end up talking about it later with Downey?

AD

A: He didn’t remember because four years later I was on “Ally McBeal” and Robert walked in and said, “Do I know you?” And I said, “Zip it.” He said, “What? Come outside.” Then I said, “We were in Pod A, cell 13, top bunk.” And he said, “You know what? You wrote me that letter.”

Q: What letter?",2021-03-31 00:00:00
How ‘Shiva Baby’ captures the anxieties of being a young woman,"“It’s funny, there’s just the same amount of bragging and nosy questions,” she says of the shivas she has attended. “I initially thought of it as a bar joke — a girl runs into her sugar daddy at a shiva, and what happens after that? But as I was making it, I realized I was putting a lot of my insecurities into it, especially the way I felt when I was approaching graduation. All the pressure I felt.”

Those feelings were fresh for Seligman, 25, who directed her debut feature just a couple of years after graduating from college. Released Friday on-demand, “Shiva Baby” is a pressure cooker of a movie from the moment aspiring artist Danielle (Rachel Sennott) and her parents (Fred Melamed and Polly Draper) arrive at the shiva, where she is accosted with questions about her future: She plans to attend law school in the fall, right? Oh, wait, no, that’s Maya (Molly Gordon, playing Danielle’s ex).

AD

AD

From retro camera zooms to frames slightly curved in a “funhouse way,” the film’s stylistic choices capture Danielle’s claustrophobia — further projected to the audience through a horror-esque musical score by composer Ariel Marx. Seligman knew she wanted a sparse sound that relied on the palette of traditional Klezmer music “without it being ‘Fiddler on the Roof.’ ” To Marx, that meant setting brass and woodwinds aside to focus on strings.

“She wanted the score to really, really punctuate the anxiety, but nothing else,” Marx says. “That’s a fun task as a composer because what we ended up with was all about torturing the instrument.”

The frenzied score suggests as much, though Marx insists her violin and cello survived unscathed. At times joined by percussionist Sam Mazur, whose drumming contributes a low rumble, Marx built the sound from scratch. The original “Shiva Baby” short, Seligman’s college thesis that premiered at South by Southwest, lacked music, and she hadn’t added a temporary score to the feature before bringing Marx onboard. Even the anxiety-ridden references Seligman provided — Trey Edward Shults’s “Krisha” and the Safdies’ “Uncut Gems” among them — focused on the narrative more than sound.

In hindsight, Marx draws parallels between the textural quality of her score and that of the thrillers “Under the Skin,” “Hereditary” and “Midsommar.” Its few moments of quirkiness recall the work of composer Jon Brion, specifically for “Punch-Drunk Love.” But while working, Marx continually returned to Danielle’s frame of mind. What would establish the character’s audacious spirit as she arrives at the shiva just hours after leaving her sugar daddy’s apartment with a sparkly new bracelet? What would broadcast her panic upon seeing him (Danny Deferrari) enter the house, later joined by the wife (Dianna Agron) and child she didn’t know he had?

AD

AD

“Once we were shooting the scene where [Danielle] is looking over at Kim and Max’s baby for the first time, getting a good look at them and the baby is crying, I realized … the dialogue was background noise and the scene was about her really understanding what this baby meant in Max’s life,” Seligman says. She thought, “Music would be awesome to heighten this moment.”

Marx chose to layer trembling strings over the baby’s wails, adding rough plucks — the instrumental torture mentioned earlier, as she pulled the strings so they’d snap back against the fingerboard — to punctuate Danielle’s tense movements. There’s a snap as she lifts her chin to get a clearer look at Max and Kim, and another as Maya’s mother breaks that concentration to call her over.

“These are generally not sounds that you play and use for a beautifully soloistic violin passage,” Marx says, laughing. As Danielle departs her comfort zone, so, too, did Marx’s technique. She experimented with circular bowing for musical cues gluing the others together, a method utilizing the “warm, less defined color” from bowing over the fingerboard as well as the “grating, distorted sound” from near the bridge. It resulted in a hypnotic, off-kilter lull, Marx says, almost like the electricity flowing through Danielle’s veins.

AD

AD

This sound envelopes Danielle toward the end of the film, disheveled and emotionally overwhelmed as she approaches Kim and Max. The camera shakes as it narrows in on her face, the score nearly overpowering her uncomfortable chitchat with Kim about how “female entrepreneurs do it all.”

The compounded pressures Seligman felt at this point in her own life gave her a panic attack, she says. The “old traditional standard” of finding a stable job with a stable income contrasted with her desire to also be “an independent, sexually empowered young woman who doesn’t care what anyone thinks of her, who breaks the mold and doesn’t have a traditional career.”

She adds of the film, “I think I just wanted a window into the horror of being a young woman.”",2021-04-02 00:00:00
Where to see art gallery shows in the Washington region,"David-Jeremiah began with the pieces that include the abbreviations, the second of which expresses the same sentiment as the first, but rendered in Dallas slang. The letters look to be etched roughly into the painted surfaces of the plywood sheets, which are cut to mimic the hoods of Lamborghini sports cars (a boyhood fixation). Actually, the letters are raised, as are other gestures that suggest dents and scratches. The artist paints without brushes, using scraping tools to manipulate enamel paint similar to the pigment used on actual car bodies.

After some visitors to his studio reacted defensively to his new works, David-Jeremiah responded with a second series linked by color, but painted in varied, complex and sometimes more textured arrangements. He calls the lettered ones “Externalized” (anger in your face) and the others “Internalized” (anger in his gut).

In most cases, an “Externalized” is positioned atop its counterpart, suggesting preeminence. Gallery visitors, however, might prefer the “Internalizeds.” The former are raw and ardent. The latter are inventive, unexpected and open-ended. They manifest a source of artistic power other than wrath.

Saunders and Hutchison

To convey the myriad dimensions of the human form, Noah James Saunders and Scott Hutchison have each devised innovative techniques. Saunders uses black steel wire to construct hanging 3-D drawings that are defined as much by absence as presence. Hutchison overlaps multiple views, usually of the same person, a cubist strategy tempered by a realist style and neoclassical oil-painting technique.

AD

AD

“It’s like basket weaving,” Saunders recently told a visitor to “Sculpting Shadow,” one of the first shows at Amy Kaslow Gallery, a new venue in Spring Valley. The weaving is free-form and intuitive, though. Some of the Georgia artist’s statues are contained within circles, rectangles or cross-hatched grids, but the most vivid ones have no boundaries. All begin with an eye: Saunders builds outward from a single orb, using photos of complete strangers as models while knitting the wires freehand. He uses the shadows that the piece casts to guide his progress.

A gay man and an LGBT advocate, Saunders portrays only males, whether human or supernatural. (The arresting “Midnight Visitor” is a charismatic satyr with a goatee and antlers.) Most of the sculptures in this selection are busts, limited to shoulders, heads and extravagances of curly hair. But there is one three-quarters nude, “Selfie,” in which a man displays himself to a cellphone. It’s an explicitly corporeal moment, rendered in a few supple twists of wire.

Among the recent Hutchison paintings in “Flux,” at Fred Schnider Gallery of Art, are several that recall his earlier work. A fine example is the circular “Dreamtank,” in which a pastel-skinned female nude in a fetal position is split into four partly overlaid figures. The image suggests that both body and mind are in process, whether actually or symbolically. Such pictures are “meant to evoke the idea that our identity is in flux,” Hutchison told gallery-goers recently.

AD

AD

His latest paintings feature bolder, less naturalistic colors — notably clanging reds and greens — more muscular poses and the increased prominence of hands. (Two smaller pictures show only those.) Hands help create visual movement, noted the Arlington, Va., artist, who teaches at Georgetown University. Where the subject of “Dreamtank” seems impelled by larger forces, the clenched-fist figure in “Sentinel” declares his autonomy.

Hutchison’s experience as an animator informs his approach. He takes about 100 photos of a model, who’s allowed to choose her or his own poses, and then overlays them with photo-editing software until he finds the arrangement he wants to paint. The results are as stately as a Renaissance canvas, yet with an underlying sense of motion. In “Flux,” no aspect of humanity is fixed.

Adia Millett

Adia Millet’s show at Morton Fine Art is divided into fabric pieces and paintings, but the two categories overlap in theme and appearance. Almost all of the works include one or more circles that represent the heavenly body invoked in the exhibition’s title, “The Moon Is Always Full.” And two of the paintings arrange scraps of color as if they were pieces of material.

AD

AD

Millett often begins by disassembling cloth items, with the idea of symbolically reconstructing African American experience and identity. (She also tweaks White outlooks in the show’s least colorful and only circle-less entry, “OWF,” which stands for “off-white fragility.”) The California artist has a strong sense of form but little apparent interest in sheer abstraction. “Gold Roof” is little more than a triangle, a circle and several rectangles, but these elements are transmuted into a house under a full-moon sky by deft composition and the insertion of two 3-D model windows.

Just as streamlined are “Reflection,” a landscape-like picture that seems to be as much stitched as painted, and “Portal,” in which a blue round resembles the moon behind striated clouds, but also a cell or an egg. Any of those possibilities are apt, since Millett’s essential concerns include renewal and regeneration.",2021-03-31 00:00:00
How to get perfect sunny-side-up eggs every time,"And then there’s the issue of cooking a fried egg. To do it properly requires more oil (almost one cup) than I usually want to use. You can fry them with less oil, but then you’re either stuck at the stove, basting to get the egg white fully cooked (I’m too lazy for that) or okay with it being a little raw at the top (one of the few food things I’d rather not stomach).

AD

AD

There are other stovetop cooking methods that produce the soft and supple texture I often desire, but they have drawbacks of their own. One method, “blindfolding,” calls for dropping a few ice cubes in the pan and covering it to trap in the steam. This works well to cook the egg all of the way through while keeping it soft, but it also causes the yolk to film over, hiding its beautiful glow. Other websites recommend a similar technique sans ice that produces slightly closer results to what I want, but I’ve found that there’s a small window for perfection where the film doesn’t start to creep up over the yolk.

That’s where the oven comes into play. The gentle, indirect heat your oven provides cooks the white all the way through while keeping it tender and leaving the yolk as golden as the sun on a clear summer day.

I picked up this method working the egg station during the brunch shift, so I know from personal experience cooking dozens upon dozens of eggs this way that this technique is practically foolproof. Here’s how to cook picture-perfect sunny-side up eggs:

AD

AD

Heat the oven to a moderate temperature (in the range of 325 to 350 degrees).

In an oven-safe nonstick skillet over medium-low or medium heat, heat a small amount of fat — just enough help keep the eggs from sticking. (Heating the pan helps speed things up a bit, but this step isn’t vital.)

Crack your eggs into the skillet, one at a time, and cook until the whites begin to set, just a few seconds.

Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the whites are fully set but the yolks remain runny, 3 to 5 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper and you’re ready to go.

In my restaurant days we’d serve them atop kale salads and bowls of biscuits and gravy, or you could pile them on pasta or alongside crispy hash browns. Think of it as a less daunting way to add the benefits of a poached egg without the finickiness but with the aesthetics to create a feast for the eyes.",2021-04-02 00:00:00

This carrot cake with brown butter-cream cheese frosting will keep you coming back for more,"Instead, we repurposed the cake at the post-wedding brunch the following day and presented it as a birthday cake for Andrew’s grandfather. It wound up being a win-win.

It wasn’t until this assignment that I really went down the delicious carrot cake rabbit hole. Sure, I had made it from time to time, but it was always in a hurry to deliver a cake for a special occasion: a birthday, a Father’s Day celebration or random joyful moments we wanted to commemorate. I didn’t have a go-to recipe, and while the cakes I was making were fine, they weren’t extraordinary enough to be bookmarked. I moved from recipe to recipe, hoping to strike gold with one but not succeeding.

AD

AD

I was looking for more in my cake: It needed to be sufficiently (but not overly) carroty and moist, with a delicate crumb and varied textures. I opted for plump golden raisins, with their sweet honey notes, and toasted pecans, very finely chopped. To bump up the rich, warming flavors, I chose a symphony of spices: cinnamon, cardamom, allspice, nutmeg and ginger, both fresh and powdered. For a bit of tang, I added buttermilk.

The resulting cake layers are everything I wanted them to be and more. Friends and colleagues who tried it said the texture was perfect and the flavors balanced.

With the cake layers done, I moved on to the frosting. Inspired by a few recipes, including those from Jocelyn Delk Adams and Claire Saffitz, brown butter-cream cheese frosting sounded like an excellent idea. Melt and brown the butter — no need to wait for it to soften — then stir it over an ice bath until it is the texture of solid room-temperature butter, a process that takes about 25 minutes. Then, proceed to make the frosting as usual.

To get the most consistent results, I recommend sticking with Philadelphia cream cheese (the full-fat kind). When a grocery order went awry and only one package of Philly cream cheese was delivered, I made the frosting using my 8 ounces of Philly and an 8-ounce pack of a generic cream cheese from a national grocery store chain. (I was making the cake for the photo shoot — a detail that becomes relevant in a moment.) I sent off the cake layers and frosting to our saint of a food stylist with nary a thought, but the following day during the photo shoot, we discovered the frosting was too soft and slid off the cake. After retracing my steps, with the help of my colleagues Becky Krystal and G. Daniela Galarza, we deduced that the culprit was the generic brand cream cheese. Daniela explained that the stabilizers in cream cheese vary from brand to brand, and the one nationally available name that will get you consistent results is Philadelphia.

AD

AD

While I’m not big on hot takes, here’s one: Cream cheese frosting is the best part of carrot cake. In fact, it happens to be our family’s favorite frosting, and I make it so often, I forget its softer, more spreadable texture compared with its buttercream cousin. Keep that in mind when making it: If the frosting seems softer than usual, that’s normal. Too soft? Chill it for 20 minutes or so.

And depending on how generous a layer you want, you’ll likely have leftover frosting. I prefer a conservative approach, wanting the cake layers and frosting to complement one another. I freeze the excess frosting for next time I’m making a cake and reduce the next batch of frosting by about a third so I don’t wind up with too much again.

In our house, we love this carrot cake so much, we decided it’s our go-to cake for birthdays, Mother’s Day — any celebration, big or small. My 6-year-old declared it “the best cake ever,” and to quote the Eurythmics, who am I to disagree?

AD

AD

Make Ahead: The cake may be prepared, tightly wrapped and refrigerated, up to 1 day in advance. The frosting can be prepared up to 5 days in advance.

Storage Notes: The assembled cake can be refrigerated, properly covered, for up to 5 days. The cake layers may be tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, then foil, and frozen for up to 3 months; defrost overnight in the refrigerator. Leftover frosting may be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

Ingredients

For the cake

1/2 cup (120 milliliters) well-shaken buttermilk

2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 cup (110 grams) pecan halves, plus more for decorating the cake (optional)

3/4 cup (180 milliliters) canola oil or another neutral oil, plus more for greasing pans

1 1/2 cups (190 grams) all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon baking soda, sifted

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon ground ginger

1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom

1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg

1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

3 large eggs, at room temperature

1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar

1/4 cup packed (55 grams) dark brown sugar

11 ounces (310 grams) carrots (4 to 5 medium), scrubbed and trimmed

3/4 cup (105 grams) raisins, preferably golden

For the frosting

1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces/170 grams) unsalted butter

12 ounces (340 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

3 1/2 cups (1 pound/454 grams) confectioners’ sugar, sifted if very lumpy

Step 1

Make the cake layers: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

In a liquid measuring cup, combine the buttermilk, fresh ginger and vanilla.

AD

Step 2

Spread the pecans out on a small, rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 10 minutes, shaking midway through, until the nuts are deep golden brown and fragrant. Remove from the oven (leave the oven on) and transfer the nuts to a plate to cool. Once the nuts are cool, transfer to a food processor and pulse until very finely chopped.

AD

Step 3

While the nuts are toasting, lightly brush the bottom and sides of two (8-by-2-inch) cake pans with oil. Line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper and brush the paper with oil.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ground ginger, cardamom, nutmeg and allspice until combined.

AD

Step 4

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the eggs with the granulated and brown sugars and beat on medium-low speed to break up the eggs. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the mixture forms thick ribbons as it falls off the whisk, about 5 minutes.

Step 5

While the eggs and sugar are being whipped, grate the carrots on the large holes of a box grater or with the shredding disc of the food processor.

When the egg-sugar mixture is ready, slowly add the oil in a thin stream and beat until the mixture is glossy, plush and emulsified.

AD

Step 6

Switch to the paddle attachment and add about a third of the flour mixture to the egg mixture. Mix on low speed just to combine. Stop the mixer, add half of the buttermilk mixture and then return the mixer to low speed just to combine. Add the remaining dry ingredients in two more additions, alternating with the remaining buttermilk mixture. When the last whisper of flour disappears, stop the mixer and use a spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl, then fold the batter to ensure it is evenly mixed. Add the carrots and mix on low until just combined. Unlock the mixer bowl and, using a spatula, gently fold in the pecans and raisins. Evenly divide the batter between the cake pans. (Each portion should weigh around 700 grams, depending on the weight of your carrots.) If needed, smooth out the tops of the cakes with a small offset spatula.

AD

Step 7

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean, and the cakes spring back when lightly pressed on top and start to pull away from the sides of the pan. Transfer the cake pans to a wire rack and let cool completely. Run a thin offset spatula or butter knife around the perimeter of each pan, place a plate over each cake layer and gently invert. Discard the parchment paper.

AD

Step 8

Make the frosting: While the cakes are baking, in a medium bowl, prepare an ice bath. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom and sides constantly, until the solids turn brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Scrape the butter with the browned bits into a bowl and set the bowl over the prepared ice bath; stir every couple of minutes until the butter returns to solid, 13 to 15 minutes. Do not let it get too hard; you want the consistency of room-temperature butter.

AD

Step 9

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter on medium-high speed, stopping the mixer and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl from time to time, until the mixture is completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and salt and mix on medium-high to incorporate.

AD

Step 10

Turn off the mixer and add about a third of the confectioners’ sugar. Start with the mixer on low to incorporate the sugar, and then add the remaining sugar in two more increments, pausing the mixer between additions and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl. Once all of the confectioners’ sugar has been incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is smooth, thick and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Check the bottom of the bowl to make sure all of the confectioners’ sugar has been incorporated; if not, briefly beat to recombine. The frosting will be soft and spreadable; if it feels too soft for spreading, refrigerate for about 20 minutes to firm it up.

AD

Step 11

Assemble the cake: If your cake layers have prominent domes, use a long, serrated knife to trim the tops (you can eat them as a cook’s treat), so the layers are even and level.

AD

Place a cake layer bottom side down on a cake stand or serving plate, and slide strips of parchment paper partially underneath and all around the cake to keep your work area neat during frosting.

Step 12

Using a small offset spatula, place about 1 cup of frosting in the center and spread it out to the edges. Place the second cake layer, bottom side up, on top of the first and top with another 1 cup of the frosting in the center. Using the offset spatula, spread the frosting in a thin layer over the top and sides of the cake to form a crumb coat, adding a little more frosting at a time as needed.

Step 13

Transfer the cake to the refrigerator and let the coating set up (it will be soft and somewhat tacky), about 30 minutes. (You can leave the remaining frosting at room temperature in the meantime, though if it gets too soft, refrigerate it as well while the crumb coat chills.)

Step 14

Remove the cake from the refrigerator and use more frosting to generously cover the top and sides of the cake. (Leftover frosting can be frozen.) To make decorative swirls, move the offset spatula in a figure-eight shape all over the frosting. Refrigerate the cake just until the frosting is set, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day in advance, then slice and serve.

VARIATION: To make traditional cream cheese frosting, follow the instructions above, skipping the butter browning process. Be sure to have the butter at room temperature.

"Fully vaccinated people are at low-risk from travel, CDC says","The long-awaited guidance is still welcome news for the growing number of vaccinated adults who want greater freedom to visit family members and take vacations for the first time in a year. It is also expected to help boost the travel and airline industries that have been seeking a relaxation of the restrictions.

AD

The agency updated its guidance because of several newly released studies documenting the strong real-world effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines, and the rapid pace of vaccinations, now close to 3 million people a day. On Friday, the United States surpassed the milestone of 100 million people getting at least one shot.

AD

But CDC Director Rochelle Walensky cautioned in a White House briefing Friday that while fully vaccinated people can now travel at low risk to themselves, “I would advocate against general travel overall. Our guidance is silent on recommending or not recommending fully vaccinated people travel. Our guidance speaks to the safety of doing so.”

Providing guidance amid a changing pandemic and science is complex, she acknowledged.

AD

“The science shows us that getting fully vaccinated allows you to do more things safely and it’s important for us to provide that guidance even in the context of rising cases,” Walensky said. "" … At the same time, we must balance the science with the fact that most Americans are not yet fully vaccinated, which is likely contributing to a rise in cases.”

For that reason, she said, CDC has to continue to reinforce messages about the critical importance of public health measures such as mask-wearing.

AD

For domestic travel, people who are two weeks past their final shot do not need to get a coronavirus test before or after trips and do not need to self-quarantine after travel unless it is required by a state or local jurisdiction. That means fully vaccinated grandparents can fly to visit their healthy grandchildren without getting a coronavirus test or self-quarantining, provided they follow the other recommended public health measures, such as wearing masks on planes, buses, trains and other forms of public transportation.

AD

For international travel, fully vaccinated people do not need to be tested before they leave the United States unless it is required by the destination, the guidance says. For their return to the United States, fully vaccinated people should get tested and have a negative result before they board an international flight back to the United States. And they should also be tested three to five days after arrival back in the United States.

Nearly 40 percent of all adults have received at least one dose of a vaccine and more than 1 in 5 adults are now fully vaccinated, including more than half of seniors, according to the CDC. On Friday, the United States is expected to pass the milestone of 100 million people getting at least one dose.

AD

Friday’s guidance builds on the agency’s initial recommendations last month that said fully vaccinated Americans can gather with other vaccinated people indoors without wearing a mask or social distancing. Those recommendations also say that vaccinated people can come together in the same way with unvaccinated members in one other household considered at low risk for severe disease, such as vaccinated grandparents visiting healthy children and grandchildren. Fully vaccinated people, the agency said, should keep following health and safety precautions in public, including wearing a mask.

AD

Since the initial guidance was released March 8, the number of Americans who are fully vaccinated has almost doubled, to nearly 60 million people, or about 17 percent of the total population, according to the CDC.

The agency updated its recommendations because of newly released studies showing the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines. In one released Monday of about 4,000 health-care personnel and essential workers, the CDC found the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines reduced the risk of infection by 80 percent two weeks after one shot. Protection increased to 90 percent two weeks after the second dose. The study is significant because it is one of the first to estimate vaccine effectiveness against infection — rather than just monitoring for symptomatic cases — including infections that resulted in no symptoms, according to the CDC.

AD

On Wednesday, Pfizer and BioNTech announced their vaccine was safe and effective in adolescents as young as 12. Data from a trial of the vaccine in nearly 2,300 people between the ages of 12 and 15 will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration in coming weeks, with the hope that vaccinations could begin before the next school year for younger teens, pending a regulatory green light, Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla said. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is currently authorized by the FDA for emergency use for people 16 and older.

AD

On Thursday, new data from the ongoing t rial of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has reinforced early results showing its high efficacy and provided the first hint that the vaccine may work against the more-virulent B. 1.351 variant first detected in South Africa, which has raised global alarm because it can evade some forms of immunity. The updated trial data was announced by news release from the U.S. firm Pfizer and the German company BioNTech and has yet to be peer-reviewed and published.

The CDC’s guidance for nonvaccinated travelers remains the same: They must still get tested one to three days before traveling domestically and again, three to five days afterward. And they should also self-quarantine for seven days after the trip’s conclusion, or for 10 days if they don’t get tested afterward.

AD

The updated recommendations were welcomed by the air and travel industries, which have been pushing the CDC for changes. Last month, airlines recorded their best month for passenger traffic since the pandemic began and CDC’s announcement that travel is considered “low-risk” for those who are fully vaccinated will likely fuel additional demand.

AD

“The CDC’s data suggests that vaccinated individuals don’t transmit the coronavirus, which opens the door much wider for resuming travel, albeit while continuing to carefully follow other health best practices,” said Roger Dow, president of the U.S. Travel Association. “Acknowledging that vaccinations eliminate the need for testing and quarantines removes a key barrier to domestic travel.”

Officials with the Transportation Security Administration said there were 26 days in March when more than a million people moved through security checkpoints. That number is still far below 2019 when TSA was routinely screening more than 2 million passengers a day, but significantly higher than this point last year. For example on April 1 of last year, only 124,021 people moved through those checkpoints.

AD

In addition to urging the CDC to update its travel guidance for the vaccinated, the industry is also pushing the administration to lift restrictions on international visitors. Last month, a coalition of travel groups, including Airlines for America and the U.S. Travel Association, sent a four-page letter to Jeffrey Zients, the White House’s covid-19 response coordinator, saying they were eager to partner with the administration on a plan to reopen the U.S. to international visitors.

AD

In January, the Biden administration had extended a ban on travelers from Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland and 26 other European countries. The administration also added those who had recently been in South Africa to the list. The decision to extend it was part of an effort to help contain the spread of fast-moving variants.

The coalition said in the letter it hoped to have a plan by May 1 that could be implemented this summer, as long as “vaccine distribution and epidemiological trends continue in a positive direction.”",2021-04-02 00:00:00
"With covid protocols, a Caribbean fly-fishing haven is back in business","Turneffe Flats sits on Turneffe Atoll, a 300-square-mile series of hundreds of palm-fringed islands, endless mangroves, clear lagoons, and unbroken reefs — the very picture of pristine Caribbean beauty. It’s roughly 30 miles east of Belize City and is part of the Mesoamerican Reef System, the second-longest barrier reef in the world, stretching 600 miles from Mexico to Honduras. According to Oceanic Society, the habitat here is home to more than 500 fish species and 65 stony corals, as well as manatees, saltwater crocodiles and many other animals that may be encountered during a day’s adventures.

AD

AD

Craig Hayes, an emergency room doctor from South Dakota, helped establish Turneffe Flats in the early 1980s with his wife, Karen.

“I’d started visiting an island named Caye Caulker in the late ’70s and had heard about this spot called Turneffe Atoll from local fishermen,” he recalled. “You had to cross some blue water to get there; the weather had to be right. We tried several times to go and eventually made it. We stayed in a lobster fishing shack.”

One of the fishermen he knew had a brother named Juni Marin, who had leased a piece of property on the atoll from the government. Around the same time, Sports Illustrated had run a story about bonefishing around Turneffe. So, Hayes, said, “We asked Juni if there were any bonefish around the property.”

AD

“ ‘Oh yeah,’ he said. And he took us over to a spot called Grassy Caye, and we saw huge schools of bonefish. After that, we made a deal and formed a company. It was 1981.” Four years later, two bare-bones cabins were ready to welcome Turneffe Flat’s first angling guests.

Hayes’s background as a physician and lodge owner has been propitious. Last spring and summer, he worked closely with the Belizean prime minister’s office to draft coronavirus protocols for tourists, and the country’s pandemic travel response has been widely emulated. To enter Belize, visitors must present one of the following: a negative PCR test within 96 hours of travel, a negative rapid antigen test within 48 hours of travel, or a vaccination card documenting vaccination has been completed at least two weeks before arrival. All visitors must stay at a “Gold Standard”-certified resort; Turneffe Flats was the first property to receive the designation.

“The Belize International Airport reopened on October 1,” Hayes said. “We reopened shortly thereafter. Booking was slow initially, but the last few weeks in March we’ve been at full occupancy.”

It was Turneffe’s excellent flats fishing that first put it on the map. “We send many anglers to Turneffe Flats, and plenty that may be new to saltwater fly-fishing,” said Dylan Rose, saltwater destination manager at Fly Water Travel, a fishing travel agency based in Ashland, Ore. “Whether you prefer to wade or fish from a skiff, the bonefish are plentiful. It also helps that all the guides speak English, which is not always the case at other Caribbean locations.”

AD

AD

More-seasoned anglers, Rose said, visit Turneffe to focus on another game fish called permit. “We have many guests who catch their first permit at Turneffe,” he said. “Achieving a grand slam — catching a bonefish, permit and tarpon on the same day — is also possible in season. This is a momentous occasion for saltwater fly anglers.” (The migratory tarpon, which arrive in late spring, can eclipse six feet and 100 pounds.)

Most fishing is done from a flats skiff. The guide will pole the skiff along on the shallow flats from a platform at the back of the boat, while the angler stands ready to cast from the front. When the guide spots fish, he will call out their location according to the face of a clock (12 o’clock indicating directly off the bow) and distance. Many anglers, caught up in the excitement of facing down their first bonefish or permit, will muff their first few casts. But the guides at Turneffe are calm and patient, and the fish plentiful enough that future opportunities will materialize.

(An added benefit of Turneffe is that bonefish are often present on the flats right in front of the lodge, so anglers who can’t get enough — like yours truly — can pursue them in the hours before breakfast and after the day’s guided fishing.)

AD

AD

“I promised my nephew a flats fishing trip for his college graduation gift,” said Reid Reynolds, a dedicated trout angler from Denver. “It took 18 years, but we finally did it. He recommended Turneffe. I’d never fished for bonefish before and found the ecosystem of the flats amazing. I managed to catch some, but we spent most of our time chasing permit, as my nephew really wanted to catch one.”

“Permit have been my Moby Dick for years,” said his nephew, Eric Shoemaker of Portland, Ore. “I’ve been obsessed. I had 12 good shots at Turneffe. . . . But I came up empty.”

Belize is celebrated for its scuba diving, and Turneffe is convenient to some of the region’s most coveted dive sites. Over the course of a week, diving guests can anticipate 18 dives, including (weather permitting) a trip to the Blue Hole, a giant marine sinkhole with huge stalactites that reaches a depth of more than 400 feet and is renowned for its clear waters and cave formations. “Divers have heard of the Blue Hole, but I think there are even better sites that we visit,” said Rubin Navidad, a dive instructor at Turneffe Flats. One is the Elbow, at the southern end of the atoll. “If the currents are right, we might see huge schools of horse-eye jacks, snappers, kingfish, tuna,” Navidad continued. “There’s so much forage about, the predators are in hunting mode. It’s a very action-packed dive.” [Why is a small village in Belize a hot spot for anglers? It’s home to the Everest of fish]

AD

AD

Divers at Turneffe have access to 65 dive sites. Groups are small, and outings are highly individualized. A weekly night dive is also available, a great chance to encounter octopuses and eels.

For those who prefer to experience the atoll’s natural wonders from the surface, Turneffe Flats offers the Adventure Atoll program, which combines snorkeling, kayak and land tours to gain a better understanding of the region’s ecosystems. With resident naturalist Abel Coe, guests might spend the morning snorkeling a reef to learn about the marine life there and an afternoon paddling the mangroves looking for manatee (25 to 30 live there) and birds. “I also like to take guests on a night walk near the lodge, looking for creepy-crawlies,” Coe said. “We usually can find saltwater-

crocodile nesting sites, boa constrictors, scorpions and tarantulas. Some guests are a little scared at first, but I make it safe and fun.” (Saltwater crocodiles — technically, American crocodiles — can reach over 15 feet in length but are generally not aggressive toward humans.)

“ Abel is incredibly knowledgeable about the life cycle of the reef and its species,” said Peter Winch, a San Francisco-based naturalist and trip leader with Oceanic Society , who was hosting guests during my visit to Turneffe last March . “You come away with the sense that he and his cohorts are truly devoted to protecting the resource. I was very encouraged by the condition of the reefs around Turneffe.”

That the environs around Turneffe remain pristine is not a matter of coincidence. Hayes, along with other conservationists from Belize and abroad, formed the Turneffe Atoll Trust in 2002 to promote the atoll’s conservation efforts while advancing scientific understanding and educating the public about the ecological and economic value of sustainably managing tropical marine habitats.

AD

AD

In 2012, thanks to the trust’s advocacy, the Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve was established — providing a management structure for the atoll’s fisheries and its development.

The rustic cabins of Turneffe Flats’s first incarnation have come a long way. Eight handsome double-occupancy beachside cabanas feature two queen beds, private bath and air conditioning, with a covered deck overlooking the reef. Three villas (two 3-bedroom, one 2-bedroom) with common areas are well-suited for larger groups and families. Guests can enjoy a dip in the infinity pool — perhaps with a cold Belikin beer — while watching anglers cast to bonefish. Breakfast and dinner are served in the lodge building, which also houses a comfortable bar; lunches are usually enjoyed on the water. Dinner entrees range from balsamic short ribs to coconut-

crusted snapper, and many cocktails feature Belizean rum.

Innovations in sustainability at Turneffe Flats include a 250,000-gallon rainwater collection and storage system, a state-of-the-art gray-water recycling system, an aggressive composting and recycling program, and the most recent addition — an off-grid solar system that generates 80 percent of the resort’s electricity.

In a time where many of the world’s great wild places are experiencing decline, the environs of Turneffe Atoll seem to be improving — a sign, perhaps, that humans can make a positive difference while still having fun.

Hiking along Virginia’s Aquia Creek and finding history a stone’s throw from home,"Curiosity — that animating impulse behind all travel — need not be diminished by the pandemic. To the contrary, being stuck at hermitage-like home finds me wondering about things that otherwise never would have captured my attention. In this instance, I was led through some Internet sleuthing to the discovery of something called Aquia Creek sandstone — which in turn led to yet more discoveries about building blocks of iconic places around the world.

AD

AD

Aquia Creek — after which this particular kind of sandstone takes its name — is a tidal tributary of the Potomac about 40 miles south of D.C. Though I live nearby, that there is a historic stone quarry on Aquia Creek is news to me. The quarry is even on the National Register of Historic Places, with a 17-acre park now known as Government Island. It made for a perfect pandemic day trip on a warm afternoon in early March.

My car followed the smartphone’s directions down Interstate 95 to Exit 143A. There it was led around suburban subdivisions to a cul-de-sac with an almost empty parking lot. Understated but informative signage confirmed that I had arrived at the Stafford County park called Government Island. More properly a peninsula (rising 25 to 35 feet above the surrounding wetlands), the place can nonetheless claim to be a metaphorical island in the heart of suburbia — accessible only on foot, with more waterfowl and wildlife than people.

Here, at the trailhead, I stepped onto a pedestrian boardwalk, elevated above scrub vegetation and marsh, that would take me to the historic quarry. It is a loop trail of less than two miles, and I had the place pretty much to myself except for some young couples with kids and/or dogs in tow. On a neighborhood stroll, it appeared — not on a quest like mine.

The first thing I learned from the pathway’s interpretive signs was that George Washington — who lived just upriver at Mount Vernon and who grew up at Ferry Farm only 10 miles away — would have been familiar with Aquia Creek sandstone. Easy to carve and freely split in any direction without shattering, the stone was commonly used throughout Virginia for pediments, quoins and other decorative details in 18th-century houses and churches.

So it is no surprise that in 1791, Pierre L’Enfant leased the island to quarry stone for the new capital city. Then it was known as Brent’s or Wigginton’s Island, after the families who owned it. Visitors today can experience the island pretty much as it was then, since there’s not the huge hole in the ground usually associated with the word “quarry.” Instead, the trail follows the island’s gentle contours around rocky outcroppings that seem to sprout up everywhere, often under a canopy of trees.

AD

AD

Where those rocks have been shaved into sheer, small-scale cliffs, there is evidence of the manual labor (sometimes done by an enslaved person) required to “rough-cut” the sandstone into manageable blocks. Before modern machinery, sledgehammers, wedges and chisels were the only tools available. You get a sense of the strength of will and imagination required to build not only a governmental temple from scratch, but a brand-new country as well.

Carved initials — R.S. — from one 18th-century mason are still clearly visible on a stone set near water’s edge. Scattered on the ground near that stone, alas, was other (impossible-not-to-notice) evidence of humans’ imprint on the island: 21st-century plastic bottles and foam. I should have picked up the litter and carried it away, but I didn’t — finding ready rationalization in possible covid-19 contamination.

To transport the sandstone blocks to the new federal city, skids — or what were sometimes called “stone boats” — were pulled by oxen to a wharf. Small, shallow-draft scows then took the stones to much bigger schooners or sloops, anchored in deeper water, for the trip up the Potomac. The work wasn’t easy: Each cubic square foot of stone weighed about 120 pounds.

On September 18, 1793, President Washington laid the cornerstone — made of Aquia sandstone — for the Capitol building. Like many of his contemporaries, Washington was a Freemason, so the ceremony was colored with Masonic pageantry. The cornerstone’s exact location is now unknown; during the insurrection, the symbolic cornerstone of American democracy — the peaceful transfer of power — was also momentarily lost.

AD

AD

The evenly grained Aquia sandstone is known as a freestone because it can be freely cut and chiseled in any direction without shattering or splitting. Designs by architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe can be seen today in some of the Capitol building’s most elaborate carvings, such as the fluting on interior columns to resemble cornstalks.

But what makes Aquia Creek sandstone easy to shape also makes its exterior susceptible to weathering and erosion. Thus, after the Capitol was burned during the War of 1812, reconstruction made use of marble — a harder, metamorphic rock found on the upper Potomac. I was learning that a rock is not just a rock. I wanted to know more, and reached out to retired University of Virginia geology professor Thomas H. Biggs.

The Aquia Creek sandstone, he explained, was created from river-born sediments over 100 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period. It forms part of the Patuxent Formation — named after the eponymous Maryland river — running north-south along the fall line. Its heavy concentration of feldspar grains — known as arkose — means the rock is inevitably prone to chemical decay.

AD

AD

This deep-time perspective can add appreciation and levels of meaning to any travel destination, I realize. Even during the pandemic, from the laptop in my home, I can roam the world through excursions into geology.

Take the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, for example. Being rebuilt from the 2019 fire, it is not yet open to the public, so I might as well “visit” from the other side of the Atlantic. The cathedral’s building blocks are Lutetian limestone, unique to this part of France, formed in a shallow sea during the Eocene period about 45 million years ago.

The descriptor comes from the Roman name for the place that would become Paris — Lutetia. Much of Parisian architecture, from the Louvre to Haussmann’s 19th-century renovations, relied upon this cream-gray stone of varying brightness — creating the “City of Light” ambiance.

AD

AD

Many of the original quarries and mines, now depleted, lie beneath the city itself. Some were converted into catacombs. More recently, quarries about 30 miles north of Paris specialize in an especially hard variety of Lutetian limestone fashionable in upscale building projects around the world. Like wine or cheese producers, the quarries have even applied for an appellation contrôlée designation.

What I keep learning is that stones, when useful and cherished, seldom stay in one place. Like human travelers, they have stories to tell.

One of the most well-known is Stonehenge, the Neolithic monument on England’s Salisbury Plain. As in all good stories that take on the quality of myth, mysteries are never fully explained, and so it is with Stonehenge as archaeologists and historians are always finding new clues in the rock record. The latest findings seem to confirm the 12th-century Arthurian legend about the wizard Merlin’s capture of a magical stone circle to resurrect it many miles away as a memorial to the dead.

AD

AD

Stonehenge’s familiar ring of vertical standing stones are made of sarsen — a local sandstone weighing roughly 25 tons each. Inside is yet another ring, dating back at least 2,000 years, made of so-called bluestones — igneous rocks, each weighing between two and four tons, not indigenous to the area.

Where these bluestones can be found in abundance, however, is 150 miles away in Wales at a place called the Preseli Hills. Newly discovered remnants of a nearby stone circle seem to confirm the theory that a stone shrine was dismantled and somehow dragged to the Stonehenge site — there to be venerated anew.

The impulse to move rocks and make a mark on the landscape remains very much alive today, as evidenced by cairns left by tourists whether on the Maine coast or Alpine passes. Written not in words but in stones are perhaps the world’s most enduring travel stories.",2021-04-01 00:00:00

Targeted Advertising. You may choose whether to receive some forms of targeted advertising from many ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance . Please see the Online Tracking and Advertising section and visit our Ad Choices pages for further information about how to disable cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to certain types of targeted advertising.

Other Choices. The local laws where you live (e.g., laws of the E.U. and California) may permit you to make certain requests. See the section applicable to the place of your residency below.

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. We do however respond to the Global Privacy Control signal for California residents, as described further in the Privacy Information for California Residents section. You can also see the Online Tracking & Advertising section for additional information about privacy choices that may be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.

Data Security

We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

Children’s Privacy. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

Online Tracking & Advertising

How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies and How To Disable These Technologies

We, our service providers, and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality or measure and analyze ad performance on our Services, may use cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.

Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service.

Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.

Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.

Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.

Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising

As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.

In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .

Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.

Please visit our Ad Choices page for additional information and privacy choices.

In some cases, we and advertisers on washingtonpost.com and other sites work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and audience segment providers, and they use cookies, beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited and mobile apps you use) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads on our site and other sites that they believe you would find most relevant. You can opt out of those vendors’ use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/.

For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.

Often our advertisers contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service for a particular advertisement. In that case, an independent cookie may be used by the third-party service. We do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of cookies from vendors with whom we do not have a contractual relationship.

Targeted Advertising. You may choose whether to receive some forms of targeted advertising from many ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance . Please see the Online Tracking and Advertising section and visit our Ad Choices pages for further information about how to disable cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to certain types of targeted advertising.

Other Choices. The local laws where you live (e.g., laws of the E.U. and California) may permit you to make certain requests. See the section applicable to the place of your residency below.

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. We do however respond to the Global Privacy Control signal for California residents, as described further in the Privacy Information for California Residents section. You can also see the Online Tracking & Advertising section for additional information about privacy choices that may be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.

Data Security

We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

Children’s Privacy. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

Online Tracking & Advertising

How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies and How To Disable These Technologies

We, our service providers, and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality or measure and analyze ad performance on our Services, may use cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.

Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service.

Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.

Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.

Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.

Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising

As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.

In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .

Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.

Please visit our Ad Choices page for additional information and privacy choices.

Published September 16, 2016

Online advertising for washingtonpost.com is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick. DoubleClick places cookies on your browser to facilitate serving particular ads – for instance, to help determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, to tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies for these purposes by visiting http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/.

In some cases, we and advertisers on washingtonpost.com and other sites work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and audience segment providers, and they use cookies, beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited and mobile apps you use) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads on our site and other sites that they believe you would find most relevant. You can opt out of those vendors’ use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/.

Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.

Often our advertisers contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service for a particular advertisement. In that case, an independent cookie may be used by the third-party service. We do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of cookies from vendors with whom we do not have a contractual relationship.
